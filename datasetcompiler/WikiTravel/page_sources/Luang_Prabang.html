<p><b>Luang Prabang</b> (<i>ຫຼວງພຣະບາງ</i>), also <i>Luang Phabang, Luang Phrabang and Louang Phrabang</i> is the former capital of <a href="/en/Laos" title="Laos">Laos</a> and is now a <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List" title="UNESCO World Heritage List">UNESCO World Heritage</a> city.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Understand">Understand</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Luang_Prabang&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Understand">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Set at the confluence of two rivers that almost surround the city, and beneath a temple-topped hill, Luang Prabang is a wonderful patchwork of traditional Lao wooden houses and hints of European architecture; reminders of when Laos was part of the French colony of <i>Indochine</i>. Golden-roofed wats, decorated with mosaics and murals of the life of Buddha, sit under the gaze of wrap-around teak balconies and 19th century shuttered windows. All of this is set against a backdrop of verdant greenery and rugged mountains.
</p><p>One of those small cities with atmospheric and charming personalities, Luang Prabang has topped the Top City category in Wanderlust's annual (popular choice) travel awards several times in recent years (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/magazine/news/wanderlust-travel-awards-2015-the-winners">2015</a>, 2012, 2011, 2010).
</p><p>As a visitor, you cannot help but be amazed by the tidiness and cleanliness of perhaps the most charming city in all of <a href="/en/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. With UNESCO so closely involved and a largely responsible group of local business owners, the pressures of mass tourism development have been held at bay, but for how much longer remains to be seen. Restaurants along the main street tend to be expensive and aimed at luxury tourists, whilst lower cost venues are along the banks of the Mekong.

<p>Luang Prabang rose to prominence as the capital of the first Lao kingdom (<i>Lan Xang</i> - land of the million elephants) from 1353 onwards. The city owes its present name to the <i>Pha Bang</i>, a revered Buddha image (now in the Royal Palace Museum) which was brought to the city by King Visoun during the golden age of <i>Lan Xang</i> in the early 1500s. 
</p><p>The fragmentation of the Lao kingdom at the end of the 16th century saw Luang Prabang become a militarily weak independent city state paying tribute to the surrounding kingdoms. Ultimately the 1887 sacking of the city by the Chinese Haw led the Luang Prabang monarchy to accept the protection of the French, whose influence led to the construction of the many fine colonial villas that sit harmoniously alongside the traditional Lao architecture.
</p><p>The city fell into decline in the latter half of the 20th century following the reluctant withdrawal of the French, and the 1975 revolution which brought an end to the Luang Prabang monarchy. The relative poverty of newly-independent Laos perhaps helped save Luang Prabang from the ravages of 20th century city planning.

<p>The reopening of Laos to tourism in 1989 resulted in a remarkable turnaround in the city's fortunes, as crumbling timber houses and colonial mansions were sensitively restored and transformed into immaculate guesthouses and boutique hotels. In 1995 the city was placed on the <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List" title="UNESCO World Heritage List">UNESCO World Heritage List</a>.

<p>The new airport opened in 2013 and is much larger, clean and fairly quiet for an international airport. 
</p><p>Visa-on-Arrival is available at the airport. The price is USD40 (for all nationalities), with an additional USD as "visa fee". You need a passport picture to obtain a visa. If you don't have one, they'll scan your picture from your passport and charge you an additional 1 USD. Ensure you have USD otherwise you will need to use the ATM outside the front entrance or exchange money at the exchange counter. Exchange rates at the airport are reasonably competitive with the prevailing outside rates, unlike a lot of other international airports.

</p><p>ASEAN nationals do not need a visa to enter Laos for stays not exceeding 30 days, except Myanmar and Brunei which 14 days.
</p><p>Visa extensions are possible at the Immigration Office opposite the Rama Hotel. The price is USD 2/day plus a USD 2 form fee. The process is very easy; turn up in the morning with your passport and one photo; fill in a form (in Luang Prabang they do this for you) and come back in the afternoon for your extension.
</p><p>Taxis into the city cost about USD6, whether you are by yourself or with 3 other people. There is a taxi counter just outside the arrival hall.
As of June 2015, you are required to buy a taxi ticket for 80,000 kip per person for a seat on a shared van taxi into the city. There are tuk-tuks driving down the main road which charge about 20,000 kip for one person into the city. If there are a couple of you then you can get a better price. Most guesthouses can organise pickups for about 100,000 kip.

<p>From Hanoi, Vietnam, one could take a 30 hour bus for VND850,000 (<i>December 2013</i>) to Luang Prabang. Just ask any travel agency or hotel receptionist, not many offer this service, but you can find it if you try hard enough. It is easy to find Hanoi to Vientiane (24h) for 450 000VND or Dien Bien Phu &gt; Luang Prabang (24h) for 500 000 VND (April 2016)
</p><p>Highway 13 connects Luang Prabang to <a href="/en/Vang_Vieng" title="Vang Vieng">Vang Vieng</a> and <a href="/en/Vientiane" title="Vientiane">Vientiane</a> in the south and via Highway 1 to the north. Highway 13 is asphalt and in relatively good shape during dry season all the way to Vientiane. Simply put, it is long, bumpy, and winding road trip. The road resembles of a lunar landscape and there are endless potholes due to poor quality surface, the top layer eroded to reveal the gravel underlayer, which causes a bumpy ride. Though there have been incidents of violence along this stretch of road in the past, presently it is safe.
</p><p>Upon arrival at a bus station, there will be tuk-tuks that will cram in as many tourists as possible for a flat 30,000 kip (10,000 kip after negotiation and pointing to the information panel from the bus station displaying the tuk-tuk fees for the city-centre. (If you are a big group, probably you will be more lucky in negotiation) to the city centre, which is near the Royal Palace. Many tourists alight here, but if your hotel is not nearby you can request that the driver take you to your hotel at no extra charge, as long as it's within the historic part of the city.
</p><p>There are three bus stations, each a little bit out of the city, which serve different directions. Tuk-tuk drivers know which bus station to go to for which destination. Ask around for bus schedules. 
</p><p>Tickets can be bought at every travel agent in the city, which makes more sense than buying them at the bus station as there is only a difference of roughly 20,000 kip, which pays for the the tuk-tuk from place of accommodation to the bus station (45min walking for southern station, 55min for nothern station), so it nullifies the gain. Pick those agencies which absorb the shuttle ride from the fare quote as others do not. Compare first before biting the quote. Book tickets in advance, particularly for "VIP" buses as they have reserved seats, and you don't want to end up sitting next to the toilet. If you have a preference for aisle or window seat, ask for a seat before the toilet (i.e., between the toilet and front of the VIP bus) where the seat numbers are predictable. The seat numbering jumps a couple seats after the toilet (which is located in the middle left of the bus), and what should have been an aisle seat number becomes a window seat number and vice versa.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_boat">By boat</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Luang_Prabang&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: By boat">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Boats ply the Mekong to and from <a href="/en/Huay_Xai" class="mw-redirect" title="Huay Xai">Huay Xai</a> at the Thai border, stopping in <a href="/en/Pakbeng" title="Pakbeng">Pakbeng</a> where you can catch overland connections towards the northeast and the border with <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a>. The trip takes 2 days (both days about 9 hours) by slow boat, or 6 bone-rattling hours by speedboat. There are also operators now offering 2-day "luxury" cruises.
</p><p>Expect to spend the night in Pakbeng if you're taking a slow boat (the safest option), or to arrive in Luang Prabang deaf, shaken and either exhausted or exhilarated from six hours in a speedboat. If you leave Huay Xai in the afternoon you can get a speedboat to Pakbeng (~3hrs) and join the slowboat from there, this might save you a night in Huay Xai.
There is also a twice-weekly "one day comfortable boat" between Luang Prabang and Huay Xai, but the cost is significantly higher.  
</p><p><b>Slow boats</b> leave every day, the last one at 11:00 (if there are enough people [who are slow getting through Laos immigration] boats will leave up until approx 12:30). The trip from Luang Prabang to Huay Xai costs at least 220,000 kip. As opposed to the numerous travel agencies in town the official tourist information and the actual boat pier ticket counter will provide you with the current official price for the boat ticket and departure times. The trip to Luang Prabang from Huay Xai costs around THB1000 /220,000 kip or 110,000 kip to Pakbeng (2015). If you take your bicycle on the boat it will be transported on the roof of the boat and will cost 25,000 Kip from Luang Prabang to Pakbeng and the same from Pakbeng to Huay Xai (2015). If you don't buy the ticket via a travel agency (which will likely cost you up to 100,000 Kip more) but directly at the ticket counter you can only buy the ticket to Pakbeng. The next day you will buy your ticket from Pakbeng to Huay Xai directly on the boat. If you have booked your boat trip via a travel agency, be sure to retain your ticket stub as they check again when you board again at Pakbeng.
</p><p>Make sure you stock up on food and drink before traveling as the on board prices are practically double (20,000 kip as opposed to 10,000 at a restaurant). Many guest houses at Pakbeng sell small, but somewhat pricey, packed lunches for the onward journey.
</p><p>In Huay Xai take a tuk-tuk from the border crossing to the boat landing (10&#160;km, THB100 per passenger) and purchase your tickets at the boat landing because all the tour agencies in the city charge a commission, and agents usually don't have reliable information about the quality of the boats. It is common to have to switch to a different boat in Pakbeng, so you may end up in a boat of higher or lower quality for the second half of the journey. The two day boats have nice comfortable car seats, and so it is no longer necessary to purchase any cushions.
</p><p>You can buy a Huay Xai to Luang Prabang ticket from Huay Xai guesthouses but at the Port you can only buy a ticket to Pakbeng. When you board the Luang Prabang boat after the night in Pakbeng, a registered ticket seller will come around checking 'through' tickets and selling tickets for that day's travel to LP. 
</p><p>The slow-boat is generally packed, so much so that there may not be enough seats to go round. If you insist before leaving, plastic chairs may be added for the benefit of the unlucky late-comers. Arriving early will mean a longer day, but most likely a better seat, towards the front and away from the incredibly loud engine (maybe take ear-plugs just in case). The best seats are located near the captain as they allow access to large open 'doors', however, this area can get cramped with locals and their belongings or alternatively with shouting, Samsong-drinking party-backpackers while the few locals are shoved in the back.
</p><p>The slow boat trip proceeds at a pleasant 20-30&#160;km/h and offers nice views to the nature and village life on the banks of the Mekong river. Most of the passengers are foreign tourists. Occasional locals take the boat only for short hops between the river side villages, but prefer to take the bus for the full distance from Huay Xai to Luang Prabang. So you won't be able to observe many local boat travelers, the boat ride offers just the usual sight of tourists drinking Beerlao but is a great way to meet other tourists and discuss route plans and travel info or get very sick of them. 
</p><p>Previously the slow boat stopped right in the middle of the city. But now the official slowboat pier is ~7&#160;km out of the city and everyone is then forced to take a tuk tuk. If you do not wish to participate in this you can gather a group of people and start walking to the city on your own (turn right from the boat landing). The tuk tuk drivers will follow you and within 50&#160;m the price will drop to 15,000 kip per person. Walking a little further will probably drop the price even more since in about 250&#160;m you will come across a busy road (turn right to go to Luang Prabang) where it should be easy to get transport. If you do not find transport on the road itself then there is a petrol station about 500&#160;m further where there are always tuk tuk drivers filling up.
</p><p>When you disembark the slow boat it is a very steep combination of stairs and earthen bank to the road. A tourist fell backwards with the weight of her backpack and broke her leg in May 2015. You might be approached by a tout offering to take you into the city for a very inflated price. What he's doing is very dishonest as he will carry your backpack to the road and then demand payment, and then you still have to buy your 20,000 kip tuk tuk ticket at the office on the road to get into the city. 
</p><p>There is an agency (Bo-Sapphire) in Huay Xai which offers trips from Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang. Tickets which are sold by local agencies and hotels in Chiang May include minibus transfer to Chiang Khong (Thai bank), border/Mekong crossing to Huay Xai and the slow boat ride as described above. Tickets are collected by the driver when you enter the minibus in Chiang Mai and you will be left with no proof of payment and services included. The minibus will drop you at a very dirty "hotel" in Chiang Khong with damaged buildings, urine-stained bedsheets, and disgusting meals. Consider walking around the city to find a better place. If you book the "B" package which includes accommodation in Pakbeng you will find that breakfast, lunch package, and transfer to the pier is not included although you paid for it but are not able to prove. Phone numbers and email address displayed on the company's stand at Huay Xai immigration counter and on their buses are defunct. So you cannot contact them.
</p><p>If you choose to travel on the <b>speedboat</b> (a light canoe with a very powerful engine), a crash helmet and life-jacket will be provided, but once you have taken the trip you will realize they are mostly show only and will not help you if something goes wrong. Regardless, it is not recommended you travel in a speedboat without this safety equipment. It is also recommended that you make your bags as waterproof/water-resistant as possible and wear a rain jacket. The boat can generate quite a bit of spray, plus any showers you might encounter along the way will sting like needles against any exposed skin. On sunny days, sunscreen is invaluable as there is no roof/shade on these speed machines. The journey to Huay Xai can be reduced to as few as 4 hours in the wet season, with a lunch stop at Pakbeng. However, some consider this means of transportation less safe, especially in the dry season when boats travelling at 80&#160;km/h come within a few metres of exposed rocks. Earplugs are strongly recommended. Those concerned about their environmental impact may want avoid speedboats, as they are heavier polluters than the slower options. Speedboats run on LPG with boats stopping regularly to get supplies (8 bottles required per trip) and it is not overly comforting to the weak-hearted to have two full bottles at the front of your boat as you negotiate 3&#160;m diameter whirlpools to avoid  m rocky outcrops almost close enough to touch. Travel agents in Luang Prabang will sell the tickets for 320,000-370,000 kip, you will need a minivan to take you the 10&#160;km north to the fast boat pier. Unless you're an adrenalin junky, look for other transport options.
</p><p>The third option is to take a <b>"luxury" cruise</b>. The major operators are <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.luangsay.com">Luang Say</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.nagiofmekong.com/">Nagi of Mekong</a>. Both operate two-day cruises to Hauy Xai that stop in Pakbeng for the night. A third player, Shompoo Cruise, has now entered the market. Although the journey takes as long as taking the slow boat, these operators offer vastly superior facilities and equipment than public slow boats, and you should be prepared to pay a premium for it. Tickets for all three operators can be bought at most travel agents in the city.
</p><p>Prices are approximately 400,000 kip for a slowboat (150,000 for bicycle transportation), 280,000 kip for a speedboat. 3,000,000 kip for Luang Say, 1,200,000 kip for Nagi of Mekon and (both including a night in a hotel) and 640,000 kip for Shampoo. There are reports that prices for Luang Say and Nagi of Mekong can be bargained down.
</p><p>There is no public boat service to Vientiane, but it may be possible to do the trip by private tourist boat when the water levels are high enough. Read more about fast and slow boats in the <a href="/en/Laos" title="Laos">Laos</a> country guide.

<ul><li><b>Pha Tad Ke Botanical Garden</b> &#8212; <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pha-tad-ke.com/">[1]</a> Laos' first botanical garden has a plant collection of over 2000 species, with the aim of preserving Laos' biodiversity, educating the local community, and providing a top rated sustainable tourism destination for visitors. A half day visit gets you a boat ride down the Mekong,access to the garden, a tea tasting, an optional one hour hike to a cave, orchid and garden history talks, and a bamboo handicraft session with a local expert. Unwind from your visit by enjoying top rated Laotian fusion food at the Pha Tad Ke cafe. For 200,000 kip, the price may initially seem high, but given all that is included people end up leaving satisfied with their investment. The office is on the Mekong, close to the post office. ☎ +071261000. Hours: 08:00-18:00. Check with office what activities are on offer each day as they get canceled sometimes.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Alms ceremony</b> &#8212; monks at dawn (05:30) collecting alms of rice from kneeling villagers and tourists, who form the majority, along Sakkaline Road near Wat Sensoukharam. Just look for the long row of rice baskets and stools that have been laid out for tourists who have paid for the privilege of giving alms. Seeing these tourists, who make up the majority of the alms-givers, seated on plastic stools participating out of fun rather than sincerity definitely reduces the authenticity of the moment. To make things worse, some are dressed inappropriately: please, if you want to give alms, at least cover up and do not show the monks your cleavage. Ask your guest house host to assist you the day before in preparing if you'd like to get up and give alms in the morning. Please note that the alms giving ceremony is one which, while picturesque, is not without its detractors. Unscrupulous local merchants have used the eagerness of tourists to participate in a local tradition as a means of making easy money, and sometimes sell unsuitable, stale and even unsafe food. This has resulted in monks falling ill after having consumed the offerings, and resistance to continuing the tradition. However, the government has made it clear that the monks have to continue the tourist pageant or risk being replaced with lay people clothed in saffron robes in order to keep up appearances, and thereby maintain tourist revenue. So if you wish to participate in this ceremony, prepare the food or fruit yourself, and avoid giving food of unknown quality. Another problem is the photography: while it looks nice on your collection, think about how it must feel for the monks to have hundreds of tourists photographing them every day. Some lowlifes even stand right next to them, flashing them in the eyes. Strongly consider only watching this old tradition from a distance instead of using it as a tourist attraction, as this may detract from the beauty of the ritual - both for locals and tourists alike. You can always download a picture of it somewhere on the net for your collection.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Haw Kham</b> &#8212; the former royal palace and now national museum, 30,000 kip, no photo/video/bag/shoes allowed, free locker. Open 08:00-11:30 and 13:30-16:00 every day except Tuesday. There's also sometimes local drama or dance performances in the adjacent theatre. In August 2011, on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, there were performances at 18:30 of "Search of Princess Sida", a royal ballet, with prices from 80,000 to 150,000 kip. It's important to check the timings and plan the visit accordingly. Visiting the gardens it appears is free. Only to visit the inside of museum need tickets.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Phou Si/Chomsy Hill</b> &#8212; the main hill in the city from which you have a good view of the whole area. It's not a very steep climb from the bottom and sunrise and sunset are the most sensible and rewarding times to go up. There is a near-panoramic view from the top. There are 2 entrances from ground level: 1 on the north along Sisavangvong Road, facing the Royal Palace, and another one on the East, on Sisavang Vatthana Road. The northern entrance has about 130 steps up to the ticket counter, and another 190 steps to the top. Even folks with low fitness levels should be able to complete the climb, although it can be tiring for the unfit. The eastern entrance is longer than the northern one by a factor of 2 or 3, and is hence less steep and has more points of interest along the way, which are perfect excuses for stopping for a breather on the climb. Entrance fee 20,000 kip. Very easy walk at a slow pace.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Sunset on the waterfront</b> &#8212; take a walk along the Mekong, or sit and enjoy dinner at one of the many restaurants and watch the sun sink into the horizon. If having dinner, make sure to bring some mosquito repellent or wear long trousers. Mosquitoes love stationary targets.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Vat Xieng Toung</b> &#8212; the oldest monastery in the city and one of the most beautiful. Opens from 06:00-18:00. Entry fee 20,000 kip. One entrance on the road along Mekong river, the other on the by-lane off the main road.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Vipassana temple and park</b> &#8212; this golden temple, highly visible from Phou Si, is a shrine for Buddhists who practice Vipassana meditation.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Vat Khili, Vat Sibounheuang, Vat Sirimoungkhoun Sayaram, Vat Sop Sickharam</b> &#8212; small cozy nice temples. Really great atmosphere of real temples. Located near Vat Xieng Toung. No entrance fee.</li></ul>

<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Kuang_Si_Falls"><span class="fn org">Kuang Si Falls</span>. <span class="hours">08:00-17:30</span>. <span class="description">A large multi-stage waterfall, accessible by boat or truck hire, some 29&#160;km south of Luang Prabang. You can rent a motorbike/bicycle to transport yourself there. Parking your motorbike/bicycle at the entrance costs 2,000 kip. There are food and tourist stalls outside the waterfalls. It is worth putting a whole day or more aside for seeing this because it is a great place to relax and meet others. There are multiple pools at different levels, all of which are reportedly safe to bathe in, and are extremely picturesque. Shared tuk-tuks to go there charge about 30 to 50,000 kip. The cheapest seems to be near slow boat pier, though you can get them for 40,000 kip near JoMa Bakery. You may have to wait until the tuk-tuk fills up. Tuk-tuks are legally only allowed to take six people, and there is a checkpoint at the falls, so some drivers may try to get a 7th person in the front seat. A private tuk-tuk will cost you around 150,000 kip after some haggling. Drivers will try to show you some documents that quote 200,000 kip or more. Ignore it and insist on your price. Try and go with 5 people and insist on 30,000 kip each. Drivers should wait for 3-4 hours for you at the waterfall gate area. Make sure your 150,000 kip includes transport there and back. Bargain, bargain, bargain. Just remember that there are dozens of tuk-tuks around, so you have the advantage. If on your own, propose 30,000 kip, and if you have the patience wait until he finds more people. A seat in a mini bus costs 40,000 kip, more if booked through travel agent. Be careful of leeches in the water, especially if you climb to the top of the top of the falls. There is a lot of leeches in the water.</span> <span class="price">Admission, 20,000 kip</span>. </span> ++ After ticket counter walk up the paved road on the left to the main waterfall and then walk back along the water trail. Entrance to main falls only 15 miniutes walk.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Pak_Ou_Caves"><span class="fn org">Pak Ou Caves</span>. <span class="description">The famous "Buddha caves" are north of the city on the Mekong and can be reached by road (approx 1h) or river boat (around 1.5h). Alternatively, you can hire canoes and a guide for the day, which will allow you to view the beautiful scenery and visit the caves without throngs of other tourists. It's also possible to finish the trip at the "whisky village" where the local Laolao rice spirit is made. Those caves were used as a storage unit to keep the damaged Buddha statues (it is considered bad luck to throw them away, so they are often stored in caves) and were made a tourist attraction; if you ever been to any cave before, it is not worth a dedicated visit as you're likely to be disappointed. There are two caves: one on the entry level and another, the upper caves, on top of the hill, a very steep climb. A torch is recommended to see the upper cave, and will be given on entrance. Ticket for a round boat tour to Pak Ou Caves (with stop at the whisky village) costs 65,000 kip (Jan. 2015) per person and can be purchased at the pier (first boat takes off at 08:30 but the ticket office is open at 8). Note that the 65,000 kip boats only depart in the morning around 8.30. If you come later in the day you can only get a private boat, meaning you'll need at least a party of 4 to make it competitive on price. If you book a "half-day tour Pak Ou" at the local tourist office, make sure if the entrance fee is included in the price, or the whole "service" to be provided is just selling you a boat ticket with surcharge; in the latter case, just go to the pier (at Mekong river, easy to find) and buy the tickets yourself. Simply cross the river for for 3,000-5,000 kip, walk up the hill and turn to the right crossing the primary schools to find your way to the caves.</span> <span class="price">20,000 kip</span>. </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Tad_Sae_Waterfalls"><span class="fn org">Tad Sae Waterfalls</span>. <span class="description">Stepped waterfalls which are not as big as Kuang Si, but very beautiful. You can bathe there, and elephant rides are also available. Though the most people stop at the main waterfalls near the entrance, you can walk alongside the streams for couple of miles and find more waterfalls. You must take a river boat 10,000 kip per person (each way) to reach the place. Motorbike/Bicycle parking is 5,000 kip.  If arriving by motorbike from Luang Prabang, get on route 13 south (towards Vientiane), and there will be a left turn after the 372 kilometre <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_location_marker">highway marker</a>, right after a petrol station.  There isn't much of a sign; if you reach the 371 kilometre highway marker, you've gone too far.</span> <span class="price">Admission, 15,000 kip</span>. </span></li></ul>

<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Tad_Thong_Waterfall_and_Nature_Trail"><span class="fn org">Tad Thong Waterfall and Nature Trail</span>,  (<span class="note directions">6&#160;km from the city centre, off Route 13 south to Vientiane</span>). <span class="description">The waterfalls are not as spectacular as the Kuang Si but there is a paved 50 minute walk through the jungle through a forest of huge trees dotted with picnic areas. Closed for many years but now open. Water from the falls cascades into a big lake that you can swim in. A natural location with not many tourists, but there is a restaurant. Go by tuk-tuk, minivan, or rent a scooter or bicycle. The last 2.8&#160;km of the road there is unpaved, quite rocky and a little steep in places, so if you're driving on your own, make sure you're comfortable off road. <b>Note</b>: as of August 2014, some of the pathways are in a bad state of disrepair and/or flooded, and you will need to get your feet wet at least once to get to the end of the path.</span> </span></li></ul>

<p>This is an enjoyable way to gain insights into Lao culinary methods and traditions. There are three substantial cooking class providers in the city, all attached to popular restaurants, using Lao chefs/instructors. They differ somewhat in style and content, but all start with a tour of the local food market and include transport and copies of their recipes and other information about Lao cuisine. Participants sit down to eat their dishes afterwards. 
</p>

<p>Thai baht and US dollars are widely accepted but the exchange rates vary. There are some ATMs accepting Visa, MasterCard, Maestro and Eurocards. These ATMs are situated mostly in Sisavangvong Road near the end of the Night Market. The ATMs dispense currency in Lao kip and some of them (such as Banque Franco-Lao) allow a maximum withdrawal of 2,000,000 kip with a charge of 40,000 kip. BCEL ATMs allow 1,500,000 kip with a charge of 20,000 kip. Multiple withdrawals are allowed to a daily maximum of 5,000,000 kip. If you arrive by plane, there is an ATM right outside the entrance, and a money changer at the airport which is open for a few hours of the day, so don't count on changing there. Also, their rates are significantly worse than the banks in the city.
</p><p><b>Money Changers/Exchange</b> 
</p><p>For Malaysians, it is best to change money to baht, where the rate is MYR10 = THB100 or more, then change the baht to kip in Laos. This is because they give not so good rates in Laos for Malaysian ringgit.
</p><p>There are a number of money changers who generally do not offer good rates, and are located either on Sisavangvong Rd or in the permanent markets further east. One is next to the ATM near the Night Markets, another is about 50&#160;m further north along the street, located out the front of one of the first restaurants (looks like a little tollbooth). The rates offered may vary, so shop around before you change. It maybe better to stick with official money changing services at a bank which are easily found. There are reports of scam by using money changers to take cash advance. They will charge you more in US$ with different exchange rate than written, and even after complaining it's not possible to cancel the transaction.
</p><p>Beware also of money changers giving you 1,000 kip notes instead of 10,000. The notes look similar.
</p><p>Also, beware of Vangmisay Money Changer in Ban Choumkong. Always remember to count your money in front of the money changer immediately after the transaction. Avoid Vangmisay at all costs.
</p><p>The <b>Night Market</b> (on Sisavangvong Road) caters to tourists with every kind of souvenir you could want and closes at about 22:00. Particularly good are the duvet covers, cushion covers, and pillow sets. They will custom manufacture one to your dimensions in one day. It is well worth a look and the hawkers are very pleasant to deal with and amazingly non-pushy by Asian standards. Traders range from young children to the elderly who usually make the items they sell. Good-natured bargaining is advisable, but don't obsess over this and ruin your experience as well as giving the trader a bad day. It should be understood that the quality and design of goods is lower in the market than in the legions of increasingly chic shopss in the city. 
</p><p>There may well be some souvenirs available made from endangered animals. Avoid buying rare pets, leather, ivory, talons, dried sea creatures (starfish, etc.), fur, feathers, teeth and other products. Same for the lao lao whisky bottles with scorpions and snakes. This is the best place to buy lower end souvenirs and hone your bargaining skills.
</p><p>The Lao aesthetic sense is quite evolved in its own way, and this can be seen in the higher-end or artisan-direct shops:

<p>Several book shops sell photocopied books, and so it's worth checking the copies as pages can be unreadable or even missing. Also, such copies may be illegal in your country.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Book Exchange</b> The Tamnak Lao Restaurant no longer offers a book exchange, and it was slim pickings at L'Etanger. In Feb 2018, the best place in town to exchange foreign-language books was at Novelty Cafe, at the start of main street. It's a 1-for-1 exchange plus $2 that is donated to a local literacy program. All books are also available to purchase.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Public Library</b> During lunchtime, which is around 12:00 to 13:30, the dry summer sun can be scorching. To spend time comfortably while waiting for the sun to mellow at around 15:30, hang around at the public library across from the national museum about 4 or 5 buildings along. Travelers can't check out books, but you can read them here. There are many books about local sites and customs, Lao cookbooks, art books with local links, etc. You'll also find English language newspapers issued months ago still in circulation. Or surf the net for free from the six Internet stations.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Movie Night at L'Etranger</b> L'Etranger tea shop shows English-language movies nightly on a widescreen TV in their big upstairs space. A sign out front lists what movies they'll show for the coming week. The movie is free, but a purchase of a drink or food from their regular menu is expected (in Feb 2018, drinks start at 12k, but 20k+ is more common; food from 25k and up). Movies start at 7pm, but it's wise to go earlier to find a seat and place your order, as popular movies pack the house.</li></ul>

<p>There are no McDonald's restaurants or any other multi-national fast food outlets in Luang Prabang, or elsewhere in Laos.
</p><p>Restaurants line Sisavangvong Road and the roads along the Mekong and Nam Khan. Food runs the line from standard SE Asian backpacker fare to more traditional Lao dishes, including buffalo sausage, right up to very high quality French cuisine. 
</p><p>There are also numerous market stalls for cheaper food, including baguettes, crepes, and pancakes. Stalls along an alleyway between the night market end of Sisavangvong Road and the Mekong offers superb Lao street food at bargain prices.
</p><p>The much recommended street-food market located east of the Tourist Information building as posted on PBS Gourmet.com, said to be one of the must-see street food markets in SE Asia is quite disappointing though. A dozen or so buffet dishes per table-stall is offered at 15,000 kip (as of February 2015) per plate. They are displayed in aluminum basins with no warmers and by the time it's 20:00, the food is cold (however most vendors are more than willing to heat up your food in a wok, after which it's a lot more palatable). The taste is also bland, nothing outstanding or super noteworthy more than any indifferent buffet offerings in other parts of the world. Also, one must contend with a barrage of flies. Basically, if one sees one table, one has seen it all.  However, there is large range of salad items and because everyone is packed into the tables to eat, it is a great way to meet other travelers.
</p><p>While the buffet tables are the cheaper way to eat, be wary of the hygiene and note the distinct lack of local customers which is an indicator of the standard of food on offer. You'll never encounter fatter flies elsewhere in SE Asia. For a bit more, a tasty alternative are the grilled fish, chicken legs, and buffalo sausages sold just before the main "buffet" area. Delicious and worth every overcharged kip. Even tastier if you are tired of fried rice from the dozens of cafes that have sprung up on every corner. 
</p><p>A large Beerlao should not cost more than 10,000 kip, and 8,000 kip for the small dark variety, pretty much standard throughout the country. Most riverside places offer the same prices for beer and generally the same foods. Prices of food can vary wildly, though. Shop around and don't be shy about asking prices directly if anything is unclear.
</p><p>Probably the one dish most recommended is the Lao version of fried spring roll: vegetarian at 3,000 kip, or pork at 5,000 kip per piece.
</p><p>The bundles of dried seafood snack have a texture is like chewing salty paper. 
</p><p><b>Local specialities</b> include:
</p>
<ul><li>French baguettes and other bakery items.</li>
<li>Local watercress, which is very peppery.</li>
<li>Fried dried seaweed with sesame seeds dipped in a chili sauce.</li>
<li>Buffalo steaks and sausages.</li>
<li>Luang Prabang Khao Soi: spicy clear mince and noodle soup which is very different from the Chiang Mai version. Try a great one at the crossroad to the night market for 15,000 kip</li></ul>

<p>There are a number of places to drink around Luang Prabang, though the late-night club scene is pretty much nonexistent. The liveliest and busiest bars are in a small cluster between Mount Phousi and the Nam Khong.
</p><p>Luang Prabang's status means that curfews are strictly enforced here: bars start winding down at 23:00 and close at 23:30 sharp. The only permitted late-night options are outside the main part of the city: a discotheque patronised mostly by locals and a ten pin <b>bowling alley</b>.
</p><p>If you do plan on staying out after hours, check the arrangements with your guesthouse first to avoid being locked out.
</p><p>If you're simply looking to relax and enjoy the river views, most riverside restaurants have tables outside where you can sit back with a beer or two.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Books and Tea L'Etranger</b> - downstairs is a book shop/swap and upstairs is a bar selling drinks and cake in a room covered in cushions for lazing around and reading. Movies everyday at 19:00. A tad greedy and unfriendly on the book exchange business. Definitely overpriced. They even charge you for reading one of their used books on spot.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The <b>Bowling Alley</b> Changed its location to stand close to the Chinese Provincal Hospital, 2&#160;km out of the city. Serves Beerlao and whisky well into the early hours of the morning to a raucous backpacker crowd, and also happens to be a bowling alley (20,000 kip per person per game after midnight). Even the addition of lanes doesn't seem to have dented the emphasis on drinking. This is invariably reached by crowds of people sharing tuk-tuks, which cluster around the bottom end of Phousi Rd around the time the bars close.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Mekong Sunset Beach Bar</b> - The place to go to watch the sunset. Located at the river mouth of Nam Khan and Mekong, you have to cross the bamboo bridge behind Wat Xieng Thong and walk 3 min. Very simple but unbelievable. Floods in the wet season.</li></ul>

Gorgeous views along the Nam Khan River. One of the best located bars in Laos and creatively decorated. The food and shakes are great, especially the burgers. Cocktails are on point, too. Caters to backpackers wanting to chill, but other than the beer there is nothing Laoatian about this place with a clichéd backpacker facilities including board games, scatter cushions, giant Jenga and volleyball court.

Luang Prabang has the best selection of accommodation in Laos, with something to suit every budget. There is everything from tent sites under a roof for 20,000 Kip per night up to super luxury hotels at USD1,500 per night.
</p><p>Don't expect all the facilities that can be found in Vietnam or Cambodia - aircon, cable TV, internet -  in Luang Prabang for USD12.
</p><p>While the big chains have yet to make an appearance, there's plenty of "boutique" accommodation, although this heavily overused word runs the gamut from quirky to luxury. Most of the lanes and alleys all through Luang Prabang have places to stay, with a large selection also found in the lanes south of the Post Office. Free Wi-Fi is quite commonplace in Budget guesthouses.

<p><b>Motorbike rental</b>
Recently there have been (Sep 2013 ­and Jan 2014) multiple reports of rental scam in Luang Prabang where the rented scooter is stolen in the city by the renter, be warned about it. Take your own lock and do not leave your passport as a deposit.
</p><p><b>Monk Alm Ceremony Scam</b>
A scam operates during the early morning alms ceremony preying on unsuspecting sleepy tourists. When watching the procession of the monks, beware if one or several Lao ladies approach you encouraging you to give food to the monks as they walk along the street receiving alms from Buddhist pilgrims. The Lao ladies, who aren't themselves Buddhist, will give you a mat, and rice to give to the monks. (The rice is often poor quality and disrespectful to the monks). When the ceremony is over, they will take you to a nearby temple and encourage you to bow to a shrine or statue of Buddha, and then ask you to pay for the rice they gave you. They can insist on receiving very large sums of money before letting you go. 
If you want to give to the monks, it's best to ask your hotel to organize it for you, but if you aren't Buddhist, it is respectful to watch quietly from across the road and refrain from participating.
</p><p><b>Night Market Vendor Scam</b>
Vendors in the night market will often change the price of goods once they have money in hand. (ie. 14,000 becomes 40,000 etc) Be sure to reiterate the price when haggling and always pay with exact change.
</p><p><b>Tuk Tuk from Slow Boat pier</b>
If you try to bargain the price for the Tuk Tuk to the city please make sure to pay the exact amount or to make sure other people saw the banknote. They can try to give you less change. We saw this happen to a family with small kids.

<p>Bottled water is more expensive than other South East Asian countries, but still cheap by western standards.  Expect to pay 3000 kip for a small bottle or 5000 for a large. To reduce plastic waste, you can refill your bottles as you go along from your hotel's/guest house's or tour agent's office water dispenser. 
</p><p>If you can't find one along the backpacker's area, go to the lobby of the Phra Lang Phra Lao, a separate building besides the National Museum, beyond the huge King Sisavangvong statue, and re-supply. The water dispenser is at the righthand side at the far end of the corner from the entry door. There is also an available toilet with no charge. Or ask at any shop or agent.

Scam&#160;: smaller look alike small boat will claim they are the small boat going to Pakbeng for 110 000.

<li><a href="/en/Hanoi" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> by long distance bus (make sure you have the Vietnamese visa beforehand.), 360,000 kip, 24 hours direct bus</li></ul>
<p>You can buy the ticket to Hanoi from a tour agent, or you can walk to the Southern Bus Station (30 mins walk) and buy it yourself for cheaper. You shouldn't buy the ticket at the station itself, but opposite the station you'll see some buses waiting and there will be an office of the Naluang Travel Company. They are the ones that operate the buses, so if you buy anywhere else the ticket will be more expensive.
</p><p>Also note that they claim to sell a ticket to Hanoi at the Northern Bus Station and for only 150,000 Kip, but this will take you only until the border and then you'll be left at the mercy of the local drivers who can charge you any amount, since you're in the middle of nowhere. Don't mistake the Northern bus station with the Southern.
</p><p>It is preferable to buy tickets to next destination, say Vientiane at tour agents (12-hr trip and not 9-hr as what agents are touting, a total of 13 hours including the 1-hour meal time and as quoted as of Feb. 2012 at 150,000 kip for a seating bus and 165,000 kip for a sleeper bus - both include air-con and meals). For seating buses, there is no built-in toilet and so it's advisable to go before the journey as the stop-over at the restaurant is 4 hours away, and the last, the destination station. Check though, because not all tour companies offer free pick-up from a passenger's residence in the quote price. The southern is about 3&#160;km away from the tourist area, and tuk tuk costs about 20,000 kip. The northern bus station is about 5&#160;km.
</p><p>When on a night trip to Vientiane, it is preferable to bring along a neck pillow to lessen the impact of the rough trip.

<ul><li><a href="/en/Nong_Khiaw" title="Nong Khiaw">Nong Khiaw</a> minivans with hotel pickup cost 65.000 kip from agencies. Cheaper (40.000 or 55.000 kip) when purchased directly at the north bus station. Note that boats no longer run from Luang Prabang to Nong Khiaw because of damns on the river.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Chiang_Mai" title="Chiang Mai">Chiang Mai</a> - this new bus direct to Chiang Mai started on 20th January 2012 and costs 1,200 Baht one way. The journey is via Udomxai and Luang Nam Tha before being transported across the Mekong by boat and continuing to Chiang Mai. Total journey time is 18 hours.  From 2013, the bus will use the new Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge from Huay Xai to Chiang Kong and the fare will rise to 1,500 Baht.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Vang_Vieng" title="Vang Vieng">Vang Vieng</a> - the air-conditioned so-called VIP bus costs approx 150,000 kip, and is the same price as the Vientiane bus.  Mini-buses leave from Vang Vieng at 09:00 and cost 100,000 kip. Your guest house should charge no more than 110,000 kip for a minibus pick up directly from the hostel, saving a tuk-tuk to the station. The mini-bus station is just north of the city. As of nov 2016 the minibus station is south of the city. There are two bus stations, if you decides to go on your own you need the one most south/east. The trip takes 6-7 hours (not the 5 that travel agents advertise). Route 13, along which the bus travels, passes through the mountains and twists and turns uncomfortably for most of the journey. This is not a trip to make on a full stomach or if you are feeling queasy.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Vientiane" title="Vientiane">Vientiane</a> - air-con VIP reclining seats bus costs 150,000 kip while air-con VIP sleeper bus costs 165,000 kip if booked through an agent. VIP bus takes 11-12 hours, not the 9-10 hours claimed by many dishonest travel agents. Hotel pickup 1 hour before departure is usually included, but do double-check. Express bus (no aircon) bought at the station is at 110,000 kip. Tickets purchased in Vientiane to Luang Prabang are more expensive than those purchased in Luang Prabang.</li></ul>
<p>The bus follows via routh 13 south is a relentless bumpy ride because the road is curvy and potholed. Comparing pluses and minuses for VIP sleeper/VIP seat to Express for night trips, not much difference. At night there is no need for air-con, and it will be unlikely you can sleep, even on a sleeper bus because of the shaking and rattling as the bus drives along rough, rocky roads. Those prone to motion sickness should know (or better avoid) that this trip travels a winding, mountainous road.
