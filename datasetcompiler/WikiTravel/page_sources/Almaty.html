<p>Almaty is the former capital of Kazakhstan. Still, it remains the financial and cultural centre of the country. It is the most populous and most cosmopolitan city in Kazakhstan. During the last ten years the city experienced regeneration and now offers excellent vacation and winter sports opportunities at a fraction of cost. Almaty is surrounded by fantastic landscapes and beautiful snow-capped mountains. The city remains undiscovered by many tourists and is in the top ten least expensive places to live in the world.

<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.almatyairport.com/">Almaty International Airport</a>, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>ALA</b>), +7 727 270 33 33. Located 25&#160;km from the city centre, it generally takes about 30&#160;min to reach the city centre by car. 
</p><p>The airport is served by a number of airlines: 
</p>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.airastana.com">Air Astana</a> is the national carrier operating to many European and international destinations.</li>

<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.lufthansa.com">Lufthansa</a> connects Almaty with numerous destinations through Frankfurt.</li></ul>
<p>For people from most countries, the easiest way to get to Kazakhstan is by air. Several airlines have regular flights into Almaty, including Lufthansa, CSA, KLM and Turkish Airlines, (twice daily) to name a few. It's roughly a 7-8 hour flight from Europe. Air Astana, with a fairly modern fleet of Airbuses and Boeings, has direct flights from major European cities such as Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, and is a comfortable and reasonably priced alternative to the European airlines. Easy connections from Almaty include <a href="/en/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, <a href="/en/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul </a> Ataturk &amp; Sabiha Gokcen Airports, <a href="/en/Seoul" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>, <a href="/en/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="/en/Delhi" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>, <a href="/en/Tehran" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> IKA and <a href="/en/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a>, <a href="/en/Antalya" title="Antalya">Antalya</a> (summer only), <a href="/en/Bodrum" title="Bodrum">Bodrum</a> (summer only) with direct flights.
</p><p>As of 2015 visas are no longer required for many countries. This means that any old posts about the problems at borders and difficulties with visas are no longer relevant.
</p><p>The airport is small, and sometimes several flights depart around the same time, meaning shocking queues and waits for no apparent reason. Be early, and expect delays to your flight. Lots of departures from Almaty end up leaving a bit late, but most arrivals are pretty timely.
</p><p>A honest taxi from the airport to the city costs about $10-25 (2000-3500KZT.) Unfortunately it is a common scam for drivers to say at the end of the ride that the price given to you at the airport was per KM and not the total price, taking the total up to $100 or even more. If possible, always get your hotel to send you a driver to pick you up otherwise you are at serious risk of being robbed.
</p><p>You can also take a bus to the center, which starts around 5:30AM, the last one being around 10:30PM and costs 80KZT. It is bus #92 and its stop is just in front of the arrivals section. Route #79 also departs from outside the terminal (200-300m away from the terminal itself though and the bus stop is rather creepy) every few minutes and goes to the city center, crosses Jibek Jolly junction with Furmanov street, and takes about 50 to Abay. Though there is a swipe card system now, can still pay with cash to the driver. Buy some thing inside the terminal to get some change. Many ATMs in arrivals hall, cash exchange bureau as well.
</p><p>Note however, that taxi drivers are rather pushy and will ask you continuously to take a taxi instead of public transport.

<p>The best is to ask at the airport information booth to order you a cab (it will be about a 10 minute wait for one to arrive), which they will, and it will cost you half the price of getting one outside the airport (1200KZT). At least, that will be the price quoted to you, the taxi driver may have other ideas. It's a common scam here that at the end of your journey the driver will claim that the 1,200 tenge was per KM, taking the total to about 30,000 tenge. It's tempting, but unwise to argue too much as they turn violent quickly. The safest thing to do is to avoid taking a taxi from the airport - either take the bus , or get your hotel to send you a driver.
</p><p>Check-in desks open around 3 hours before flight departure and you are not permitted into the check-in area until the desks for your flight have opened.

<p>There are two railway stations, Almaty-1 and Almaty-2. Almaty-2 is located in the city centre (300-500 T in a taxi down from the main park area), Almaty-1 is about 4 km from the centre. Most trains end at Almaty-2, but some lower-class trains end at Almaty-1.
</p><p>To get to the city centre from Almaty-2, take tram 5 with stops on Abay St. and costs 80KZT if paying with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://onay.kz/kz">«ONAY» transport card</a> or 100 KZT if paying with cash (June 2017).
</p><p>To Shymkent: There is an overnight train from Almaty 2 to Shymkent for those heading to Tashkent. It leaves at 1807 and arrives at 0850 the next day. With an economy sleeper in a 4 berth cabin with white sheets and TV screens for just under $20US, it is an excellent option. Tickets can be bought from any station.

<p>Sleeper buses leave from Urumqi at 6pm every day of the week except Saturday and take approximately 24 hours to arrive in Almaty (May 2013: daily at 7pm). Tickets for a lower bed are Y420, upper beds are Y400, and a berth in the back bed of the bus is Y380. Buses depart from the international branch of the Nianzigou Bus Station (碾子沟客运站 +86-0991-587-8637 mandarin speaking), which is located about 50 meters to the left of the main Nianzigou station (if facing the front of the station) on the other side of the Wenshabao (温莎堡) building.  Beware that the crossing at Korgas (霍尔果斯) closes on Chinese national holidays (including the first week of October for National Day).
</p><p>Buses also leave from Yining and it takes about 10 hours to go to Almaty. They cost USD 30 or Y150. These buses leave two or three times in a week, ask the busdrives in Yining when they will go. You could also take a bus to Korgas from Yining (public buses from the bus station 19.5 yuan). You can not cross the border on foot!You have to take the minibuses to the kazakh side (1500tenge per person, plus 500tenge if you have luggage). After being on the other side of the border take a taxi to Zharkent for 1000 tenge, than you can catch a taxi to Almaty for 3000 Tenge.Sometimes they ask for 500more at the end, if they have to help you find your hotel in the city. The trip from Korgas to Almaty is about 4 to 6 hours.  The city of Tacheng city (north of Korgas and north of Yining) also has buses that run several times a week to Almaty and back.

<p>Minibuses  and taxis travel to Almaty Sairan station from Bishkek's Western bus station, and cost 400 som for a mini bus (May 2017) and 800 Som for a seat in a taxi, and takes about 3 hours. To get a mini bus enter the station in Bishkek and look for the minibus bay with Almaty written above it. They go when they fill up, so expect to wait about 20 minutes or so after arriving. Just get on and take a seat and payment occurs when the bus is full and about to leave.The taxi will be hanging around outside the station and ifm you say  'Almaty'  someone will point you in the direction of the next taxi leaving. For 100-200 Som extra the driver will usually drop the others at the bus station and take you to you hotel if you have the address and phone number (they usually call the hotel to confirm directions).
</p><p>The trip to the Kazakh border does't take long from Bishkek and when you arrive you must get out and take your luggage through the border crossing yourself. Each passenger and the minibus must clear the border individually, and hopefully he will still be waiting for you on the other side when you complete the ordeal. Unless you individually experience a major delay it is likely the minibus will wait for you.An advantage of the taxi is that they will always wait and indeed the other passengers will often watch out for you. Once through the border crossing, the minibus will stop again after an hour for a rest stop at a gas station.

<p>From inside Sayran avtovogzal   Marshrutkhas go when full to Bishkek west bus station... @May 2016... 1300tenge...pay the driver.
</p><p>In July 2017, 1500KZT for Sayran-&gt;Bishkek, there is/was a ticket booth inside the bus-station building. The tickets are stamped before you get to enter the Marshrutka-platforms.
The Marshrutkas stop twice on the route; one time to get cheaper petrol on Kazakstan side, when only driver leaves the bus. 
Another stop for cafe/water/toilet is some 30mins away from the border on Kazakstan side, for about 15mins.
</p><p>Update July 2017: Counting from the disembarking of the marshrutka on Kazakstan-side, the driver may waits about 60mins until leaving to Bishkek. 
As passengers need to cross the border on foot with luggages, passengers need to find or wait for the marshrutka on the Kyrgyz-side. The meeting place is where its most convenient for the bus to stop after the fences; look where other people are congregated.
NOTE: Write down the numbers in the license plate of the marshrutka. There can be dozens of very similar vans and it's common to distinguish them by the numbers of license plate.

<p>The crossing varies greatly from 1 hour to 5 minutes!! So be prepared and relax. It does seem to be getting better every year.
The border crossing sometimes involves several lengthy, disorganised queues which frequently see large groups of people skipping to the front of the queue claiming young children or infirmity as an excuse. Forget any queuing etiquete and do your best to stand your ground. The border crossing begins with clearing the Kyrgyz immigration. If you're a non Kazakh/Kyrgyz national you simply have to go and present your passport to a man who resides in a room behind a mirrored door at the back of the first building you come across - you can either skip the scrum of people and try to walk around to the back of the building and knock on the mirrored door behind the immigration booths, or you can line up and have the man at the immigration booth point you through to the door.The man will actually come looking for you and pull you out if he is not too busy.
</p><p>Once through the Kyrgyz immigration point you must enter Kazakhstan. You will be handed a form to fill in so maybe apen handy.  At this point on busy days the scrum of people becomes even more intense as you are lined up through a green cage or sorts, although it doesn't seem to apply to everyone as large groups of people will attempt to skip to the head of the queue by waiting outside the end of the green fenced area. Once at the end of the green cage area, there is a larger area where you line up into three queues, one of which is let go at a time into the area with immigration booths. Once into the Kazakh immigration booth area, grab an immigration form and fill it out while you line up at one of the booths. Expect a lot of standing around, pushing, yelling and queue jumping. After the immigration booths, there are customs officers stationed at the exit of the building. They will be randomly letting people through, or searching them, or rejecting them. Locals will be hanging around wondering how to get their stuff through customs. There is no queue. Just go straight to the customs officers and say that you're a tourist and only have clothes in your bag, then they will probably let you through without a search.
</p><p>Update July 2017, both directions of passing the border (Kordai): 
Regardless of citizenship, all people pass through the same booths. 
There are multiple booths on both sides of the border and metal-bars control the  queue-skipping. 
The whole border-crossing happens in a similar fashion as in an (any western) airport. All luggages are x-rayed on the Kazak side when entering from Kyrgyzstan.
No need to find a mirrored door at the back of any building.

<p>It is no longer necessary to register when you enter as long as there are two stamps on the migration card. Anything that is still required is done directly by your hotel who makes a copy of your passport when you check in.

<p>Remember that the mountains outside of town are critical to direction. When someone tells you to head "up", "uptown" or "upper town" they are telling you to head towards the mountains. When someone tells you to head "down", "downtown" or "lower town" they are telling you to head away from the mountains. It is very easy to get around Almaty, since most of the roads are either parallel or orthogonal to each other. The destinations are usually determined by intersections like in <a href="/en/New_York" class="mw-redirect" title="New York">New York</a>. Therefore, for instance, if you know that Kazakhstan Hotel is located in intersection of Abaya street and Dostyk street, local people will be able to help you out with ease.
</p><p>A must have app to download for going around the city is called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.2gis.kz">2GIS</a>. It will give you bus/tram/metro routes from two locations and is available to use offline. Pointing on a bus stop it list all the transport means stopping there along with visualization of their routes on the map. It also has a database of local points of interest that's often better than google and typically works with Russian and English input.

<p>Central Almaty benefits from the new underground system launched on 1 December 2011   <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://metroalmaty.kz/">[2]</a>. It is comprehensive, boasts some great architecture, and is relatively cheap. There is only one metro line consisting of the following <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://alatransit.kz/en/content/metro-stations">stations</a> (Moscow, Sayran, Alatau, Auezov Drama Theatre, Baikonur, Abay, Almaly, Zhibek Zholy and Raiymbek batyr). The first line is still under construction, and when finished it will reach more remote parts of the city. For the summer months it should be chosen without any doubt over the busses/trolleybusses as there is air conditioning inside.
</p><p>As of July 2017, a single trip costs 80 KZT. Payment does not depend on the length of the trip. The one time use <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://alatransit.kz/en/content/payment">jetons</a> (plastic yellow coin tokens aka tickets) are currently sold at manned booths within the stations ("kassa") only and are only valid on the day of purchase. To take the metro, you must go through a metal detector and have your bags x-rayed before entering.
</p><p>There are no day tickets or similar offers tailored to visitors, but for those who do use Metro <i>really</i> often and for an extended period of time, there is a rechargeable unlimited trips smart-card (small refundable deposit is required), which can be recharged for a period up to 3 months. However, if you lose it, you will not get any refund or replacement.
</p><p>The Metro is open from 6am through midnight. The Metro is safe and guarded by police at all times.
</p><p>It should be noted that the trains don't run very often - typically every 15 minutes during the day and 5-7 minutes during rush hour. Stations in the city center are accessible via fairly long escalator rides and further walkways meaning that it might be faster to walk on the street if you only need to go one or two stops.

As of June 2017, the fare is universal – 80 KZT paying cash to driver or conductor on board (change is typically available). Note however that there are heavy traffic jams in Almaty during rush hour (even at 3PM) and moving around with a ground vehicle is not very effective (especially if going to the train station better take the metro or you risk missing your train).
</p><p>Bus rides cost 150 KZT in cash or 80 KZT using an Onay card.

<p>There are both official and informal taxis.  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://alatransit.kz/en/content/taxi">Official taxis</a> can be booked in advance and normally show up quite soon.  The fare difference between official and unofficial taxis may vary up to 3 times.  Just raise your hand and a car will eventually stop.  You should negotiate the price and direction in advance.  Normally the fare varies from KZT200 to KZT5000, depending on the remoteness of the area and the honesty of the driver.  These are really efficient, and although it takes a bit of getting used to, it is the perfect solution to getting around. nevertheless, single travellers should be aware of mugging late at night. Avoid cars with more than one male occupant at night. Usually a car will stop within 30 seconds to 3 minutes of having your hand out. If the driver does not wish to drive to your destination, no problem. The next one will stop a minute or two after. Be careful - if a driver doesn't know where you want to go, they're likely to just drive you around for a bit and drop you off in a random spot rather then admit they don't know where to go and lose your fare. Such drivers also tend to overcharge. There's no real way of telling for sure which drivers are honest in advance, so be aware that if you are taking an informal taxi , you're likely to spend more money and time then you'd expect to  actually get to where you want to go. You will need the name of your destination street and the nearest cross street, in Russian, in order to get to where you want to go. Very few people speak or understand even basic English.  It is necessary to have small money. Usually drivers avoid giving change, so it is better to have the exact amount in hands. 
</p><p>Uber does not work in Almaty, but their partner Yandex Taxi (Y.taxi) operates.  Fares are cheap (you can pay in cash or by card), and the app is available in many different languages.  From the airport to the city centre is less than KZT 2000.  You can choose economy, comfort or business cars.

<p>Almaty is surrounded by mountains and, weather permitting, there is some fantastic hiking. See above for getting to Medeu, from where you can hike, or get the cable car to <a href="/en/Chimbulak" title="Chimbulak">Chimbulak</a>, where you can find good hiking. 
</p><p>There is also good hiking around the Big Almaty Lake area up in the mountains (the lake is at 2,500m and there are peaks overlooking it, some of them above 4,500). The lake and surrounding area are beautiful. The lake freezes in the winter and in the autumn it is a stunning turquoise blue colour. The hiking is also possible in lower altitude. The Areas around 1500-1800 will offer a forest rich in wild fruit and nut trees. The apple tree is native from the Tian Shan mountain. You can find the old Soviet Orchards around.You can reach the area by:
</p>
<ul><li>bus and hike:  goes from the roundabout at Al-Farabi and Navoi up Dulati street and terminates at the last left turn before Almaarasan. This is a good way up towards Big Almaty Lake; the remainder can be done on foot: the hike is about 15km and a 1000m altitude increase (to 2,500m). Follow the road about 8km until you reach a big water pipe, and then follow the water pipe - the first bit is steep but beyond that it gets easier. If you don't take the water pipe the journey is much longer.</li></ul>

<ul><li>bus and taxi: when you get off the 28 bus there are taxis waiting: they will take you up to within 4km of the lake for 2,000 KZT (July 2017) - but you might as well skip the bus (see below).

</p><p>As of 27 July 2022, US$1 equals about 480 Tenge and 1 Euro is 486 Tenge. As a comparison: a Snickers bar is 80 Tenge; a can of Coke is 70 Tenge; a cheese pizza at il Patio is about 1200 Tenge; a cinema ticket for a movie is about 1000 Tenge; a small trip about 10 minutes in length in a taxi - 300-400 Tenge; cigarettes 50-150 Tenge; vodka 500+ Tenge, beer 500ml 120+ Tenge, a litre of juice is around 150 Tenge.

<ul><li>The <b>Green market</b>, or 'Zelyoni Bazaar' in Russian, has fresh vegetables, dairy products, and meat, as well as a number of non-food household items. There is also a good selection of clothes from different countries available. Fruit and vegetables are on the lower level. On the upper level you will find dried fruits, nuts, spices, honey and plants, as well as cheese and meat. The meat section includes horse sausages and is a bit challenging to the nose, so vegetarians beware.The prices increase seasonally, and unless you come from Tokyo or London, you will find it quite expensive, as opposed to your "usual" Asian market shopping experience.</li></ul>

<ul><li>One Saturday a month, there is an 'ad hoc' market on Ablai Khan across from the Tsum. Craftsmen from all over come and sell their wares. It's worth checking out.</li></ul>
<ul><li>In Almaty there is also a market place called Barakholka, which is 4 km long and 20 rows wide and can be seen easily it is a very busy place. You can find virtually anything there, and if the price isn't right, you can easily haggle with the merchants. Want to find a $300 winter coat for about $45? It's possible.</li></ul>
<ul><li>As the city continues to modernize, largest international brands continue to establish stores in the city.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Mend-Al</b> (Mendikulova Street No: 31, Alfarabi Corner). Mend-Al is one of the nice places in Almaty. It serves delicious dishes of Mediterranean, Turkish and European Cuisine. Also serves the sea foods that comes from Istanbul in every two weeks.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bon Appetit</b> (Corner of Timirjazev St and Markov St). Near Five Seasons Hotel. Pleasant restaurant/cafe with English translations in the menu serving wide selection of laghman (noodle dishes) for 650-750T, also salads around 300T and mains.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>La Grenouille</b> (Shevshenko 18, corner with Dostik). Certainly the best french restaurant in town. Friendly atmosphere and tasty food (you should try the frog legs&#160;!) www.lagrenouille.kz</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Emporio Armani Bar</b> (Al-Farabi and Shashkina). Recently opened bar with moderate prices and excellent service. Life DJ and cosy atmposhere.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Gakku</b> (7 Nikitina Street, between Nauryzbay Batyr street and Seyfullin avenue). On of the best restaurant serving Kazakh national food for reasonable prices. One should try "Beshparmak", "Kuyrdak" and other traditional Kazakh dishes. Foreigners are increasingly frequenting this new restaurant. (Western prices, e.g. beshbarmak 3400)</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>The Grill</b> (on top of the hill at Kok Tobe). Take the cable car up, near Hotel kazakhstan on Dostyk. Located in a picturesque setting overlooking Almaty. You are perched over the city on a wooden verandah (some parts nice &amp; shady) and it is an awesome setting. The beers are a bit pricey, but the shashliks are awesome and a few drinks here is a 'must do' experience.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Jantik Club</b> (138 Bogenbay Batyr Street, Shagabutdinov street corner). Western-style bar. Life music and XX century super hits. Beatles fans will be very placed to visit this bar. Residents include Jeraldine Hunt, Oleg Magomayev and Jantemir. Moderate prices.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Queens Pub</b> (Shevchenko and Seifullina). Modern English pub with live bands and evening shows (www.queens.kz).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Sapphire</b>. Late night club and restaurant for the young people. Basic Chinese menu and live DJ with a dance floor. The main drawcard here is the shisha, or 'hubbly bubbly' 'nargile' or 'water pipe'. Other places in Almaty also have shisha (fruit flavoured tobacco, smoked for an hour or two from a hookah), but this is one of the few to use real charcoal and authentic Al Fakher shisha tobacco from UAE. The bar delivers the vodkas pretty promptly too.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Soho</b>. Lunch isn't bad - a buffet with a nice assortment of breads, soups, salads, and main dishes called a "business lunch" at a reasonable fixed price. However the evenings are quite pleasant with live music and reasonable drink prices - no entrance fee during the week. Soho is a great place for a single business man to attend during the night. It is not a very classy joint and is usually packed with Almaty's working woman. Never the less they have one of the best bands in Almaty and they sing in English! Some of their covers are better than the originals, it's a must see event. Try making a booking for a table, to avoid having to stand at the bar.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Taj Mahal</b> (59,Masanchi street, corner of Kababai Batyr Street(Near Celinni cinema),Amaty). This is the most authentic Indian restaurant,with Traditional Hukkah &amp; special pizzas, under new management has started to attract an expat crowd,because of their tradional interior &amp; moe prompt service.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Tau Dastarkhan</b> (halfway up to the mountains). Located in a large area made up of "islands" with Kazakh, Russian, Georgian, and Uzbek kitchens. Not to be missed in the summertime. It's as fun to walk around and see the various settings as it is to eat.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Turandot</b> (two locations: one on Abai between Kosmonaft and Zhandosova attached to the theater building, other on Ablai Khan just below Makataeva). It is a very cheap and very tasty Chinese eatery. Servings are huge, so don't go overboard! There are plenty of vegetarian dishes to choose from, including tofu dishes.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ultra's</b> (Satpaeva between Kosmonaft and Seifulin). Fun restaurant with its own microbrewery on site. It is one of the Staut bars chain. The restaurant has an excellent array of beer, even if it's a little costly.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Zheti Qazyna</b> (Ablai Khan and Makataeva). The restaurant with three kitchens: Uzbek, Asian (ie Chinese), European. The Uzbek room has wonderful wood decorations, blue-tiled kitchen you can see into.</li></ul>

<p>Local foods include:
</p>
<ul><li>Beshbarmak: a traditional Kazakh food that translate as "five fingers" and used to be eaten with the hands. Made from a pile of lasagna-like noodles, topped with pieces of boiled mutton or horse, and boiled onions. Sometimes garnished with carrots and potatoes, depending on who's making it.</li>
<li>Baursaki: heavy, spongy bread dough cooked in deep fat (similar to a donut, but not sweet).</li>
<li>Plov: a rice pilaf made with meat (usually mutton), onions and carrots. This is a very popular dish across central asia and Uzbek Plov is usually considered the best.</li>
<li>Shashlik: (Russian: Шашлык) is a very popular food found across Kazakhstan. It is a kebab made out of almost any kind of meat, but most often chicken, mutton, or beef (although you can find fish, duck and veggie in more upscale places) and is grilled over a small grill that is long and just narrow enough for the skewers. Served with raw, sliced onions and vinegar. Shashlik is popular throughout this part of <a href="/en/Central_Asia" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a> and is best enjoyed in warm weather at small cafes with cheap beer and flat bread.</li>
<li>Doner kebab or "shwarma" can be easily found at any number of stands through the city. Be sure to go to the stands with the most customers, a sign that it is quality and fresh.</li></ul>
<p>Almaty has many modern supermarkets, offering everything from baked goods to toiletries and vodka. Most western foods are readily available. There are four major supermarket chains: Ramstore, SM-Market, Gros and City. And, of course, there are plenty of independent supermarkets and small local minimarts with your basic goods.
</p><p>Ramstore is a Turkish chain and has 11 locations around Almaty according to their website, but is a bit pricier. The favorite stores among locals are Stolichni (Ablai Khan and Kabanbai Batyr) - super helpful staff and decent fruits/vegetables year around, but vegetable prices are very expensive. Dastarkhan (Gogolya Street between Ablai Khan and Furmanova) has excellent baked goods, especially cakes and cookies. Silk Way City (Tole Bi and Nauryzbai Batyr) shopping center has a supermarket in the ground floor.
</p><p>Of course, if you really want to save money and enjoy an adventure, go to the Green Market and bargain with the old ladies. Inside, top floor is more expensive than the lower floor and outside vendors, since space costs more to rent. Inside you can find Korean salads, produce, cheese, honey, meat, and teas/herbs/spices. Outside is much of the same, but often times cheaper. Keep close watch of wallets and phones - backpacks and cameras will make you stand out and a potential target!

<ul><li><b>Water</b>. The municipal water is more or less drinkable, with no real nasties, but try to boil it if possible. Bottled water is cheap and easily available. When at restaurants or cafes, you will most often find Tassay, Asem, or Asu. International brands include Evian, Perrier and Borjomi. Many other widely-known water brands can be found in restaurants and supermarkets.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Tea</b> is widely available and usually served with milk and sugar. If you are on a budget this is the thing to order with your food. Tea is culturally important in Kazakhstan - "chai" time is one of the most important things a visitor can engage in to learn about the culture.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Coffee</b>. Modern coffee houses and western-style cafés are appearing. They serve good coffee. Coffeedelia (Kalinina and Furmanova) is popular with expats and does OK coffee. Gloria Jeans, Marone Rosso, Starbucks and Costa Coffee also can be found. Analogous local chains include Nedelka. Overall, coffee is not nearly as popular as tea and in general, don't expect good coffee at the myriad of cafes around the city.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Kumys</b>. Fermented horse milk, taste and buy on markets. it is the most typical thing to drink in Kazakhstan. Shubat is similar, although not nearly as available, and is made of fermented camel milk.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Tan</b>. Quaint fizzy beverage made of mare's milk.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Local beer</b>. Higher end: Staut, Ultras (formerly Tinkoffs, only served in their restaurant), Line Brew, and Pinta (many locations around the city). Lower end: Tian Shan, Derbes, Irbis, Alma-Ata, Zhigulevskoye. Local brands brewed in Almaty are decent, as are Karagandinskoye (beer from the city of Karaganda).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Local wine</b>. Try if you dare, but local wines are not what they used to be after many crops were destroyed in Gorbachev's campaign to dent alcoholism. Though a decent amount is still produced, it is cheap ($3-4 per bottle) and usually fermented using poor technique and additives. Your best bet for cheaper wines is to try some of the Georgian Wines.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Vodka</b>. Good vodka at $8–10 per bottle. In restaurants that do not usually cater to foreigners you get 20(!) cl if you order a vodka, smaller servings not available. Buy a bottle of "Kazakhstan" vodka to take back. It is in a pretty bottle with a picture of Kazakh hunting with a falcon seen through a "window". Try <b>Edil</b> vodka, which is made with the pantacrene of local deer antlers.</li></ul>

<p>Almaty enjoys a relatively low crime rate and is, generally, a safe place to travel.  Although theft and confidence tricks are common. Be careful of overly friendly strangers or unregistered taxi drivers (you may find two or three at the end of your journey demanding 5 times the agreed value). Use common sense at night, particularly on Friday and Saturday when the youth hit the streets to get drunk and in some unfortunate cases look for trouble. You should abstain from any arguments with locals, otherwise you may end up in the hospital. Kazakh people are extremely friendly and welcoming towards foreigners and nothing should happen to you unless you really want it yourself. If you don't care about them, they don't care about you and nothing should be in your way of having a great holiday! Never try to go to places which you don't trust or don't know about, unless you have a local person with you to help out on the language. 
</p><p><b>Racism</b> is a generally of very minor concern, however if you are of Chinese heritage, you may get some sour looks. The situation is akin to  the US/Mexican racism predicament, where locals feel as though the Chinese are taking their jobs. For the average visitor, however, it is highly unlikely that you will encounter any problems.  You must be always respectful to the country and locals.  In this case, you will feel comfortable with anyone.
</p><p>Police may sometimes round up foreigners and ask for various details, idea is to find someone without his passport, or who has not registered and cough up some cash. They are normally not harmful and after some bickering will let you off. Its advised to keep a copy of your permits/passport with you. They can get serious at times, if you attempt to confront them. A good suggestion is to call up a local friend and ask them to talk to the police.

<p>Center streets such as Furmanov st, Abay st, Zheltoksan st, Dostyk st, Abylay Khan st are strictly regulated and constantly monitored by police officers, while video cameras are installed on 70% of city crossroads. Although there are some Kazakh drivers, who reveal their aggressiveness on the roads. Therefore, it is always better to take great care when crossing the roads.

<p>Practically all establishments accept only Kazakhstan Tenge. Banks are ubiquitous, so exchanging currencies will in most cases not present any major difficulties. Exchange offices (some are open 24/7) are very widespread, which often have good rates and charge no commission. 
</p><p>Credit cards are accepted in major supermarkets, restaurants and bars, but this is usually limited to Visa, Mastercard or American Express.

<ul><li><b>Turgen Gorge</b>.In the National preserve Ile-Alatau in 90 km from Almaty a delightful place of the nature – Turgen Gorge - is situated. In the gorge that has a depth of 44 km. you can take pleasure from visiting hot springs, waterfalls and plenty of forests. Gorge is famous with its waterfalls and relic Chim-Turgen moss fir-woods that spread over the ground and create a dense fir-tree carpet</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Big Almaty Lake</b>. Big Almaty Lake (Bolshoye Almatinskoye Ozero) is one the most admirable mountain lakes of Almaty outskirts, located in Trans-Ili Alatau in the gorge of Bolshaya Almatinka river on the height of 2510 above sea level. It lies in the cavity and is like a sparkling mirror, surrounded from all the sides with majestic peaks. Three main peaks tower over the Lake: Peak of Soviet (4317 m) – in the South-East, Ozerniy (4110) – in the South, Tourist Peak (3954 m) in the South-West. Depending on the season the Lake changes its color from light-green to turquoise-blue. Can be reached by car. Be prepared for the illegal checkpoint just past the Alpine Rose Hotel. Men dressed in camouflage, with no official identification, will cite a dubious "fire danger" sign, even in the middle of winter. They will then try to extort 1,000 to 2,000 Tenge to lift the schlagbaum. Hopefully one day the police will actual confront these criminals and stop the harassment. The permit for the border zone is not needed unless traveling above the lake and on to the observatory.</li></ul>
<p>To get to Big Almaty Lake from Almaty, take bus 28 on the bus stop next to President's park. Go till the very end (till GES-2 - ГЭС-2) and then walk for 10 km. Alternatively, you can take a car next to the pedestrian bridge crossing Sain street. Just cross Sain towards the Park and right on exiting the bridge, you'll find locals forming a "shared cab" to GES-2. If you speak Russian or Kazakh it is 300-400 Tenge.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Alpine park</b>. Outside town, on the road to Chimbulak. Medeu skating rink is on this road too.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Chimbulak</b>. Ski-resort with snowboard and ski tracks. Opened from November till April-May. A base for some great hikes. You can hike up to the top to get a great view of the city. Or you can bypass Chimbulak and carry along the road, past the hotel and walk up to the dam and then the glacier. A tough but beautiful walk. Hiking is definitely a highlight here. To go to Chymbulak, you can take the bus from the corner of Satpayev and Baitursynuly at 8 am every day; don't miss the way back! Every Tuesday is lift out of order.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Charyn Canyon</b>. The second largest canyon in the world. Located 200 km to the east of Almaty. Recommended for tours more than one day. One of the most remarkable nature wonders, left by world ocean is the canyon of Charyn river. Charyn Canyon is considered to be a miniature of the <a href="/en/Grand_Canyon" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> carved by the Colorado River in the U.S. state of Arizona. It is unusual and very diverse in its forms that remind the towers of fairy-tale castle. That is why canyon has another name - the Valley of Castles. On the slopes there could be found the remains of fossil fauna, dated 300 mln years. The canyon has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://eco-park.kz/index_en.html">accomodation and a restaurant</a>, bungalows for 7000 tg/person (2017 sept.), and yurts.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Kolsai Lakes</b>. Lakes of amazing beauty about 250 km away from Almaty. The first lake can be reached by car. To see the other lakes you have to hire a horse for about 500–1000 tenge. You can stay overnight in a small two storey houses for about 2000–5000 tenge per night. The lakes are very clean and you can even drink it. You can see the fish jumping out of it.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Old orchards</b>. The orchards give Almaty its name. Ironically, most have been destroyed in recent, ill-thought out building developments, but a few remain.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Tamgaly</b>. Temple of Sun. In 170 km from Almaty, in the North-West direction, a unique sanctuary in the open air- Tamgaly is located. In the desert lands, where ancient rocks and gorges tower their crowns, a chain of kurgans-burial grounds lie. This is the very place, where a gallery of rock drawings left by ancient people of Saks and Turks tribes could be found. On the petroglyphs you can see deities, that Kazakh ancient people worshiped, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic creatures, spiritual rites.</li></ul>
<p>Nearby <a href="/en/Chimbulak" title="Chimbulak">Chimbulak</a> is a skiing village. There are a number of ski resorts in the area.
</p><p>There are the gorgeous Tian-Shan mountains and lakes around Almaty, the most famous of which is the beautiful Big Almaty Lake. Another popular daytrip destination is through the Medeu Skating Rink and on to the Shymbulak Ski Resort. More experienced hikers can continue on from Shymbulak through <a href="/en/Mynzhilki" title="Mynzhilki">Mynzhilki</a>.  
</p><p>If travelers have several days to spend (and are craving a beach experience), Lake Balkhash, the largest lake in the nation, can be reached by bus within 12 hours or private car within 8 hours. Lake Balkhash is half fresh (the eastern half where the river enters from China) and half salt (the western half).  There are a couple of 2-star hotels in the village of Balkhash, which is the half-way point between Almaty and Astana if you want to drive 800 km instead of flying or taking the train.
</p><p>The Tamgaly petroglyphs, a UNESCO site, are about 2-1/2 hours away by car (on the road to Bishkek).  The petroglyphs range from ancient (3,000 years) to "modern" (75 years), and feature pictures of the Sunman and hunting nomad tribes. There are also several grave sites.  Not to be missed in the spring, summer, or fall, but watch out for snakes when it's hot! Be sure to bring water and snacks in with you from Almaty or a town along the highway, as there are no provisions in or around the park.
</p><p>Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, is a 3-1/2 hour drive away on the best highway in Kazakhstan (pot holes are rare and you can keep a 100km pace easily after leaving the Almaty oblast, but watch out for crazy oncoming passers). You can catch a taxi to Bishkek at "Sayran" international coach station. Approach a group of cars with Kyrgyz number plates and negotiate the price in advance. As of 19 January 2009, the average fare is KZT2,500-3,000 per person.  It is definitely worth the drive if you have a day or so to spend.  You'll wind along the foot of the Tien Shan range through incredible landscape created by young volcanoes.  Most of the "local" felt goods and rugs sold in Almaty come from tribes in Kyrgyzstan, and can be bought for a quarter of the cost in Kyrgyzstan.  Make it into a two-day excursion and stop at Tamgaly petroglyphs on the way from or the return trip to Almaty.
