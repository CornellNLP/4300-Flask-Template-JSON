<p>Manila is distributed into <b>16 territorial districts</b>, which are all original towns except one, the Port Area District. Each district is distinguished through its history, culture and cuisine. 
</p><p>The eight districts of the City of Manila (not to be confused with <a href="/en/Metro_Manila" title="Metro Manila">Metro Manila</a>) north of the Pasig River are:
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Tondo" title="Manila/Tondo">Tondo</a></b> &#8212; The densest, poorest, most dangerous, and undeveloped part of Manila</li>
<li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Binondo" title="Manila/Binondo">Binondo</a></b> &#8212; The world's oldest <b>Chinatown</b> thriving before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1571 and the city's original center for business, finance, and wholesale, as well as retail trade ranging from jewelry to aromatic essences. It's famous for its authentic Chinese, mostly Hong Kong cuisine and quaint interesting Chinese shop-houses. Its church is a fascinating fusion of Spanish Baroque &amp; Chinese styles as shown in its pagoda bell tower.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>San NicolÃ¡s</b> &#8212; shares <b>Divisoria Market</b> (see Tondo) with other co-district is the hub for the adventurous shoppers that may venture for cheap and wholesale bargains.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Santa_Cruz" title="Manila/Santa Cruz">Santa Cruz</a></b> &#8212; is on the edge of <b>Chinatown</b>, which is the district of usual frenzied mix of commercial and residential premises. It's where <b>Escolta</b> starts - the main artery that used to be Manila's old Wall Street and 5th Avenue during the early American Colonial period to the 1960's. <b>Carriedo St.</b> is where a hodge podge of stalls selling locally-made clothes, export overruns, and household items. It is also home to a cultural curio and the second oldest cemetery in the city - the <b>Chinese Cemetery</b>, where the Chinese community's burials were relegated due to restrictions by the colonial Spanish administration. It features palatial mausoleums with hotel-like suites, some with jacuzzis.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Quiapo" title="Manila/Quiapo">Quiapo</a></b> &#8212; Home to <b>Plaza Miranda</b>, Manila's original answer to Trafalgar Square, and most especially to the <b>Black Nazarene</b>, an enduring Catholic icon brought from Mexico in the early 1600s. It is also a place famous for flowers, herbal remedies, love potions, fortune tellers, religious items, as well as electronic goods (Raon St.) to native handicrafts and tourist curios sold at <b>Quinta Market</b> and under an overhead bridge fondly called by some locals as <b>Ille de Toule</b> a French corruption of Tagalog "<i><b>Il</b>alim ng <b>Tul</b>ay</i>" translated in English as "Under the Bridge". Old and delightful Art-Nouveau elite houses are now converted to tumbledown slum enclaves sharing space with B-rated movie houses past their grandeur and glory days. The premier and oldest mosque in the city serves as a centerpiece for Manila's small rendition of Arab &amp; Muslim Town, a concept set up by Imelda Marcos to imbibe some sense of cosmopolitanism in the city.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Sampaloc" title="Manila/Sampaloc">Sampaloc</a></b> &#8212; the word for <i>tamarind</i>, this <b>University Belt</b> district, an easily identifiable nerve center of the country's major institutions of learning and a hotbed of diploma mills, is where the <b>University of Santo Tomas</b>, Asia's oldest university (founded in 1611), famous not more for its notoriously morally bankrupt and corrupt Dominican Friars during the Spanish colonial days as the inspiration portrayed by the National Hero Jose Rizal in his fiction novels, nor for its movers and shakers alumni, but also for being converted into the biggest concentration camp of international civilians held by the Japanese during WWII. Also, it's where lies the <b>Dangwa Flower Market</b>. It is also the student dorm central of the Philippines where most Filipinos nationwide claim temporary board and lodging - in the myriad of apartment houses and ever rising condo-dorms (some as high as forty plus stories) lining a warren of narrow streets - while enrolled in the more than a dozen universities, colleges, and review centers within it, along with service shops such as bookstores, copier &amp; printing (including fake diplomas, identification cards, and certification papers a white collar jobseeker needs) shops, thesis and reports mills, and computer rental shops, as well as entertainment joints catering to a student clientÃ¨le such as internet and video games, bootleg DVD &amp; software shops, billiard halls, and student-budget sex and related vices safe houses. The imposing <b>San Sebastian Church</b>, inside the campus of a university, is the first and only iron pre-fabricated church in the Philippines manufactured in Belgium in the mid 1800s.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/San_Miguel" title="Manila/San Miguel">San Miguel</a></b> &#8212; still part of the <b>University Belt</b> hosting some spillover colleges and universities outside of <b>Sampaloc</b> district, itâs where the <b>MalacaÃ±Ã¡n Palace</b> is located, the official executive seat and residence of the sitting Philippine President as well as museum. It is also the birthplace of the famous and namesake <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=San_Miguel_Beer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="San Miguel Beer (page does not exist)">San Miguel Beer</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Santa Mesa</b> &#8212;  from the Spanish term <i>holy table</i>, this working class district is not so holy anymore as it hosts most of the city's short time love hotels and motels; marks the first shot of the Filipino-American War.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Manila/Port_Area&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Manila/Port Area (page does not exist)">Port Area</a></b> &#8212; the country's chief seaport consisting of North and South Ports, where warehouses are arrayed elbow to elbow along docking and refueling stations for all ships, ferries, and cruise liners, and where one can witness the dramatic sunset of Manila Bay.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Intramuros" title="Manila/Intramuros">Intramuros</a></b> &#8212; taken from the Spanish, <i>intra</i> &amp; <i> muros</i>, literally "within the walls", the <b>History Town of the Philippines</b> and considered as <b>Old Manila</b> itself during Spanish times, just right south of the mouth of the traversing <b>Pasig River</b>. First of all, it is a fortress city used to be surrounded by a moat now transformed into a putting green, and it is where the old Spanish <b>Fort Santiago</b> was headquartered. The fort, converted into a museum, a very historical piece of landmark where almost all the who's who of Philippine colonial resistance - Spanish, American, &amp; Japanese were incarcerated. It used to house a dozen or so churches and congregation mother houses that during clear skies, the skyline was picturesquely lined with cupolas and spires and the morning air was deafening with peeling bells coming from belfries; the finest assembly of colonial architecture, just reduced to ashes with the exception of <b>San AgustÃ­n Church</b> during the last World War. Sir Banister Fletcher, a noted architectural historian wrote <i>"Until...years ago the Philippines could offer many well-preserved examples of Spanish architecture of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Intramuros, the old walled stronghold of Manila, the capital, which was once a treasure-house of <b>ultramarine Hispanic art</b>, suffered irreparable damage during World War II."</i> <i><b>Ultramarine Hispanic Art</b></i>, whatever it was, must have been another lost 8th Wonder of the World which this and future generations have sorely missed. A great plan was under way in the late 70's by Imelda Marcos to reconstruct the old city but since everything else associated with her means opulence and extravagance, it fizzled off. The <b>Manila Cathedral</b> styled as Philippine version of Romanesque-Byzantine Revival, prominently stands within the walls of this district. There is a patch of land east of the walled city informally called <b>Extramuros</b>, the new Civic Centre designated by the Americans where the Classical Revival style <b>Post Office Building</b> majestically visible, built on an imposing spot that should have been used for a more important stately building such as the Classic <b>Senate House</b> sited on a spot where it can only be viewed obliquely and less grandly on a passing glance, and by now demoted as the <b>National Art Gallery</b>, The Art-Deco stylish <b>Metropolitan Theater</b>, and the <b>City Hall</b> with its subdued Mughal-Big Ben style clock tower are situated nearby.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Ermita" title="Manila/Ermita">Ermita</a></b> &#8212; one of the two <b>Tourist Districts</b> (another is the <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Malate_district&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Malate district (page does not exist)">Malate district</a>) south of <b>Intramuros</b>, used to be the one and only <b>Red Light District</b>, bars, pubs, cafes, bistros, night clubs, and massage parloirs, share equal billing (and rent) with most of the city's overseas job recruitment firms, a cosy set up for mostly Middle Eastern employers to unwind after a day's round of interviewing applicants on a business with pleasure trip. It has a lively and diverse nightlife; also offers numerous coin, art and antique, and souvenir shops.  <b>Ermita</b> is also where the <b>American Embassy</b> is located, together with <b>Rizal Park</b>, where the National Hero-Martyr JosÃ© Rizal was executed by firing squad by the Spaniards, now immortalised by his statue-and-obelisk-on-a-pedestal memorial; and also Manila's mini rendition of New York's Central Park, the only biggest lung of the city used as promenade with a dual role as a national mall. The <b>Manila Ocean Park</b>, Manila's answer to Singapore's Sentosa Aquarium is also located in this park complex, as well as the <b>Chinese</b>, <b>Japanese</b>, <b>Filipino</b>, and <b>Artist's</b> <b>Gardens</b>, the <b>Orchidarium</b>, the <b>Open-Air Auditorium</b> hosting the weekly <b>Concert-at-the-Park</b> and foreign film screenings, the <b>Planetarium</b>, and the Classical Revival style <b>National Museum</b> renamed <b>Museum of the Filipino People</b> building as well as the pathetic looking 1950's style <b>National Library</b>. At the east end of the Park is where used to be <b>Wallace Field</b> where the American-style Mardi Gras festival <b>Manila Carnival</b> was yearly held for 32 years until it was abruptly ended by World War II.  Around and nearby is where one can also find the grand <b>Manila Hotel</b>, one of the finest hotels in the Far East, dusty outside due to air pollution. And much farther down a few blocks south is the <b>Supreme Court</b> building back to back with the equally Greek/Roman Classical styled campus of the Manila branch of the premier state university, the <b>University of the Philippines</b> (and its signature welcoming cruciform figure, the Oblation), which location is the very first campus of the University built around 1900 before it was transferred to QuezÃ³n City after World War II.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Malate" title="Manila/Malate">Malate</a></b> &#8212; just right south of <b>Ermita</b>, an equally very colourful hotel district, used to be famous for its mansions where the city's cream of the crop resides and its elite girls convent schools as well as the <b>De La Salle University</b>, which started as an elite boys school now transformed into a learning center of choice for the country's Chinese elite class. Malate is now more known as the center of bohemian night life in the city and the whole metropolis. Also, the site of the fiercest atrocity done by the Japanese to any civilians at the closing of World War II where whole neighbourhoods were forced to assemble in the nearby <b>Rizal Memorial Sports Coliseum</b> to be dealt with mass orgy of rape and massacre. The district has a quaint and handsome Philippine-Baroque style church. The <b>Manila Zoo</b>, Asia's oldest zoo and, together with the title, is probably the most haggard looking.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Imelda Marcos' dreamy City by the Bay called the <b>Cultural Centre of the Philippines Complex</b> or <b>CCP Complex</b> for short, a flat extended open space reclaimed from the bay that resembles Beijing's Tienanmen or Moscow's Red Square lined with coconut palm trees, as Civic Center and breezily tropical as it gets and an inspiration for Singapore's Marina, is bannered by the zen-like and boxy <b>Cultural Centre of the Philippines</b> - home for national theatrical performances, co-inaugurated by then Marcos buddy and Governor Ronald Reagan. Designed by Leandro Locsin, King Bolkiah of Brunei and Imelda's favorite architect, in the mold of Oscar Niemeyer and Meis Van Der Rohe, this travertine veneered masterpiece is typical of those "less is more" fancies of the 1960's-70's. Other similar structures in the vicinity designed by him are the <b>Philippine International Convention Centre</b>, the <b>National Design Centre</b>, a supporting institution for the growth of industrial design arts, the <b>Folk Arts Theater</b>, built specifically to host the 1974 Miss Universe Pageant, and the sharp and still spiffy Philippine Plaza Hotel. Most are now in their not-so-pristinely-intended condition. The two other important landmarks in the complex not designed by him is the said to be haunted <b>Manila Film Centre</b>, the venue for the first and only Manila International Film Festival which premiered the film "Gandhi" in 1982, now the repository <b>National Film Archives</b>, and the architecturally intriguing, humble and yet tasteful <b>Coconut Palace</b> now as the <b>Office of the Vice President of the Philippines</b>. The last important structure here is the <b>GSIS Building</b> or the Government Service Insurance System, meant as the social security apparatus of government workers with the <b>Banawe Rice Terraces</b> concept in mind, also architecturally engaging, now temporarily housing the <b>National Senate</b>, the senior legislative arm of the government. Although technically contiguous, these landmarks, except for the Cultural Center, are not part of the district anymore and belong to the city of Pasay.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Manila/Pandacan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Manila/Pandacan (page does not exist)">Pandacan</a></b> &#8212; district home to many of the country's literary and musical geniuses, originally named after the pandan plant species.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Manila/Paco" title="Manila/Paco">Paco</a></b> &#8212; a working class district that started out as <b>Little Tokyo</b> during the Spanish era, lies the city's historic but ruined and abandoned <b>Paco Train Station</b> where overhead, Japanese and American planes combated in a dogfight showdown after the Pearl Harbor attacks and the run-up to the invasion of Manila by the Japanese. It's also the location of the mysterious circular cemetery now simply called <b>Paco Park</b>, the first burial site of the national hero - Jose Rizal, after he was executed by the Spanish, now used as venue for chamber music symphony concerts. <b>Paco Market</b>, another of the city's major wet-dry public market, has one of the most frenzied, colorful, and interesting market scenes in the city with it's boisterous itinerant vendors, busy Chinese owned stalls, and hawker market food. The district specializes in furniture and hardware items.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Manila/Santa_Ana&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Manila/Santa Ana (page does not exist)">Santa Ana</a></b>&#8212; known as <i>Sapa</i> in ancient times, this district is the old capital of <b>Namayan Kingdom</b> which is the precursor of modern Metro Manila and used to be a quiet upmarket residential neighborhood comparable to Chelsea district in London during the American colonial era, but now a blighted working class district with its defunct <b>Santa Ana Hippodrome</b> (located in next door Makati City which used to be suburbia), once, one of the finest horse racetracks in Asia, now bought by Ayala Corporation and is now being converted and developed as another of their signature mixed commercial-residential development projects. A small museum by the colonial church of Our Lady of the Abandoned or simply <b>Santa Ana Church</b>, shows remnants of a pre-Spanish settlement.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Manila/San_Andr%C3%A9s_Bukid&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Manila/San AndrÃ©s Bukid (page does not exist)">San Andres Bukid</a></b> &#8212; also known as St. Andrew Fields in English, was previously part of <b>Santa Ana</b>.

<p>For over three centuries Manila was colonised and administered by <a href="/en/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> which left an enduring architectural heritage throughout the Philippines, especially with respect to churches, forts and other colonial buildings which can still be seen in the ruins of Intramuros, built in the late 16th century. Manila began as a settlement on the banks of the Pasig River, and its name originates from "Maynilad," referring to the mangrove plant known as Nilad, which was abundant in the area. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, Manila was home to Muslim-Malays, who were descended from the Arabs, Indians, East Asians and other Southeast Asians. In 1571, 50 years after Magellan's discovery of the islands, Spanish conquistador Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi claimed the Philippines as a colony and established Manila as its capital. Manila was also briefly colonised by the British for two years.  Manila was also part of the Spanish East Indies until 1898, when the U.S. took over the Philippines after the Spanish-American War.
</p><p>Manila was first sought by the Spaniards, then the Americans. The Spaniards wanted a counterbalance to the expanding Portuguese empire which had almost taken a big slice of the pie in the lucrative Spice Trade. They got it through Manila, so strategically placed between China together with the rest of Asia, and Mexico - the next closest transit point for goods onwards from Asia to Europe.
</p><p>Its location seemed a well thought out choice. Legazpi took five years after arriving in the Philippines and settling in CebÃº in 1565 to mull over before deciding to finally move up north to Manila in 1571 and make it the capital of the new territory. By numbers, it shortened the travelling distance to the other side of the empire in Acapulco. Manila is also in a much easy and straighter drafting reach for sailing ships to catch the Pacific Trade Winds as it blow northeastward to Japan for Acapulco and blow precisely at San Bernardino Strait for the westward-bound return trip without being diverted any farther. Most importantly, Manila is much closer than CebÃº to China. 
</p><p>When Mexico pushed for its independence from Spain and finally shoved her out, the Philippines' glittering importance began to dwindle due to the discontinuance of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade, cutting off the Acapulco to Vera Cruz segment. It accelerated more when the Suez Canal was opened enabling the Chinese exports to go opposite direction and making Singapore as most important transit hub to Europe in the region. A token administration was just maintained in Manila which confined it to the doldrums, being one of the unreachable and hard to maintain colonies of Spain. Until a new imperialist era dawned, emboldened countries embarked on a new competition for raw materials and market.
</p><p>The Netherlands, Britain, and France were already there now with Germany, lurking somewhere and fit to fill in the void about to be vacated by waning superpowers. Germany was already sniffing its way around the Pacific Ocean like a shark smelling a kill when the US, spurred by the windfall of acquiring Hawaii and which desperately wanted a toehold in Asia for her trade, notably with Japan and China, grabbed the first opportunity of coveting the Philippines. The Philippines once more, so strategically placed as the soon-to-be-linchpin of American imperialism extended her colonial servitude to the US.
</p><p>Being a city with its ears and antennae acutely tuned in to American and some European trends, and in the forefront of modernisation and constant cultural refinement, Manila witnessed or hosted innovations - political, cultural, civic etc. more than any other city in Southeast Asia or Asia as a whole.

<p>Manila sits on an archipelago just at the edge of the Asian continent, some 14Â° 35' N, 121Âº 00 E'. Itâs 700 miles (1,100 km.) or 2 hours flight time from Hong Kong, 1,400 miles (2,200 km.) or 3:15 hours from Bangkok, 1,500 miles (2,400 km) or 3:35 hours from Kuala Lumpur/Singapore, 1,900 miles (3.000 km) or 4:15 hours from Tokyo, and 1,800 miles (2,800 km.) from 4:25 hours from Beijing. 
</p><p>Ever so physically endowed, it is sitting in the throes of two notoriously dangerous volcanoes - Pinatubo to the north, which made headlines in 1991 when it spewed dust all over the world and dropped global temperature by 2Â°, and Taal to the south which always makes headlines every decade or so, while this city straddles the Pacific Rim of Fire underneath. What more, it lies in the path of the tropical monsoon bringing those more and more powerful typhoons during the second half of the year. It is fringed to the south by the idyllic Lake Bai - a veritable scenic showcase of Hispanized native folk and traditional culture, and farther south by cool and refreshing Lake Taal.
</p><p>The City of Manila is in the western part of Metro Manila. It is bordered on the west by Manila Bay, to the north by <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Navotas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Navotas (page does not exist)">Navotas</a>, <a href="/en/Quezon_City" title="Quezon City">Quezon City</a> and <a href="/en/Caloocan_City" class="mw-redirect" title="Caloocan City">Caloocan City</a>, to the east by San Juan and <a href="/en/Mandaluyong_City" class="mw-redirect" title="Mandaluyong City">Mandaluyong City</a> and to the south by <a href="/en/Pasay" title="Pasay">Pasay</a> and <a href="/en/Makati" title="Makati">Makati</a>.

<p>Manila has a tropical savannah climate and along with the rest of the <a href="/en/Phillipines" class="mw-redirect" title="Phillipines">Phillipines</a> lies entirely within the tropics. This means that the city experiences very small seasonal variations, while humidity persists year-round (74% on average). In fact, there is only 4Â°C (7Â°F) difference between the average temperatures in January and May, the coolest and hottest month prespectively. Temperatures have never fallen below 14Â°C (57Â°F), or risen above 38Â°C (100Â°F). The city also features a distinct wet (May-November) and dry season (December-April). Typhoons are also common from June to September.

<p>The PhilippinesÂ´ primary international airport. Terminals 1, 2, 3, 4, are not internally-connected, and require an actual drive through the crowded city streets in taxis or jeepneys.  <b>Allow lots of time for connection.</b>  Better yet, book your flights on 1 reservation so you are "protected" with continuity. See guide here for connection logistics and times: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.silent-gardens.com/air-transfer.php">http://www.silent-gardens.com/air-transfer.php</a>
</p><p>Update: There is currently free bus transfer service from Terminal 4 to Terminal 1 (and possibly to other terminals) if you are making a connection. The bus goes within the airport, so it does not get stuck in traffic (travel time ~10 minutes, waited 30 minutes for a bus). From Terminal 4, inquire inside near the baggage claim.
</p><p><b>Terminal 1</b> is used for most international flights.
</p><p><b>Terminal 2</b> is used exclusively by Philippine Airlines.  
</p><p><b>Terminal 3</b> is used by domestic carriers like Cebu Pacific and now includes several international airlines.
</p><p><b>Terminal 4</b> is used by budget carriers AirAsia and Air Swift.
</p><p>The terminal fee for domestic flights originating from Manila is now included into the ticket price, and is not charged at the airport anymore. The PHP500 terminal fee for international departures is now also included in the ticket price.
</p><p>There are buses outside the arrival area heading to downtown Makati City and QuezÃ³n City via EDSA or Efipanio de Los Santos Ave..
</p><p>Airport metered taxis are colored yellow, and have the right to stop and pick up passengers and line up the porte cochere area as you step out of the arrival hall. Each departing taxi is registered by a dispatcher. Despite this, there have been frequent scams (accelerated meters, charging full days' mileage, etc).  <b>Do not let the yellow taxi driver retain both taxi slips</b>. You should not need to pay more than â±250 to most hotels in the city. Keep an eye on the meter at all times.
</p><p>White taxis are warned as "not officially sanctioned" by NAIA, but often times are much more honest and cheaper.  Base fare start at â±40.  But they can only be caught in the departure level, where they are dropping off departing passengers.
</p><p>Clark airport 2 hours North of the city has a direct bus connection (450 pesos) to the city centre area.
</p><p>Other than taxis there are buses and jeepneys (small buses) that will take you places for much less than taxis (around 15 pesos). Most of them connect to the a train line which is just as cheap as the buses but could get very crowded during the rush hours. Some buses/jeepneys will drive down the ESDA road and makes a lot of the city accessible in one bus. The train stations of Taft Avenue/Pasay/EDSA Stations are a cluster of separated and confusing platforms or stations in the same area with unclear links - ask the locals if not sure where to go. Around here its also possible to catch buses and jeepneys to the various airport terminal. Seek helpful locals. See the airports voyage page for more detailed info. One word of warning as the jeepneys, buses and especially trains are jam packed and pick pockets are very likely. Protect your valuables and luggage well and remember you will be very tightly squeezed so moving your bag will be difficult. Exercise tough love and imagine that you are at one side of the train and the doors you need to exit by are on the other side.
</p><p>Under Philippine customsÂ´ regulation, for all residents and non-residents, each person may only up to PHP50,000 through the customs. Exceeding amounts require authorisation from the Central Bank of the Philippines. Foreign currencies: up to USD10,000 or its equivalent, the larger amounts must be declared.
400 cigarettes OR 250g of rolling tobacco OR 50 cigars.
2 bottles of alcoholic spirit, no more than 1 litre per bottle.

<p>Manila is the hub of the Philippine ferry network, and ferries to most major cities will stop at the <b>Manila South Harbor</b>, the city's main passenger seaport.  Several companies operate ferries to Manila from points throughout the Philippines, and cruise ships occasionally stop in Manila throughout the year.
Around the capital are numerous attractions for people desiring a quick daytrip away from the hustle and bustle of this mega-metropolis.

<p>Although there are more than 170 indigenous languages in daily use, the most widely understood and, alongside English, one of two official languages, the language of Manila is <a href="/en/Filipino_phrasebook" title="Filipino phrasebook">Filipino</a> and it is commonly spoken in many homes. Filipino is almost completely based on Tagalog and may be viewed as a prestige register of it.
</p><p>English is also widely spoken in Manila as well. English is the language of the government and the preferred choice for formal written communications, be it in school or business. Tourists who have just arrived here can easily catch up with the latest gossip news in the local tinsel town, as well as government scuttlebutts, as there are plenty of English version newspapers and magazines.
</p><p>In <a href="/en/Manila/Binondo" title="Manila/Binondo">Binondo</a>, Manila's Chinatown district, Hokkien is widely spoken while Mandarin might also be known as it is taught in Chinese educational institutions. It is fast becoming the third most important language following Filipino and English, unseating Spanish.
</p><p>Spanish used to be the official language of the Philippines and gradually became the language of the old time generations; at one time it used to be taught for a 12-unit course in all university curriculi. A tertiary education is not complete unless one takes the whole course and must at least have basic conversation skills. Now, Spanish is hardly spoken in the Philippines, but the language has somehow percolated through the Filipino vocabulary.  
</p><p>Manila's economic growth has attracted people from provinces with a delusion that a better life can be attained in the city. These people had brought a diversity in Manila's culture from their home towns with tongues that speak Ilocano from the Ilocos regions, Pampango from Pampanga, Bicolano from the Bicol Region, Hiligaynon from Western Visayas, Cebuano from Cebu and Waray from Leyte and Samar. 
</p><p><b>Taglish</b> has been part of everyday life of Manilans as they try to grapple with expressing themselves the easiest and the most effective way, mix n' matching English words and phrases with Tagalog and vice versa. It used to be frowned upon by teachers but as the quality of education deteriorates, they too found themselves committing the same act since this new wave of teachers are also a product of the newer generation.
</p><p>The assault on purists comes both ways, those who have inadequate schooling in English at lost for words, and on the other side, those specifically bred and schooled in the US establishing their foothold back in the country struggling with their broken Tagalog; or finding experiences that can't be expressed in Tagalog, throwing in some English words as filler. It so happened that being "foreign", "western", and "American", they are more endeared and adorable to the grounded natives, their way of speaking becoming the "in" thing. Also, English being at the forefront of technological and cultural development produces new words and experiences that can't be purely translated.
</p><p>Movie personalities being role models are more of the culprits as they magnify the popularity of Taglish (Tagalog and English combined).

<p>Manila is crossed by four lines of the <b>Strong Republic Transit System</b> (SRTS), Metro Manila's (partially) integrated railway network.  The LRT 1 and LRT 2 lines, operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority, cross through Manila city proper, converging at the intersection of Rizal Avenue and C.M. Recto Avenue.

<p>Several city and provincial bus routes either cross through or terminate in Manila.  Most buses which serve Manila proper will cross through the Lawton bus terminal, which is conveniently located in front of the LRT-1 Central Terminal station.  Routes include points in Metro Manila, Laguna, <a href="/en/Cavite" title="Cavite">Cavite</a> and <a href="/en/Bulacan" title="Bulacan">Bulacan</a>, and bus fares normally begin at â±12.
</p><p>Manila city bus routes are <b>not</b> numbered.  However, the bus route is prominently displayed on the side of the bus as well as on the dashboard, listing both the route's endpoints and major points in between which will be served by that particular route.

<p>Tricycles and pedicabs are, in the City of Manila, limited to short distances as it can access hard-to-reach areas.  Tricycle and pedicab terminals are found throughout the city: major points for taking tricycles and pedicabs within the downtown area include the Lawton bus terminal, the area around LRT-1 Doroteo Jose and MRT-2 Recto Stations, Tutuban railway station, Plaza Lacson in Santa Cruz, and Plaza Lorenzo Ruiz in Binondo.  Tricycle and pedicab terminals are normally located alongside jeepney terminals and train stations.
</p><p>By law, tricycles and pedicabs must display a fare matrix which displays fares to areas served by the vehicle, and is normally adhered to for short distances.  For longer distances, it is not uncommon to negotiate the fare beforehand with the driver.

<p>In Ermita, Intramuros and Binondo, it is still possible to ride a <i>calesa</i>, or traditional horse-drawn carriage.  While no longer used as a meaningful form of transport by most locals, calesas are useful for navigating through narrow streets (similar to tricycles and pedicabs), as well as getting a feel of transport in colonial Manila.  Fares are negotiated beforehand with the <i>cochero</i> (driver), and a one-hour ride for two people normally costs around â±50-70.
SCAM ALERT: Be aware of the well known calesa scam. When you ride, they will just say 50 or so Pisos but while hopping off they'll ask for 50 US dollars.

<ul><li><b>Rizal Park</b> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizal_Park">[4]</a> Right outside the walled city is Rizal Park more widely known as the <b>Luneta</b>.  The Luneta is the venue for the national museums, bayside restaurants, an open-air theater featuring free classical music concerts and acclaimed international films, a planetarium, an open gym for early morning jogging and tai chi enthusiasts, or a night ballroom, as well as Japanese, Chinese, Filipino gardens, an orchidarium, an aquarium, and a children's museum. It is a popular meeting spot for family picnics and lovers' trysts, and was the site of the execution of JosÃ© Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, and where a monument and final resting place most importantly - but sadly and disrespectfully overshadowed by poking skyscrapers nearby - is erected, as well as the inaugural grandstand for the incoming President.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Paco Park</b> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_Park">[5]</a>was actually built as a final resting place for Spanish families residing in Manila. After JosÃ© Rizal's execution, his remains were sent and buried here, which is today commemorated by a monument in the park. It is now a public park with jogging lanes and open air concerts, and is also a popular venue for weddings.  It is accessible by taxi and bus, as well as a 10 minute walk from the LRT-1 United Nations Ave. station.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Manila Zoo</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.manila.gov.ph/manilazoo.htm">[6]</a>is rather decrepit, and in need of drastic renovations. The Manila Zoo covers an area of 0.055 square kilometres. Accessible via LRT-1 Quirino station. Also here is housed its famous occupant, the lonely elephant Mali, the Philippines' only living elephant, known and friend, but not intimately, to Hollywood stars such as Sir Paul McCartney &amp; Pamela Anderson who have yet to personally inspect her condition and 'solitary confinement'.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Manila Ocean Park</b> is a much better maintained marine wildlife facility which was recently opened in 2008 and is located behind the Quirino Grandstand at Rizal Park.  The 8000 square metres (86,000 sq ft) oceanarium is larger than the Sentosa Underwater World oceanarium in Singapore, and features a 25 metres (82 ft) underwater acrylic tunnel.  Mostly accessible by taxi, but can be walked if you are in the vicinity of Rizal Park.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Arroceros Forest Park</b> Situated in the heart of downtown Manila, Arroceros Forest Park is a 2.2-hectare piece of land behind the old art deco Metropolitan Theatre.   Arroceros got its name, which means ârice dealers,â from the rice trade along the Pasig riverbank during the early colonial period.</li></ul>

<p>Baroque colonial churches where once proud showcases of the past especially before World War II but the wanton destruction of the Japanese and the equally guilty American soldiers during the Battle of Manila in 1945 dissolved all that except for a handful remaining. Lack of maintenance, vandalism, theft, and no proper awareness, guidance, or education by administering priests and architects who undertook renovation blunders (multiplied more incidents in the provinces) complicated the already pathetic state of remaining churches.

The materials were ordered from Europe while the architect is Gustav Eiffel; the architect of the Eiffel tower in France. Its Gothic architecture might make you think you're somewhere in the middle of Europe.</li></ul>

<p>Aside from the interesting Spanish Colonial Churches, there is one group of church-structures belonging to the <b>Iglesia ni Cristo</b>, a homegrown reformist church established by a ManileÃ±o named FÃ©lix Manalo in 1914 that is uniquely Filipino somewhat parallels with the Latter-Day-Saints (Mormons), that merit some curiosities. These unique churches have two outstanding features: that they are kept in pristine white condition (with some little colour highlights), and they soar to the sky like those gothic cathedrals, or Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, or the Salt Lake Temple in Utah. In some cases, they jot out in the middle of a green countryside off the suburbs of Metro Manila. But even in the midst of urban jungle in Manila, one can't help but notice its towers and spires projecting through the clouds among the busy skyline.
</p><p>No name yet is given to this architectural style but it may safely be called Philippine Gothic Revival and the churches show the usual suspects of Gothic tracery, lacework, and rosettas, with the emphasis of verticality and noticeable indigenous geometric motifs as substitute. 
</p><p>Its "Vatican" is located in the New Era District of Quezon City and can be easily seen from about two to three miles away from all directions heralding in a Cinderella-like castle fashion, their main shrine and headquarters.

<p>Manilans are mostly very pious Catholic people. On a different angle, being afflicted with problems and ailments, Manilans may not have much alternative and feel that some things are just out of their control and the best way is to ask for answers and solutions to their favorite saints. It would be interesting to note that some streets leading to a patron saint's home church are extra tight during their special days.
</p><p>For the anthropologically curious, it also provides a good peek into the daily life of the locals, young and old, men or women. It alo reveals a facet trait of the Filipino - being fatalistic and true blue believer of some higher spirits.
</p>
<ul><li><b>St. Jude Thaddeus Shrine</b>, San Miguel District, Manila - Near MalacaÃ±Ã¡n Palace, this church is the busiest on Thursdays.</li>
<li><b>Our Lady of Perpetual Help Shrine</b>, Not in the City of Manila but situated in Baclaran District of Pasay City. Nevertheless heavy traffic affects the southern portion of the city towards the cities of Pasay-ParaÃ±aque, all interconnected by the LRT-1. This Church is the liveliest on Wednesdays much more especially so because the surrounding area is carpeted by a flea market.</li>
<li><b>The Black Nazarene Minor Basilica</b>, Quiapo District, Manila - Its feast day is on 9 January but its special day of the week falls on Fridays.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Intramuros Tour</b> - visit the Walled City starting from Fort Santiago. Inside is the Rizal Shrine, honoring the country's National Hero, Jose Rizal - polymath, doctor, engineer, scientist, artist, linguist, propagandist, and most of all, an avid traveler who was incarcerated in exactly that same cell before he was executed, now transformed into his shrine. His patriotism and nationalist advocacy preceded that of Mahatma Gandhi's by about 20 years. His shrine houses his memorabilia. Other places to see are the Plaza Mayor, Plaza de Roma, Ayuntamiento, Palacio del Gobernador, and the Manila Cathedral. San Agustin Church needs more than a passing glance. The monastery-church complex houses priceless collection of religious art. Across is Plaza San Luis Complex comprising a group of houses replete with authentic furnishings of the colonial period. Trace the walls of the city and the interestingly unique gates of the walls, eight in all and stopping at Parian Gate, the gate leading to Bahay Tsinoy, meaning House of the Filipino-Chinese, Philippines' version of the Peranakan House-Museums in Singapore and Malacca. The House-Museum extolls also the economic, political, and cultural, among other things, from the humble beginnings to, achievements and contributions of the Filipino-Chinese community.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Rizal Park Tour</b> - Designed by Daniel Burnham, this park is the Philippines' answer to Paris' Jardin des Tuileries or Washington Mall. Gaze at Rizal Monument, a must stopping point for Heads of State visits, the Japanese &amp; Chinese Gardens, the National Museum, the Planetarium, the Ocean Park, the Museo Pambata, as well as the Quirino Grandstand, the oath-taking stand for Presidential inaugurations.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Downtown Manila Tour</b> - This self-guided tour starts at Bahay Nakpil on Bautista St. in Quiapo, on a turn-of-the-century house, then to Plaza Miranda, now teeming with vendors of religious, herbal merchandizes, as well as fortune tellers and prayer proxies as you make your way to the Quiapo Basilica housing the Black Nazarene. Stroll to Raon, Villalobos, and Palanca Sts. on your way to Quinta Market and the Ile de Toule (Ilalim ng Tulay) for handicrafts and souvenirs. Pass by Carriedo and Juan Luna Sts. another commercial strips towards Chinatown at Binondo where it ends in Binondo Church, the heart of town.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Malate &amp; Ermita Tour</b> - Cover this area starting from Plaza Rajah Sulayman and Malate Church, a quiant baroque church, then meander in any direction along Adriatico, Mabini, Del Pilar Sts., and Roxas Blvd. Make sure to stop at San Andres Market.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>CCP Complex Tour</b> - Probe into the mind of Imelda Marcos by strolling, jogging, or biking into the reclaimed CCP Complex where a menagerie of her showcase art-beauty-culture projects stands, albeit not in its spic-n'-span condition. See <b>Districts/Malate'</b> and <b>Understand</b> sections. These public buildings except for the Cultural Center Building or Theater for the Performing Arts, used to be accesible but have now been reduced to being admired from the outside. The Coconut Palace, always unpredictably closed, is now open for viewing, albeit by appointment.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Skyscraper Gazing Tour</b> - Outside of the City of Manila, get a hands on experience of the modern city with four greatest and latest skyscraper showcases of the metropolis starting via LRT-1 to MRT-3 stopping at Ayala Center in Makati, the oldest at 50 plus years and kept on re-inventing itself. Step into Ayala Avenue, the new Fifth Avenue of the Philippines and walk breezily in its 5-meter wide, flat, and very feet-friendly sidewalks (a rarity in Manila) while gazing at the ever becoming higher and higher skyscrapers. The walking tour heads to Ayala Triangle - a mini park spotted with sprawling acacia trees and a green carpet of turf, home to the Makati and Philippine Stock Exchanges buildings. The vertices of the triangle-park are highlighted by significant Filipino heroes. On the South vertex and first approach is the image of the fiery and enraging female heroine-on-horseback of the Spanish Revolt - Gabriela Silang, on the North vertex, the hubris-full and regal posing Muslim Sultan Kudarat, and on the East vertex, the meek and helpless nerd-looking assassinated hero, Ninoy Aquino. Trace back towards EDSA and switch to another mode of transport, a taxi or on an AUV in order to get to the second major destination, the BGC or Bonifacio Global City, then back again to EDSA, on the way skirting through the third cluster of skyscrapers in an area called the Rockwell Center, then finally to EDSA at MRT-3 Guadalupe Station. The line to the north heads to another concentration of skyscrapers, the Ortigas Center, the last end of the tour. There are alternative routes connecting these four. As you go along, you will be arching back your neck and staring upwards. Manila has seen another period of construction boom in practically the busiest areas in the metropolis (and these areas are just a sample) with an upward sales growth of condominium units). Be discreet on taking photos. Just like in traumatized New York or Los Angeles, here in Manila, skyscrapers and camera equals trouble. People here are not used to seeing a lot of tourists and mostly will have some second thoughts why you are doing this thing, unless you are white.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Electric Chariots Tour of Intramuros</b> - tour in style, meaning in segway rented from White Knight Hotel, Intramuros.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>City Tour of Metro Manila Via train</b> - This do-it-yourself tour provides a panoramic view of the city from a different vantage point, exactly from a moving elevated train about 15 feet above street level. It comes in three lines - Line-1 (Yellow) for the North to South Route which is mostly within the City of Manila, Line-2 (Purple) for the East to West Route, a quarter of which is in the City of Manila, and Line-3 (Blue) for the circumferencial route, totally out of the city.

<p>The unit of currency is the <b>Peso</b> (symbol: <b>â±</b>), and judging by the impressive performance of the economy and its big foreign currency reserves, the peso is at US$1 to â±57 and dollar is sliding up. Bill denominations are in â±20, â±50, â±100, â±200, â±500, &amp; â±1000 while coin denominations are in 25Â¢, â±1, â±5, &amp; â±10. 25Â¢ has always been very common and the jeepney fare has increased to a base fare of â±12.00 (december 2022).
</p><p>Banks and exchange offices are available in the airport and surprisingly, they offer better rates than the numerous money changers elsewhere around town. There is no commission. Most regular banks outside the airport will only change foreign currency for their own customers so you will probably be forced to use a money changer. The farther it is from the Tourist Belt Area, and the nearer it is around a town or city public market, the better the exchange rate is. Safety is not a problem especially if you change them during busy hours (safety in numbers). Be sure to count everything and put them safe in your person before you leave the premises.
</p><p>Money can be withdrawn from ATM and they are also everywhere. The Philippines are one of the countries with the most available ATM machines per capita. there is a 200-250 fee to use ATMs for overseas cards. <b>The only ATMs with out the 200-250 fee is HSBC</b>.
</p><p>Credit Cards are accepted almost everywhere especially at all upmarket shops.
</p><p>A part of the Philippine's bustling capital is a remarkable melting pot of Asian, Oceanic, and Latin cultures, which are thick with history and flavor in tune with most traveler's interests. The best way to get a feel for Manila shopping is to go to a âtianggeâ, a market of stalls where everything can be bargained. Market! Market!, <b>St. Francis Square</b>, <b>Greenhills Shopping Center</b> and <b>Tiendesitas</b> in <b>Pasig City</b> are examples of such. There are shopping centers catering to handicrafts, antiques, and curio souvenirs. Aside from <b>Ilalim ng Tulay</b> in <b>Quiapo</b> are the shops in the districts of <b>Ermita</b> and <b>Malate</b> around <b>M. Adriatico</b>, <b>A.Mabini</b>, and <b>M.H. del Pilar</b>.
</p><p>If you are interested in a Western-type mall, you cannot pass <b>SM Mall of Asia</b>, currently the 4th largest mall in the world. Warning to shopaholics and their spouses:  You could spend a day there and still not see every shop or have to time to ice skate. That's right, there is an ice rink as well.
</p><p>Manilans, or Filipinos in general are avid mallers, the Philippines outranking affluent Thailand, Malaysia, or Indonesia, and to some degree, competing with Japan and China in mall per capita. It's best to see these living museums to observe Filipino behavior and culture.

<p>Public markets are one microcosm of Manila. Practically, Manilans from all walks of life come here to buy their everyday needs. They are as lively and colorful as any market in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, or Vietnam. Generally, they are divided into wet and dry sections and another section for dining. Dining is very cheap and can be wholesomely hygenic. Just look out for the huge block of ice dragged along the floor on its way from the delivery truck to a dining stall. If you see one delivered in that manner, never mind, don't eat there, ever. Joking aside, a filling meal will cost you as little as US$1.25.

<p>If you happen to see just about every Tom, Dick, and Harry in a blighted neighborhood in Manila wearing Abercrombie &amp; Fitch &amp; Levis jeans, chances are it's original and bought at Ukay Ukays. How can they afford it? Ukay Ukay is the answer. It's the Philippines' answer to Salvation Army. Nowadays, they are everywhere and Manilans love them. Ukay ukay happens to be a contraction of the Tagalog word "<b>Hukay</b>" meaning to dig, the description for the exact action done while rummaging through the bins of clothes. But there are actually no bins installed in those stores, only clothes neatly hanged on the racks. For less than $2, one can find hand me down good qualities of branded wear. The more enterprising provide home delivery and roaming services by hanging them on racks installed on pedicabs, as they make the run on neighborhoods. Judging by the unafforable cost of living to most of the middle class and the soaring gasoline prices, they may be here to stay.
</p><p>It's also great for the budget tourist who would not want to have the hassle of packing and carrying tons of clothes by simply buying them here, then discarding them somewhere as his piles of souvenirs accumulate.

<p>Make sure you buy the traditional <b>barong Tagalog</b>. These are long shirts made of very light-weight, semi translucent material, often  with Filipino arts and decorations and are worn by both men and women on most special Filipino and formal occasions. Cotton varieties are much more affordable, but for the real deal, go for one made by the strands of a pineapple leaf. It is worn outside trousers - ie not "tucked in".

<p>Since Manila is part and parcel of the fabric of Metropolitan Manila, it is best to discuss it in general together with the adjacent and outlying areas same way as tourists will never want to just confine themselves inside the City of London when they enter Metropolitan London.

<p>Manila is a national hub of regional cooking and has almost all the regions of the Philippines represented - either in exclusively regional eateries or featured with other cuisines. General restaurants, either catering for the working class or the elite, can offer varied dishes coming from every region and cater for almost everyone's taste palette. For example, the northern region called Ilocos has its favorite fare called <b>Pinakbet</b> approved by practically everyone but still closely identified as Ilocano fare.

<p>Street Food is often described as "<b>Pamatid Gutom</b>" or food to tide over, something to temporarily hush a stomach growl, sold at small food stalls, food stands, or food carts set up in places with high amount of pedestrian traffic. Cheap and rushed, it could be something commuters can chew &amp; swallow, or gulp in seconds while transferring from one route to another, or from station to station, with a quick standing stop at a sushi, siomai, barbecue, or hotdog stall. 
</p><p>The variety of street food available is tremendous and may reward the truly adventurous traveler. Because of the huge variety, we have split the examples into two sections: those dishes normally sold by <b>Stationary Vendors</b> and those often sold by <b>Mobile Vendors</b>:

<p>Low income workers patronize them the most as they commute to their homes, often taking two-hour trips. These are noted in the open streets where they are the cheapest and these are what most bloggers and media immediately see. But there are ones that are as even cleaner as those found in <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> or at par with those in hawker centers in <a href="/en/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="/en/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="/en/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, or <a href="/en/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="/en/Korea" title="Korea">Korea</a>.
</p><p>Mall walkways and Food Courts offer a wide selection of Street Food menu and that is some notches less in worrying about hygiene. Expect the cost to be a little bit higher, although that would just come up to be in cents difference.
</p><p>For a taste of street food without the accompanying risk, try out the following establishments:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Balut Eggspress</b> - serves balut, kwek kwek and <b>one day old chicks</b>, which are quite literally day old chicks marinated and fried in hot oil then eaten whole including the bones. They have a stall in the MRT-3 Ayala Station.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Nanay Q</b> - serving special pork and chicken BBQ, liempo, grilled fish and shrimps. They also serve special Pinoy dishes such as Beef Caldereta, Menudo, Pinapaitan, Gambas and Sinigang. Sisig is also their specialty. They have branches at Robinsons Pioneer and Edsa Central. You may visit <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nanayq.com">[7]</a> for more info..</li></ul>
<p><b>Carinderyas/Carinderias</b> sound like Spanish style cooking but there is no relation to it. It's simply a collective term for a working class type of eating stall, now with table and seats for sit-in meals, more as a hole-in-the-wall or a makeshift school canteen (some may have wheels) for the lowly construction worker, the jeepney driver, or the student low and tight on budget. The style of presenting the food (no menus but some have posted menus) is laid out on a glass-covered or open counter in pots or deep square aluminum platters (for the more classy ones) and where the customer can just scan his eyes and choose what he wants.
</p><p><b>Panaderyas/Panaderias</b> are Bakeries dispensing bread and pastries. But the line is not clear if they are a separate class of their own or as Street Food. <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Goldilocks_Bakeshop&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Goldilocks Bakeshop (page does not exist)">Goldilocks Bakeshop</a> operate as a full-time restaurant but they can have some presence in malls as food stand types. <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dunkin%E2%80%99_Donuts&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dunkinâ Donuts (page does not exist)">Dunkinâ Donuts</a> or <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Mister_Donut&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mister Donut (page does not exist)">Mister Donut</a> also establish their presence as either a shop with dining tables or as a stand-alone stall.

<p>This is a special class of Street Food distinguished from the stationary establishments. Vendors roam around in their carts in a certain route and a specific time, as some foods sold are time sensitive, meaning they can only be eaten say, in the morning, or as an afternoon snack. Some of their itineraries are neighborhoods, where their target clientÃ¨le are preschool or school age children, and some are office blocks, where their prime targets are lady workers. There are only a few types of these food that are mobile.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Taho</b> - this ubiquitous mushy tofu, found in the whole Southeast Asia has this Philippine version topped with sugar syrup and tapioca balls. It's patronized mostly by children and construction workers in the morning.</li>
<li><b>Mais</b> - boiled corn-on-the-cob sold in the early to late afternoon.</li>
<li><b>Binatog</b> - boiled glutinous corn topped with coconut milk, sugar, and fresh coconut gratings.</li>

<p>Breakfast in the city is described as dry - meaning not wet as in noodle and soup or porridge like what is taken in the morning in most Southeast Asian cities. More like an amalgam of the East and the West, specifically the American, Hispanic, and Malay, somehow as if McDonald's and Cuban entrees collided with Nasi Lemak to form these creations that are very catchy to begin with for they all end with "<b>SILOG</b>".

<p>When it comes to dining, in a nutshell, Filipino food can be described as timid in flavor, not much creativity, as well as care for presentation. Food is trained to have only one dominant flavor - either the bitterness, the sweetness, the sourness, the saltiness, or the umaminess is enhanced. For some reason, the ingredients used don't have that wide range like those in Malaysia, Vietnam or Thailand, its closest neighbors. 
</p><p>Only half a century of American rule was enough to establish burgers and fried Filipino chicken as daily staples, while tapsilogan are where  you need to go for access traditional Filipino cuisine which still has all of the delicious  and unique elements that unite the food traditions here.
</p><p>One good thing for those with reticent palates is the absence of heavy spicing. For example in a close comparison between the Philippines and Vietnam on a vegetable &amp; spice market tour, the Philippine counterpart is limited. For seasoning, many Filipino dishes do not digress from the simplest use of garlic, onion, and tomatoes. On the herb section, only parsley, spring onion, and lemon grass are popularly known to Filipinos, while in Vietnam, there are so many kinds of herbs used in the daily diet by an average Vietnamese. 
</p><p>One glaring observation, basil and laurel are not eaten fresh, only as seasoning sold as dry as a dead leaf. As a side note, the saw-leaf herb which is an everyday ingredient in Vietnam which happened to originate in Mexico, ironically skipped the Philippines during the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade.
</p><p>Speaking of Acapulco, Mexicans drink tamarind as a beverage. Surprisingly another conundrum, tamarind juice coming from the tamarind fruit, being as Asian as rice, is surpisingly absent in the Philippine beverage menu even though it is popular in Latin America and the rest of the Southeast Asian countries, which are on its left and right spheres.
</p><p>Noodle varieties are limited to a handful. 
</p><p>Filipino food is safe to say more as a comfort food, that has some very different  origins to other asian foods. Its good if you seek it out.
</p><p>Filipinos have attained a higher degree of sophistication (although others would rather patronize Japanese and French cuisine to match their economic and educational attainment), the same ingredients are used and the same flavor is maintained. With increasing pride and economic competition among neighboring countries, nowadays, one can find Manila restaurant offering haute cuisine adobo laced with cayenne pepper and Spanish paprika.
</p><p>Most sit-down and casual dining restaurants in Manila would fall under the mid-range category. But there are budget ones as well. For budget dining, just follow the office workers making a beeline to building basements, canteens, or carinderias (road side stalls) during lunchbreak almost everywhere in the city and even in high class Makati area. The men usually wear short sleeved Barong Tagalog and the ladies, like bank teller attires. These are not lowly workers but they pay lunch as cheap as US$1.00 complete with a clear broth, a dish, and a cup of rice enough to energize the office worker for the rest of the day. University canteens open to the public offer student meals and have resident nutritionists too. Along Recto and Nicanor Reyes Sts., the epicenter of downtown university belt cosmos, there are dime a dozen shops that offer complete and filling budget meals as low as â±35.
</p><p>For those seeking access to the robustly independent and creative cuisine that exists here, hop in a cab to Mandaluyong. On Boni Avenue, just before the roundabout, you will find the Filipino food mecca of Manila,  R&amp;J Bulalohan Tapsilogan. This unpublished, undiscovered 24 hour establishmento is always packed with locals, chowing into every dish  discussed in the introduction. It's the "Line Clear" of the Philippines. Their Bulalo is number one in town,  photos of local celebrities adorn the bamboo walls, and a bucket of 6 beers will set you back only 240 pesos.  If you only eat local once in your trip, you must eat here. It's incredible.

<p>This oxymoron sums up what is all about eating in this genre of dining - eating high-end type seafood fares (prawns, tuna, abalone, and lobsters) most Filipinos can't afford, inside a humble shack. Dampa is a Tagalog term for a hovel on a roadside by the sea. That's where it all started. They may be there since time immemorial, mostly proliferating along the southern part of Metro Manila from the reclaimed area along Roxas Boulevard to Cavite - the next-door province south of Metro Manila, where the catch from the sea and Manila Bay was easily downloaded and freshly grilled for fish-loving Manilans, or may have been copied from dining experiences in trendsetting Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Bangkok, or Singapore. It has been transformed into more decent Singapore-style wet and fancy-free hawker center and to even air-conditioned "pearl-jade-dragon" style Chinese restaurant and now are scattered in every entertainment-dining district in the metropolis. But the billboard sign stays - Dampa-Style Dining.
</p><p>The concept is simple: catch (or pick) it and throw in the fire in real time - no time lapse in between, right before your eyes, so to speak. So one can savor it as fresh as it gets. Simply as it is, a spin off of turo-turo style (point and take) where arrays of dishes are arranged on a counter and the customer checks and chooses by pointing his forefinger, this time the ingredient is still alive, some in aquarium boxes. Then, the next thing to do is instruct the attendant what style it should be cooked and what other spice and vegetable ingredients to be added.
</p><p>This type of dining has also took-off from seafood to other ingredients like beef, pork, and chicken, etc.. And some variations, it may still be that lowly dampa-looking structure in the middle of a fish pen raising milk-fish or tilapia along Laguna de Bay or a rice paddy.

<p>Gaining steady popularity, it's less ubiquitous than in other East Asian cities and Asian dominated enclaves in the United States especially in the Korean and Chinese sections, may be due to the fact that Manilans (or Filipinos) are expertly witty in outsmarting these restaurants in overstretching the definition of buffet, giving a slim profit to the coffers and headache to its managers. But its one or two presence in every mall is an indication.

<p>Some of the food offered by these parlors may be also be on restaurant menus (since these are categorically dessert items), those that specialize in local cuisine. But these parlors are also a separate category of their own. <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Goldilocks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Goldilocks (page does not exist)">Goldilocks</a> and <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Red_Ribbon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Red Ribbon (page does not exist)">Red Ribbon</a>, super hygienic Americanized establishments stand out from the rest usually found in malls, and from the humble food stalls in the public markets where they originated. These two are basically bakeshops but they function as native ice cream parlors, serving more or less the following which are authentically or adaptively Filipino:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Ice Cream</b>- mostly serving never heard flavors at least in the western world such as purple yam, avocado, carabao cheese, coconut, or pandan.</li>
<li><b>Sago Parfait</b> - tapioca balls parfait.</li>
<li><b>Creamed Coconut and Pandan flavored Jellies</b></li>
<li><b>Almond Jellies Lychees</b> - also with shaved ice.</li>
<li><b>Sweetened Sport Coconut Flesh</b> - also with shaved ice.</li>
<li><b>Frozen Fruit Salad</b></li>
<li><b>Halo-Halo</b> - the queen of Philippine Snacks/Desserts, a Japanese invention of a salad of sweet beans and peas, jellies, and fruits and shaved ice found everywhere in the Far East. The Philippine version always has these ingredients  - young sweetened coconut shreddings called <b>Macapuno</b>, nipa palm nut flesh or <b>Kaong</b>, <b>Pinipig</b> or toasted sweet rice, <b>Ube</b> or purple yam paste, <b>Leche Flan</b> or egg custard, and ice cream.</li>

<p>Filipinos are great lovers of McDonalds and Pizza Hut, their dining style and menus. Hotdogs on sticks, hotdogs on buns, hamburgers or cheeseburgers, pizzas, and spaghettis are all popular. Their pictures proliferate everywhere, be it as street food or sit-in meal. Manilans also love donuts, particularly from <b>Mister Donut</b> whose products are not as sweet as its American counterparts. As a side note, Philippine style spaghettis are also done sweeter than elsewhere in the world. Fettucini and lasagna have already gained a foothold, and lately carbonara is fast becoming a favorite. 
</p><p>Manila has most of the usual American fast food chains such as <b>McDonald's</b>, <b>Burger King</b>, <b>Wendy's</b>, <b>Pizza Hut</b>, <b>Subway</b>, <b>Dairy Queen</b>, <b>Shakey's Pizza</b>, <b>Taco Bell</b>, <b>Dunkin Donuts</b>, <b>TGIF</b>, <b>Italianni's</b>, <b>Outback</b>, and <b>KFC</b>.  <b>Jollibee</b>, the Filipino counterpart of <b>McDonald's</b> is eclipsing its American-based competitor, who has long held a dominant position in the city. It started out as a spoof spin-off of <b>McDonald's</b>, copying its menu and business model, but substituting it with local ingredients (ex. mango pie for apple pie) and taking into consideration the local palate.  It has now has become a billion peso franchise business empire. Another spin-off of this business is <b>Chow King</b>, which has the same business model and packaging (styrofoams, plastics, and cardboards) but with Chinese influenced menus and has become as ubiquitous as <b>Jollibee</b> and <b>McDonalds</b>. Similarly, <b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.smdeals.com/deal/10-discount-on-solo-items-or-meals-09-2021xleos">Mang Inasal</a></b> follows the same pattern, but this time the theme is country or provincial style menu with banana leaf packaging, cane/bamboo baskets as plates, and claypots as serving plates catering to native food lovers.
</p><p>Coffee shops such as <b>Starbucks</b> and <b>Seattle's Best</b> have also recently become quite common in malls and commercial centers. Meals could be  as low as US$2-3 in most fast food joints. A typical burger meal with fries and a drink would fall under this range.

<p>The Philippines has its own version of the Spanish Tapas but little is known about it outside the country even if Filipinos have invaded almost all corners of the globe, employed and even permanently residing in their host countries. Anyway, it's more or less the same kind of presentation - as a finger, toothpick, or fork food, and relevance - to accompany any alcoholic drink, mostly beer, on a social gathering between neighbors, relatives, work colleagues, peers, and clients and mostly fall under male-bonding or camaraderie social dining. It comes from the root word "<b>PULUT</b>" meaning "to pick up".
</p><p>It is always served in a communal plate or bowl with plenty of forks (if it needs to pick up the food, otherwise finger is OK) arrayed on a plate like oars on a boat. If there's a need for a dipping sauce, then a bowl is also served with it to be used communally.

<p>A very localised drinking experience in Manila are beer gardens (or beerhouses as commonly called). They are scattered mostly around the working districts of Sampaloc, Santa Mesa, Quiapo and even the tourist belt areas of Ermita and Malate. Every city in the metropolis has practically its own adult entertainment strip, block, or district where these establishments can be found.  These are heavily sexualized. It's mostly working class men and those working in the military and police establishments who are the clientÃ¨le with young sexy and provocatively dressed waitresses or euphemistically called GROs or Guest Relations Officers serving the customers. Some beer gardens take it up a level higher and have entertainment on the sides with scantily two-piece suit dancers taking turns on the stage. The kind of food served somewhat resemble the Spanish Tapas style ranging from the simple such as peanuts, corn, and peas - boiled or deep fried to mundane such as fried pork, beef, chicken to the adventurous such as other body parts - ears, gizzards, livers, hearts, intestines, brains, balls, blood, and what have you. They are categorized under the subject <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Pulutan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pulutan (page does not exist)">Pulutan</a>.
</p><p>For establishments resembling the western version of a pub, these establishments are concentrated in <b>Remedios Circle</b> in <b>Malate</b> district a very important hub of nightlife, as well as in <b>Bonifacio Global Village</b> in <b>Taguig City</b>, <b>Tomas Morato</b> in <b>Kamuning</b> District in <b>Quezon City</b>, and <b>Eastwood</b> in <b>Libis</b> District, <b>Quezon City</b>. Bohemian <a href="/en/Manila/Malate" title="Manila/Malate">Malate</a>, the older <a href="/en/Manila/Ermita" title="Manila/Ermita">Ermita</a> neighborhood and the <b>Baywalk</b> that stretches between them contains a variety of venues serving a combination of food, comedy, alcohol, and live music.
</p><p>Karaoke and Videoke bars are also very common as the majority of Manilans are American Idol fans.

<p>Manila has a largely English-speaking, educated, and low wage labor force.  There are no readily available job opportunities for travelers.  Common backpacker jobs found in other parts of Asia, such as English teaching, do not exist here.
</p><p>That said there are a number of foreigners working in Manila.  The thriving call center industry, in particular, employs a number of Americans in management or training roles.  Keep in mind that virtually all hiring of foreigners takes place in their home country, and not in the Philippines.
</p><p>Foreigners also occasionally work at NGOs, all types of which exist in the Philippines. Others have opened businesses. 
</p><p>Standard working time varies, especially with the proliferation of Call Centers, but the usual working hours are 8AM-5PM. Given that the traffic within the Manila escalates exponentially as the day begins, it's always better to leave early for meetings.
</p><p>There is also a local saying known as "Filipino Time" wherein it was expected that the attendee would be late by up to one hour. However, this has been significantly reduced through the years, although the bad traffic is usually (and realistically) cited as the main cause for missing one's appointment.
</p><p>Makati City is the country's main CBD, or Central Business District, and, on every given weekday, it seems that all roads lead here. Multinational firms and big businesses hold offices here. 
</p><p>Ortigas Center, which cuts across the borders of Mandaluyong City, Pasig City and Quezon City, seems to be the alternative CBD, with companies such as the Asian Development Bank headquarters and the World Bank Manila office located in this vicinity.

<p><i><b>Check for accommodation listings in the appropriate <a href="#Districts">districts</a></b></i>
</p><p>You can sleep in a Manila Hotel for as cheap as â±500 per night if you wish. Don't expect many luxuries at this price though!
</p><p>There are dorms for â±99/night near the Clover Leaf Cafe in Kalayaan Avenue, Makati. These are massive single-sex rooms with 20-30 beds; mostly locals come here for job training/interviews.
</p><p>Manila has a lot of hotels, inns and apartelles. Most of these accommodations can be found within Roxas Boulevard overlooking Manila Bay, or in the districts of Ermita and Malate. Manila's hotel accommodations are 20 to 30 minutes away from the international and domestic airport. 
</p><p>There are many major international hotel chains which have a presence in Metro Manila. Rates are still generally cheaper here compared to the same class of hotels in western cities. A stay in these hotels however, would be considered a luxury by Philippine standards - particularly since these rates would represent a month's income for some Filipinos.

<p>Payphones are very common in the city center.  The use of mobile phones is also very extensive.  To use your mobile phone, it has to be at least a dualband GSM phone.  Globe and Smart are the Philippine's largest mobile carriers and they invite you to use them as a roaming partner (inquire from your home carrier if they have Globe and Smart as a roaming partner).   
</p><p>To call anywhere within Metro Manila, simply dial the 7-digit telephone number from a payphone or a landline.  If you need to call anywhere else within the Philippines, dial 0 + area code + telephone number.  To make an international phone call, dial 00 + country code + area code + telephone number.  
</p><p>Internet cafes have become a common sight in Metro Manila. Most malls would have at least one internet cafe.  Most internet cafes provide broadband speeds.  <b>Netopia</b> and <b>Pacific Internet</b> are common chains. Netopia also has a branch at the MRT-3 Ayala Station.  Cheap overseas calls can be made at Netopia branches via their VOIP service.
</p><p>Most coffee shops now also have WiFi services available so you can surf the net while sipping a cuppa.  Airborneaccess.net and WIZ are the most common WiFi providers.  Ask around if usage is free of charge, otherwise, as the case is often, you will have to buy an internet access card at the counter.

<p>Manila can be dangerous and many parts of this city have slums with poor people and criminals. Use caution on where you are located. 
</p><p>Suffice it to say that it is not convenient to wander around carefree as one would encounter sidewalks fringed with makeshift shanties that lead to a sudden turn into a labyrinth of squatter neighborhoods. It is very scary if not annoying encountering lolling group of male adult and teenage bystanders, although nowadays, these areas are most likely manned by village watchmen and everyone is more than willing to help and interact with lost strangers. 
</p><p>Nuisances that impedes a pleasurable walking tour are dirty and malnourished children who freely use the streets as their playground, manholes that were left open (or probably its cover stolen to be sold as metal scrap), dog feces, uncollected garbage, undisciplined cars and mostly jeepneys weaving in and out of the lanes as they pick up passengers, as well as political billboards.
</p><p>A popular scam as of recent days is for someone to approach you and pretend they recognize you. They will say they work at your hotel (such as room service or security) and that they know you from there. They then say it is their day off and since they just happened to bump into you they want to show you something nice that is nearby. They may be very convincing even to experienced travelers. It is always a scam.
</p><p>Another popular scam is for a con artist to befriend a tourist and offer to show them around, hang out, etc. After gaining the tourist's trust, the con artist then slips drugs into the tourist's food or drinks. The con artist then leads the drugged, groggy victim to an ATM and watches while he/she enters her pin. The con artist is then free to withdraw all the money from the account.
</p><p>Get into a car or go anywhere with people <b>only if you know them</b>  (even of they say that have helped you at the hotel on a previous occasion). Of course, if you ask them which hotel they will not be able to answer. They are best fended off if you just ignore them. If they persist, say, "Are you going to leave me alone or should I call the police?" in Filipino. That makes them leave quickly, though they are likely to return to rob you if you do not react and leave the incident the moment they come back armed.
</p><p>Theft is common, especially pick pocketing. You should act cautiously as you would in any other poor country, especially considering if you do not look like a local. Thieves and scam artists are likely to see you as an easy target.
</p><p>Avoid wearing jewelry or other valuables that will broadcast your wealth. Displaying that expensive mobile phone or digital camera out in the open is also a good way to attract thieves.
