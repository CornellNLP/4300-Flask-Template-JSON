<p><b>Ulaanbaatar</b> (Улаанбаатар), also known as Ulan Bator or simply just UB, is the capital of Mongolia. With a population of around 1.3 million, it is the largest city in Mongolia, standing as its political, commercial, industrial, and cultural hub. For business and pleasure trips alike, you will find yourself coming to the city at least once. Knowing and exploring the city properly can help you understand the country’s history and its wonderful people. One will often see the past and the present are still living side by side.

<p>In the history of the Mongolian people, there have been several well-known cities built as capital cities such as Kharakhorum during the 13th century Great Mongolian Empire. But none of them survived as an active capital city until the 16th century. With the active introduction of Lamaism in Mongolia from the 16th century, permanent monastic establishments started to emerge when Tibetan Buddhism flourished. The most important of such settlements was the residency palace of Mongolia’s first spiritual leader named Zanabazar or Jebtsundamba Khutuktu in the year 1649. The year is now considered as the founding date of Mongolia’s modern capital city, Ulaanbaatar. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ulaanbaatar.mn/content/show/20">[2]</a> The city was first named Ikh Khuree, literally meaning “large circle” as the city was circular shaped. After changing locations in the central part of Mongolia over 20 times, it settled at its current location in the year 1778.  
</p><p>Much of the modern architecture of Ulaanbaatar started to shape in the 20th century with the influence from Russian architecture. The modern-day UB showcases a mix of Soviet architecture, ger settlements, Buddhist monasteries and 21st century high rises. Among Buddhist temples, most notables are the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://mongoliantemples.org/index.php/en/2014-07-01-06-17-25/ub-temples/ubtemplesnew/"><b>Gandan Tegchinlen Monastery</b></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.templemuseum.mn/"><b> Choijin Lama Temple</b></a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.bogdkhaanpalace.mn/index.php/en-us/"><b>Bogd Khan Winter Palace Museum </b></a>.

<p>Travelers who take the time to get to explore the city will discover a hospitable and warm-hearted people. The demographics of city are divided into two major parts. One part of the population lives in condominiums in the central part of the city while the majority of the population lives in what is called as <b>ger districts</b>. These districts, traditionally a home to many of the city’s blue and white collared workers, became lately a home to many migrating ex-nomads who in recent years have come to the city to find work after severe winters have killed their livestock. 
</p><p>Peace Avenue (Enkh Taivny Örgön Chölöö) is the main street and it stretches from east to west through the center. It's the main shopping street and many of the restaurants are found alongside it. The street also passes by the southern edge of the central square, Chinggis Square. Tourist Information Centers are located on the first floor of Ulaanbaatar Bank Small Ring#15 and at Seoul Street.

<p>The city is officially divided into 9 districts with 7 of them located within or around the city area. Nalaikh and Baganuur are the two districts that have their own city infrastructure located within a 138 km radius of the city. Both of these cities are located on the east side of UB and were originally built as mining towns. On any eastbound journeys, travelers will find themselves stopping traveling through these cities. In the capital city, the four original districts are Sukhbaatar, Songino Khairkhan, Bayanzurkh, and Bayangol where the majority of the city population lives today. Most downtown premises are located in the Sukhbaatar district.

<p>Although summer temperatures can be over 30°C, the city shivers in sub-zero temperatures for five months of the year, with January and February being the coldest months with temps hovering between -15°C to -40°C. The duration of the heating season is 180 days. As a result of these prolonged periods of intense cold, the city has an average annual temperature of -1.3°C, giving it the dubious distinction of being the world's coldest capital. If you have breathing problems, be aware that Ulaanbaatar has high levels of Air Pollution [2]. Ulaanbaatar has a population just over a twentieth of Beijing; yet according to the World Health Organization, Ulaanbaatar is considered the second most polluted city in the world in 2013 - behind Ahvaz, Iran. But the countryside air, away from the cities, is gorgeous. The majority of the pollution comes from coal burning as 92% of households use stove for heating and cooking. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/events/2015/7-ESCC-Meeting-Mongolia/Presentation-Materials/Session-1.Air-Pollution-Reduction-Measurements-in-Mongolia.pdf">[3]</a>

<p>Ulaanbaatar is Mongolia’s largest city. In 1956, it had 14.4% of total population of Mongolia. As of 2012, around 45.8% of the Mongolian total population was living in the capital.  It has a density rate of 272/km2. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/events/2015/7-ESCC-Meeting-Mongolia/Presentation-Materials/Session-1.Air-Pollution-Reduction-Measurements-in-Mongolia.pdf">[4]</a>
Ger district in Ulaanbaatar city has been expanding due to the income level of families that moved from rural areas to the city and newly established family, and also a lack of apartments connected with centralized sub-structure.  According to the statistical information,  47.2% of Ulaanbaatar’s total population were born and raised in the city without moving and living anywhere else, indicating that almost 50% of the other part have migrated to the city after 1990. About 40% of the city’s population lives in the housing districts and remaining 60% live in ger districts. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/events/2015/7-ESCC-Meeting-Mongolia/Presentation-Materials/Session-1.Air-Pollution-Reduction-Measurements-in-Mongolia.pdf">[5]</a>

<p>Ulaanbaatar city is a center of Mongolian political, economic, society and culture. Around 45% of total population and 65% of total companies are only in Ulaanbaatar. Therefore, majority of deposits and loans granted to individuals and companies, cars and doctors are in Ulaanbaatar city. Role of Ulaanbaatar to Mongolian economy is massive as the country’s best health, education, production and financial operations are centered in the city. 88.5% of total universities of Mongolia locate in Ulaanbaatar city and 95.3% of total students of the country study also in the city. Thus, the city is the center of social, economic, administrative and cultural activities.

<p>Once in the country, any small or big towns will have a local bus or van traveling to UB. Buses used to be notorious for being late and on some routes for not even arriving on the scheduled day. But due to more bus companies emerging and competition, the service and quality of buses have improved drastically lately. Domestic buses usually go to Dragon Center (СХД18-р хороо, 18072 Улаанбаатар), Teevriin Tovchoo (near Main Railway Station ) and the eastern bus station near the Botanical Gardens (the Gardens are completely destroyed, but the location is well known to the locals).

<p>Generally, there are two types of taxi services you can use in the city.  There are cabs that carry the designated taxi symbols and there are non-marked private cars driven by their owners who pull over to pick passengers. Don’t be surprised if any car just stops and offers a ride. It is the most commonly available taxi service at the moment, a practice that started in early 1990s when there were fewer cars in the streets. Some drivers even pick up passengers while transporting infants. 
</p><p>Taxis have a standard rate of 1,500₮/km, more after midnight. In newer taxis there will be a square LCD meter – make sure this is on at the end. If travelling in a more informal taxi, agree on the fare at the beginning and be sure to write it down. Don't be fooled by tricks like "I meant 3,000 for each of you."
</p><p>Please note that few taxi drivers speak English, so it's best to have the name and destination written in Mongolian.
</p><p>The service UBCab has a wide variety of drivers in the city (and other towns throughout the country). The app has an English interface and several classes of drivers – from small private operators to luxury taxi services. From 1,000₮/km + 1,000₮ to start the ride.
</p><p>Taxi drivers can also be rented by the hour or day. Some hotels are glad to organize such for you (incl. the handling of payment). It is fairly easy to organize a driver speaking <a href="/en/Russian_phrasebook" title="Russian phrasebook">Russian</a>. Other languages available on request (even though rarely found and thus more expensive) include <a href="/en/German_phrasebook" title="German phrasebook">German</a>, <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=English_phrasebook&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="English phrasebook (page does not exist)">English</a> and <a href="/en/Chinese_phrasebook" title="Chinese phrasebook">Mandarin Chinese</a>

<p>Most attractions in the city are located closer to the Peace Avenue, which is the city’s main horizontal avenue. Therefore, by taking a bus from one end to another will take you close to most of these sites. From example, in order to visit Gandan Monastery, take a bus along the line that stops at the West Junction (in Mongolian: baruun 4 zam) junction, which is a popular landmark for directions. It is where Ramada Inn hotel is also located. Gandan Monastery is visible just to the north side of it.  
</p><p>Buses are regular and have a fixed charge of T500 per ride. Electric trolley-buses cost T300 but are slower and run fewer routes. After midnight, only trolley-buses are available at a rate of T1,000 per ride. But they go for only two main routes. Smaller buses (really just vans), called micro-bus, are equally accessible at T500. These have someone who hangs out the window at each stop shouting the name of the destination in rapid Mongolian. A bit hard to understand.
</p><p>Many of the city buses go out to the edge of the city. Route 22, goes southwest to the Bird Farm along the Tuul River. Catch the bus at the Ard Cinema bus stop, the Cinema has been replaced by a Khas Bank. This bus stop is located on Bagatoiruu Street, from the central Post Office walk west along Peace Ave. At the intersection with the traffic lights, cross the street and turn right (north) half a block and you will reach a small square with the bus stop.

<p>Beginning from November, 2015, in order to travel by bus, you need Bus Card which you can purchase near the bus stops from stores and kiosks with the sign “U money”. You can still pay cash but it will be about twice the amount. You are also required to pay the exact amount so if you end up giving higher domination bills, no change will be provided.

<p>Walking is also an option as the city center is quite compact. Having only one main avenue, Ulaanbaatar stretches from east to west and it's also easy to draw a mental map. But getting around ger districts can be puzzling. Get a good city map at the Mongolian Government Map shop, located on Ih Toiruu Street. West from the State Department Store three blocks, the first intersection with traffic lights, turn right (north) about one-half block, on the east side of the street you will see a yellow and blue Elba Appliance store. The Map Shop is behind and inline with the North wall of the Elba. But purchasing a map from the airport would help save you a lot of time. Finding specific places or offices by address is quite challenging because locals will usually tell you the places by nearest landmarks such as West Junction (supposed to be Undsen Huuliin gudamj) and Urt Tsagaan (which is Tourist Street1) and along the department store (Peace Avenue). Sometimes locals will not know any better than you as they too never seen some street names put on the streets. Especially when you buy guide books, look for books with pictures printed so that it would help you ask locals about places rather than only showing written addresses with postal codes.

<p>UB has a host of souvenir shops aimed at Korean/Japanese and European/American tourists. While the quality of the goods varies, the price tends to be high at the downtown stores but on the outskirts, you can find some good deals. Most prices are at their actual value and haggling is discouraged. You'll likely just get a discount of 10-15%.
</p>
<ul><li>Traditional clothes, boots, and hats, cashmere garments, jewelry, leather wall hangings, miniature gers, bow and arrow sets, and paintings.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Peace Avenue</b> and <b>the Circus</b> area are the main shopping areas.</li>
<li>The 6th floor of the <b>State Department Store</b> has a section with souvenir paintings, but prices are higher than in some of the smaller stores.</li>
<li>The Narantuul <b>(AKA Black )</b> Market, known to locals simply as <i>zach</i> (зах), is the place to haggle over cheap clothes, toys, swords, or Soviet propaganda pins. Only take a minimum of cash with you in a money belt or inner jacket pocket and leave all valuables at your accommodation, as pickpockets are common here. It's a ten-minute bus or taxi ride from the city center.  Don't expect a tourist market though.  This is primarily a huge open-air market for locals to buy clothing.  Difficult to locate items of interest to tourists. To get here take either ч30A or ч30B from in front of Sükhbataar Square (on Peace Avenue). 9AM-7PM W-M, closed Tuesday.</li></ul>
<p>Tellers at the Golomt Bank can give up to USD500 per day cash advance on MasterCard and Visa.
</p><p>Most ATMs accept most international cards, including Maestro and Plus. An earlier report mentioned that Cirrus cards are only accepted at the airport, this is probably untrue.
</p><p>It is relatively easy to find an ATM to withdraw cash. As long as your ATM, debit, or credit card has the VISA logo, you can withdraw tögrög, the local currency. Other card types are also accepted, simply not as widely, for example, the machines in the central Post Office and main street will not accept foreign MasterCards although they bear the logo. The machines in Golomt Bank branches are more reliable. Also on the 2nd floor of the State Department Store, you can find an ATM accepting foreign cards. Many shops take credit cards, but some establishments run strictly on cash. Note that most credit card companies will pass on the 3% "foreign currency conversion fee" to you.
</p><p>There are many exchange offices in the center along Peace Avenue to change your currency into tugrugs. One is on the ground floor of the State Department Store. Better rates are at the Exchange Center on the second floor of the Flower Center. The Flower Center is located on Peace Ave. one block west of the Post Office, at the corner with traffic lights between the Post Office and State Department Store. Large hotels like the Ulaanbaatar Hotel one block east of Chinggis Square will exchange money 24/7 at the reception, which may be your only option if you arrive very late in the day.

<p>The old notion of “nobody travels to Mongolia for the food” might change soon as more and more good-quality restaurants are opening in Ulaanbaatar, offering a good range of Western, Asian, and Mongolian delicacies. You can get perfectly reasonable pizza for $3, even a night out at a fancy French cafe shouldn't pass $20. Consider splurging on a couple of good meals here, especially if headed out for a long trek into the country. Fresh vegetables, especially in winter, are hard to come by and expensive.
Korean (solongos khoolnee gazar) and Chinese restaurants dominate the city. As Asian restaurants in America tend to tailor their menu to the American palate, in Ulaanbaatar do the East Asian restaurants tailor their menu to the Central Asian palate (meaning more meat!).
</p><p>You'll find numerous restaurants of just about every persuasion you would find anywhere in the world. You will immediately notice that both the restaurants and coffee houses (including the restrooms) are a magnitude cleaner than most anywhere else on the continent.

<p>Throughout Ulaanbaatar are many small Гуанз (eateries) and Цайны Газарs (cafes.) Try one of these for cheap Mongolian food. Buuz usually costs ₮600-800. Most universities have a good cafeteria for cheap eats for ₮1800 (less than $1) - ₮2500 ($1.30). Khuushuur, which is a fried meat pie, is another popular street or fast food Mongolians love. Try them at one of the local cafeterias you might visit. Khuushuur usually costs ₮800-1000.
</p><p>Mongolian National University and Mongolian University of Science and Technology (both near the North East block from the Parliament Building) have good cafeterias. All university cafeterias have nutritionists so at least you know you are getting all the basic nutrients when you eat there.

<p>Nightlife in Ulaanbaatar is surprisingly wild but is best not experienced alone — try to get a local to join you. Most of the nightclubs play Trance, Techno, Electronic, and House music, a few clubs play hip-hop music. The small clubs in the 3rd district and the Sansar micro district are best avoided. Be sure to apologize if you hit someone or step on his or her feet accidentally because some Mongolians can be offended by it.
Beer in clubs costs about ₮3500 (less than $2), other drinks such as vodka depend on measurements, for example, a 100 g Vodka costs about ₮4500 ($2.25) The club life is very active on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. On Fridays, it is very hard to find a seat in a club. According to state law, all clubs and pubs (bars) must be closed after midnight, but some clubs run until 4:00 AM. On the first of every month, you can't buy any alcohol, be it in a shop or in a bar. Never go alone in the dark, especially on Fridays. Also never walk by yourself when you are drunk, or you may be arrested and end up in the drunk tank, not a pleasant place to be.

<p>Nowadays, budget accommodation in Ulaanbaatar tends to give the best deals for a traveler. Usually, a bed in a clean dormitory costs about $7-15 and a double room should be under $30 a night. Good mid-range options are sparse. 
Note that during the annual Naadam festival it is almost impossible to get any kind of accommodation in UB without prior reservations.
</p><p>Guest homes may not respond to email (only 2 of 5 responded to us). 
Be aware that in August 2009 the government passed a law requiring domestic transactions to be priced in the Mongolian currency (MNT).  
Some guest homes attempt to charge more than the price on their website saying their website is out-of-date. Some may charge a price higher than the price you have agreed to pay from your on-line reservation, citing that the exchange rate has changed.
Many guest homes operate also as Tour Guide/Operator/Agency and are more interested in selling a tour and devote less attention to the guest house facilities in room size/space, a limited number of bathrooms/showers relative to the number of beds, internet WiFi service shut off at 22:00 and turned on at 09:00, and so forth.  
</p><p>Budget private rooms are often located in rented apartments in complexes away from the main guesthouse. Guesthouses rent these from nomadic families during the summer peak season and return them when the family returns to the city for the winter months. Dark and dirty stairwells are the norm in Ulaanbaatar.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stay_safe">Stay safe</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Ulaanbaatar&amp;action=edit&amp;section=45" title="Edit section: Stay safe">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The crime rate in Ulaanbaatar is "very high" compared to most Asian cities. Pickpocketing and violent muggings are a higher risk in the capital than in rural areas so it is advisable to avoid walking alone after dark. Street lighting is unreliable and visitors will occasionally come across drunks and stray dogs. The places where pickpocketing is the most frequent are buses and the Narantuul market (alias Black market), especially the entrances of them. The bus stops close to the State department stores are hot spots for this activity. If you've been attacked or pick-pocketed, please take time to make a deposition at the district police station and to notify your embassy if you have one.
</p><p>Unfortunately, xenophobia is rampant, and violence towards foreigners happens often. Violence is part of everyday life in Mongolia and especially in the capital violent crime rates are among the highest in Asia. Alcoholism is a huge social problem in Mongolia. Do not acknowledge or approach any Mongolian man under the influence of alcohol. Nearly all foreigners who go to bars/clubs at night report assault and general aggression.
</p><p>Walking on the streets at any time is a hazardous affair as one needs to contend with ice from about October to March, open manholes, and extremely chaotic and wild driving habits. Drivers (including buses and police) pay no attention to pedestrian crossings and will not reduce speed but simply sound their horns.  The automobile culture in this city is too new to have developed safe driving systems and habits. 
</p><p>Unmarked taxis are common and shouldn't be feared. Locals simply stick out an arm and hitchhike anywhere around town. However, it is wise to get a local interpreter if possible and explain the fare system. 
</p><p>Child beggars may be seen, but watch out for groups of them, as one may be trying to pick your pocket.  Also be aware that any money you do donate will go straight to their teenage "pimps", and so you may not be helping them as much as you think. 
</p><p>Walking at night in company shouldn't be too great of a concern; it isn't for the locals. But stick to areas where you can see lots of locals (especially women). Coming out of bars late at night is a little dangerous if you are alone; try to have several males in your group.
