<p>Pune has a glorious history of nearly 1600 years. Pataleshwar caves (near Jangli Maharaj Road) from the 5th century is an evidence to Pune’s old settlements. Rashtrakut (राष्ट्रकुट) Kings had built a beautiful temple of Shiva called Punyeshwar, which was unfortunately destroyed during Sultan’s attack on city in 13th century. Since Pune is in the state of Maharashtra, most of the residents are ethnic Marathi. (or Maharashtrians).
</p><p>There is a lot to be said about Pune being called "Oxford of the East". Simply put, Pune is a bona fide, one hundred percent university town although it seems too much to call it a university city. There are colleges and institutes galore here. From engineering (COEP) to medicine (BJ), arts (FC) to science (SP), Pune has everything. And it has the single most variety of students in India; besides that, there are students from outside India. What this all means is that in Pune, you're always young. The vibrancy is tremendous; for example just stroll along Fergusson Road on a Saturday evening. It's full, crowded and thriving and extremely lively. Or go to Durga Coffee House on Paud Road near MIT College  in early December or early June at about 12 midnight. You will see a massive crowd of students gulping down hot coffee in an attempt to stay awake for their examinations.

<p>Pune currently does not have a civil airport to its name. However some commercial international airlines do operate from a military airport located just 5 kms away from the city's East side (Koregaon Park / Kalyani nagar). Pune airport <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.puneairport.com">[4]</a> is served by almost all domestic carriers. The number of flights is however limited since the airport is under the control of the air force. Currently, international flights operate only to <a href="/en/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a>. If getting a direct flight proves difficult, then taking a flight to <a href="/en/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and then traveling by taxi or train to Pune is one feasible option. Mumbai-Pune taxi journey should take around four hours and costs about Rs. 1800-3000 depending on car type. Cheaper options are also available as this is very popular route.
</p><p>Alternatively, international travelers may find it convenient to fly via <a href="/en/Delhi" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> and then take a second connecting flight. This option may be quicker as it avoids the four hour taxi ride from <a href="/en/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> which is prone to delays over weekends or in rainy days. <a href="/en/Delhi" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> - Pune flight time is just about 2 hours and Delhi airport is very modern and pleasant for a stopover. 
</p><p>The airport is in Lohegaon, which is around 10km from the city center, and takes about 30 minutes - 1 hour to reach (depending on traffic conditions).

<p><b>State Government run Vs Private Buses</b><br />
</p><p>Tourists traveling between Pune and Mumbai/ Thane are advised to travel by the state government run buses (MSRTC) wherever possible. State Government has two types of Buses one AC Shivneri and other non-AC Hirkani. Private and Govt. buses cost almost the same (Rs.300 - Rs.465 ) as the private buses and they have fewer stops on the way as private buses try to pick passengers on the way. Buses run very frequently (every 15 mins) and are also punctual. You can be sure of reaching your destination within the stipulated time. Most of the private buses wait till they get enough passengers before departing - which causes a lot of delay in getting to your destination.

<p>There is also a huge army of three wheeled <b>rickshaws</b>. There are some <b>prepaid rickshaw stands</b> at Shivajinagar, Swargate Bus Depot, and Lohegaon Airport. Nevertheless, always demand that they use the meter and that they show you the sheet of paper (referred as Tariff Card) which converts the rickshaw meter readings to the actual cost in rupees. As of 15 Oct.2013 the conversion equation is&#160;: <i>Cost = 17 (for first 1.5 km) + (reading - 1.5km)* 11</i>, where "<i>Cost</i>" is the actual fare in rupees and "<i>Reading</i>" is the meter reading which is supposed to be Kilometers traveled. Thus a 2 on the meter is actually Rs (17 + ((2-1.5)*11) = Rs 22.5 Or a 3.50 on the meter is Rs (17+ 2*11) = Rs 39.
</p><p>As of December 2014, MOST auto rickshaws have a new electronic meter, whereby the tariff card is redundant. It correctly gives the kms travelled and fare in exact change. This was done after a lot of protests from autorickshaw unions, probably the only city in India to have a neat and clean metering system. Just pay what is on the meter. No need to even talk. 
</p><p>Driver may ask for directions depending on how familiar he is with the area. All rickshaws plying in the Municipal Corporation limits are supposed to charge fare according to tariff card. Most of the times they will try to charge you a little extra but that won't be too much. You can very well argue with them based on the conversion equation stated above, and sometimes they will agree to it. 
</p><p>Nowadays, many auto rickshaw drivers try to charge extra for long distances or very short distances, or they refuse the fare. If they realise you are not from the city, they may try to take longer routes to the destination to charge extra money from you. Outsiders and foreigners should, therefore, use their own judgment before boarding any auto rickshaw. Stick to the demand of charging by meter and refuse strongly to pay any extra amount, unless it is midnight. Autorickshaw drivers may also refuse to travel to quite a few parts of the city as per their convenience; however, this is against the law if their meter reads "on hire" in the upright position. If the sign is turned sideways, the rickshaw driver is not technically working and can refuse you.
</p><p>It is very common for rickshaw drivers plying between 11 PM and 6 AM to demand 1.5 times the normal rates for the journey. You are advised to get this cleared with the driver before boarding the rickshaw. It is also sometimes advisable to flag a rickshaw from the streets (if practical and possible) instead of boarding one from the stands as often, rickshaw drivers waiting in stands demand more fare.
</p><p>If you have complaints against auto drivers for not accepting short distance rides (or any rides), asking more meter fare, not using a meter, taking other passengers along the way, carrying more passengers than allowed capacity, stopping at bus stands or other similar complaints of serious nature, you can email or call the Road Transport Authorities at 020-22051414 or 020-27492828 (PCMC) or email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="196b6d76696c777c597d786d7876777c377077">[email&#160;protected]</a>. Traffic cops usually come right away to the spot to book a complaint against the driver. Commuters can also send their MMS pictures at +91 9420218338. The complaints should clearly mention all details including the auto’s registration number, the time of taking the rickshaw, details of auto fare, the distance commuted, locations, date, time, nature of complaint.
</p><p>If you would like to avail a rickshaw in a planned way (as against impromptu hailing one from the street) autowale.in is a reliable service. You need to indicate the source and destination point of your intended trip, and the time and place where you want the rickshaw to report. It's very much like a cab booking service, and takes the hassle out of arguing with the rickshaw drivers about the fare.

<p>This city was once known as the <b>city of bicycles</b>, but now it has turned into the <b>city of motorcycles</b>. <b>Most traffic rules are completely ignored</b> in Pune, since there are ten times as many two-wheelers as there are cars. Lane discipline is generally tough to follow because of this reason. The general attitude towards riding motorbikes in the city is that of total ignorance of any set forth traffic regulations along with complete disregard of one's safety (not wearing a helmet). Here people ride motorbikes as if they are riding a war horse and will generally try to overtake every vehicle in front. Minor accidents on motorbikes are common; You are advised to be careful even when your signal is green as the traffic flow from other direction generally does not stop immediately. 
</p><p>Pune's roads might turn to horrid potholes from smooth tarmac in matter of seconds when it rains. Always be on a lookout. If you are driving a car always be careful, since motorbike riders may overtake you from left or right and cut lanes without warning. Of late, there has been an improvement by addition of a number of bicycle tracks all over.
</p><p>That said, if you do want to hire a two wheeler, there are two outfits who rent '2 wheels' in Pune. A 100cc Bajaj Platina will cost 200 INR a day and an automatic Honda scooter will cost 300 INR. If you are planning on day trips from Pune you would be best with the larger wheels and light weight of a motorcycle rather than a scooter. Both outfits will most likely deliver to your accommodation if you ask nicely.

<p>If you are looking for budget accommodation in Pune as someone outside India you may run into difficulty, especially if you are a backpacker with and/or long hair. Many lodges under 800Rs will not allow foreigners, this is claimed to be a law but this is not true, however you will hear many hotel owners speak of nightly police searches or that Indian rooms are just "not compatible" with Westerners. This bigotry be traced back to the 1970s when many Rajneeshi would stay in cheap guesthouses and disappear without payment. Try to arrange accommodation in advance, splash out or stay elsewhere.

<p><b>A day trip from Pune</b>
</p><p>Pune - Bhuleshwar - Purandar - Sinhagad - Pune
</p><p>This round trip takes in some of the interesting hill forts around Pune. Total distance is about 220km and will take 6 hours just to drive the loop, with lunch and sightseeing added on. The full trip could take up to 12 hours so leave a full day. It is suggested that this trip is undertaken either by motorcycle or 4WD due to the state of some of the roads that are encountered. It is possible to make the journey in a regular car (and many do - even auto ricks) but it will take longer and there will be a heavy toll on the cars suspension. To be as safe as possible you would also want some experience on driving on broken/ unsurfaced roads and dealing with the challenges of driving in India.
</p><p>Leave Pune on the National Highway 9 (Pune Solapur Highway) which passes the racecourse. This is a toll road and also very busy with cars and trucks. If you have taken a motorcycle be very careful.
</p><p>The turn off to Bhuleshwar is about 35km from Pune and shortly after the second toll booth (about 2km before Yavat village). A concrete bridge crosses a canal and the turn off is to the right just before the bridge. There is no sign in English, but there is a sign to Deccan Industrial Explosives pte. After 5km or so the road will climb into some ghats, where the road becomes quite broken. Once you reach the top of the ghats you will see the temple and a prominent radio mast to the right. The turn to the temple is the next right, the road becomes quite steep at some points.
</p><p>After visiting the temple and fort (allow 30 to 40 mins), return to the road and turn right where you turned off. This road will take you to Saswad (or Sasvad on some maps). There are several turnoffs, keep heading west, but also plenty of people to ask the way, nearly everyone knows Saswad. The scenery is quite flat though enlivened by scenes of Indian rural life. The road is paved but quite rough. You can take lunch when you reach the town.
</p><p>Thereafter, ask the way for Purandar itself or Nasrapur which is where the road goes. Many people know it. The road is the Diwale to Narayanpur road. In fact the hill itself is easy to spot as it towers above <a href="/en/Narayanpur" title="Narayanpur">Narayanpur</a>. After 5km after the turnoff from you will reach a left fork which is signed (not in English). Take this and follow the twisty road to Purandar. At time of writing (October 09) the majority of the road is totally unsurfaced (awaiting surfacing) so would be muddy during rain and there is also the possibility of dealing with the resurfacing activity. Allow 30 minutes to enjoy the views and look at the abandoned army buildings and another 1.5 hours to climb to the top and explore.
</p><p>It will take about 15 minutes to regain the main ro phone=ad if you have a motorbike. Turn left when you reach it and enjoy the smooth tarmac and twists of the road as you pass between the two hills. Eventually you will reach National highway 4 (also a toll road), turn right and again pay attention to the road hazards.
</p><p>Approximately 12km later at Khed take a left turn towards Shivapur. Pass through towards Kondapur, where you take a right fork, thereafter at the T-junction take the left which leads to Sinhagad Fort. 
</p><p>In terms of time to spend here it is best to gauge your stamina and enthusiasm against the amount of light you have left, as it is better to end the journey in daylight rather than drive at night.
</p><p>Retrace your steps to NH4 and then follow this back to Pune. You will arrive in the Bibvewadi area in the south of the city.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Bhuleshwar</b> - a very beautiful 1100 year old hill temple near Yavat in the Saswad region. The patterns and beautiful stone statues inside the temple are stunning. This place is around 60 Km via Saswad- the closest and most beautiful route. This place and the surrounding areas of Saswad are praised by one British General, the Duke of Welligton as “one of the best peaceful place in the Deccan plateau and the region of beautiful temples”</li>
<li><b>Nil Kantheshwar</b></li></ul>
<p>NilKantheshwar hill is situated near Panshet village. One can visit lord shiva temple on top of the hill. You can see many statues and idols of god on top of hill.

<p>Pune is by and large a very safe place. Violent crime is low, although it's important to keep an eye on your belongings in public, as petty theft can occur. Do report any such activity to the police. Keep away from the touts. 
</p><p>Locals are by and large friendly and mild mannered, though incidents of mugging have been reported on the outskirts of Pune, especially on highways and desolate stretches. If you face a vehicle breakdown after dark, its best to stay in the vehicle and phone for help.
</p><p>Driving in Pune is not for the weak-hearted. Like other Indian metros, Pune has seen a virtual explosion in traffic in recent years, and the infrastructure is struggling to keep pace. Lack of discipline especially during overtaking and driving on the wrong side is rampant in the city and on highways. Its common to see rude and impatient drivers at intersections honking away at pedestrians. Enforcement of traffic rules leaves a lot to be desired, unlike Mumbai or other major cities. Road conditions deteriorate especially in heavy traffic areas during monsoon. According to recent reports, during the year 2012 nearly 407 fatalities in road accidents occurred in Pune, and Speeding and rash and negligent driving are the main reasons for the high number of accidents. If you are driving, its a good idea to drive defensively. Be courteous to fellow motorists and maintain lane discipline. Though the helmet rule is not strictly enforced, its always a good idea to wear a helmet while riding a two wheeler.
