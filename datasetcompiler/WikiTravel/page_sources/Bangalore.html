<p><b>Bengaluru</b> (Kannada: ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು), since 2006, also widely known as Bangalore, is the capital of the Indian state of <a href="/en/Karnataka" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>. It is third-largest city in India. 
</p><p>In a recent survey, conducted by the global HR consultancy Mercer, Bangalore was voted the most liveable city in India, beating <a href="/en/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="/en/Chennai" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>, <a href="/en/New_Delhi" class="mw-redirect" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a> and <a href="/en/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>.<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://mobilepaper.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&amp;pageid=37&amp;sectid=edid=&amp;edlabel=TOIBG&amp;mydateHid=07-12-2012&amp;pubname=Times+of+India+-+Bangalore&amp;edname=&amp;articleid=Ar03701&amp;publabel=TOI">[2]</a>.In terms of cleanliness, Bangalore ranks 12th in India.<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://im.rediff.com/news/2010/may/rank-of-cities-on-sanitation-2009-2010.pdf">[3]</a> 
</p><p>Once called the "Garden City of India" and the "Pensioner's Paradise", these epithets no longer apply to Bangalore, which is now a large, cosmopolitan city with diminishing green spaces and a large working population. Bangalore is the major center of India's IT industry, popularly known as the <i>Silicon Valley of India</i>.

<p>The earliest records of a place named 'Bengaluru' are found in a 9th-century temple in an area that is now known as 'Old Bangalore'. 
</p><p>Legend has it that the feudal lord Kempe Gowda was once hunting in this area, a rabbit turned and attacked his dog. This made a great impression on Gowda and he gave the place a title of <i>gandu bhoomi</i> (the place of heroes) and in 1537, with the assistance of the local king, he constructed three districts protected by a walled fort on the site.
</p><p>During the next three centuries, Bangalore existed very much in the shadow of its neighbouring city <a href="/en/Mysore" title="Mysore">Mysore</a>, and control of the town changed hands many times. The year 1831 marked a major turning point for the city. Claiming misrule by the king Krishna Raja Wodeyar III, the British took control of the Mysore Kingdom and, possibly influenced by the city's salubrious climate, moved the administrative capital to Bangalore. New telecommunication systems were laid, rail connections built, fine government buildings constructed, and the city's famous parks and gardens established. After independence, Bangalore maintained its position as the <a href="/en/Karnataka" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> state capital and continues to flourish. 
</p><p>For many years, Bangalore was known throughout India as the greenest, liberal and forward-thinking city. In recent years, these attributes have propelled Bangalore to the forefront of the high-tech industry boom in India, and it currently ranks as India's most developed city and one of the world's fastest-growing urban areas.  
</p><p>The name Bangalore appears to come from an Anglicisation of the native name "Bengaluru" - an adaptation of the earlier name in Kannada: <i>Benda Kaalu Uru</i> (The Town of Boiled Beans). Apparently this rather humble name was bequeathed to the city by King Vira Ballala. Once while lost in the area, he was offered boiled beans by an old woman, and it was out of gratitude that he named the area after this simple offering. This story is questionable however and a more authentic source is the earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru", which was found in a ninth-century Western Ganga Dynasty stone inscription on a "vīra gallu" (ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು) (literally, "hero stone", a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). In this inscription found in Begur, "Bengalūrū" is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890 CE. It states that the place was part of the Ganga Kingdom until 1004 and was known as "Bengaval-uru", the "City of Guards" in Halegannada (Old Kannada).

<p>Unlike other parts of India which are extremely hot in the summer months, Bangalore enjoys a relatively mild climate year-round.
</p>
<ul><li>Summer - February to May (peak temperature is during April and May)</li>
<li>Monsoon - June to October (the heaviest rains are typically between June and August)</li>
<li>Winter - November to January (with December being the coldest month)</li></ul>
<p>Summer temperatures can reach up to 36°C (97°F) and early morning temperatures in the winter hover around 12°C (54°F).
</p><p>Bangalore also witnesses sudden changes in climate during a day. It could be warm and humid during the morning, it might rain in the afternoon and turn out to be windy and cold late in the evening. On the other hand, it could be hot and sultry for a few days in a week and there could be a sudden rain and dip in mercury for the next few days. 
While the weather and these changes, as such, is enjoyable, this also results in the spread of viral infections.

<p>Being the capital of Karnataka, the official language in Bangalore is <b><a href="/en/Kannada_phrasebook" title="Kannada phrasebook">Kannada</a></b>. However, most people are also able to speak Hindi or English. Other Indian languages such as Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Odia, Tulu, and Konkani are spoken by the respective migrant communities.
</p><p>Most retail transactions in the city are conducted in Kannada and English, as are most signs written in English alongside Kannada.
</p><p>Basic Kannada knowledge will come very handy while dealing with work groups like roadside vendors, maids. However most shop owners, auto drivers, bus conductors and utility service providers can converse in basic English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu, if required. The Cantonment and other surrounding localities are predominantly Tamil and you can easily get by speaking in Tamil/English here.
</p><p>To greet in Kannada, say "Namaskara"<br />
To ask, "How are you?" in Kannada, say "Hegidira"<br />
To tell, "I am fine." in Kannada say "Channagidini"<br />
To ask, "How much?" in Kannada say "Eshtu"<br />
To say, "Too pricey" in Kannada say "Tumba Jasthi"<br />
To thank in Kannada, say "Dhanyawada"(This might get you funny looks, you would be better off saying "Thanks")<br />

Sometimes the airport is subject to operational restrictions due to fog from 15 Nov-15 Feb, between 3 AM (IST)- 8:30 AM (IST). Flight delays and diversions may occur on some mornings due to the morning fog. The airport operator has an inquiry number to check on weather related delays. ☎ +91 80 66782255, +91 80 66782251 or call the airline's call center.
</p><p>The airport has an international and a domestic terminal. There are ATMs and foreign currency exchange at the airport. There is a growing number of dining options for the traveler and a good selection of single malt whiskies in the duty-free section.
</p><p>When departing from Bangalore airport, make sure to check restrictions on times for baggage check-in, and make sure to bring a printout of your ticket or boarding pass with you to the airport as you wouldn't be let in otherwise (however showing a ticket on a smartphone works too).  For flights leaving in the early morning hours (such as 3 am) you may need to check bags as much as 2.5 hours in advance.

<ul><li><b>Buses</b> Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC)<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bmtcinfo.com/site/BSBusServicesDetails.jsp?bsserviceid=1">[30]</a> operates buses from various points of the city every 15 min to the Bangalore International Airport (BLR). A total of 156 buses ply to and from the airport. 40 of these buses are air-conditioned Volvo buses, called Vayu Vajra. The cost for each trip in these buses ranges between Rs 50-270 depending on the distance. This is the cheapest and an extremely convenient way to get to the airport moreover, this service is available every day, day and night. While taking this mode be aware that you will need some one to pick you up from the bus stop or you will need an auto rickshaw ride for the last mile.TheBMTC buses are serialled with letter series 'KIAS'. All the KIAS buses pass through Merkhi Circle which is in the city centre next to Induan Airforce Training Command. While,  going from Merkhi Circle to airport you can also find private taxis which take you on sharing basis.  Rental is generally Rs 250 per seat.</li></ul>
<p>Tip: If you are travelling from airport to city in a group of 3 or more, it will be cheaper to call an Uber than taking the airport bus service.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Airport City Taxi</b>These are air conditioned sedans which are licenced by the Airport to primarily provide connectivity between the International Airport to the city. The Taxis are usually Renault Logans or Toyota Etios models and sport a 'Taxi' top-sign for easy identification. Fitted with speed governors and GPS tracked, these are by far the safest and best way to get to the city from the airport. The four companies which run these taxis are <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://vayu.travel/">Vayu Travels</a> (Telephone: +91-971-100-8524), MegaCabs (Telephone: +91-80-47474747; Website: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.megacabs.com/">www.megacabs.com</a>); Meru Cabs (Telephone: +91-80-4422 4422; Website: www.merucabs.com) and the state-run KSTDC (Telephone: +91-80-4466 4466; Website: www.karnatakaholidays.net).Taxis charge according to a standard digital meter at INR 80 for the first 4 kilometres, followed by INR19.50 per kilometre after that. A 10% surcharge is applicable between midnight to 6 AM. A trip from the airport to CBD will cost around INR800-INR900.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Radio Cabs</b> Alternatively you can also take a radio cab. The only thing which you need to hire these cabs is mobile data. If your data is working, you just need to download their mobile app and book the cabs nearby. Most popular radio cab services in Bangalore are Uber and Ola. Their mobile app provides an option of choosing the type of car, which varies from hatchback to sedan and their rates are also quite reasonable in comparison of Airport taxi. Typically it costs from INR 600 to 1000 to reach any location in Bangalore city.</li></ul>
<p>When exiting the passenger terminal building, look for the large sign outside that says 'Airport Taxis' which will point to your left. Follow the sign-age till you see the taxi queue where valets will guide you to your taxi. On the way to the taxi queue, you may be approached by private taxi drivers who will try to get you to take their taxis instead. Ignore these unless you feel you can negotiate a rate cheaper than the airport taxi, and are willing to take the associated risk.
</p><p>As an alternative, if you have an Uber or Ola (a local service similar to Uber) app on your smartphone you can call for a cab using this as well. Note, however, that Uber drivers can't go to the taxi waiting area, they park at parking lots and wait for you to come. Expect a call from a driver shortly after you book an Uber, so make sure your phone is connected. The whole process is slow (took an hour in my case), but saves you a few Rupees.
</p><p>Note that as you exit the Airport Complex, you will have to pay a toll of INR120 to use the expressway to get to the city. This is usually borne by the passenger unless arranged otherwise in advance.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Pre-paid taxi</b> Hertz, Savaari, Carzonrent and Akbar Travels provide pre paid Limousine and car rental facilities through counters at the terminal building. These cost above Rs 1,200 to the CBD.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Self drive cars</b> are available on self-drive basis. There are three ranges of self-drive cars - the compact category (Suzuki Swift), the intermediate range (Ford Fiesta), the standard category (Toyota corolla), Multi Utility Vehicles (Toyota Innova) and Sports Utility Vehicles (Ford Endeavour). These cars will be given to the renter with a full fuel tank and the car has to be returned with full fuel tank. A flexible pick up and drop off facility in town and at the airport will be offered. The renter can pick up the car at the airport and then drop it off anywhere in the city or in Hyderabad or Chennai. Similarly, the car can be picked up at any of these cities and dropped off at the airport. This is a viable option if you have a licence that is valid in India, and if you are confident of driving in India's chaotic traffic. Please check well in advance before making plans.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Hotel pick-up</b> Another option is to arrange with your hotel in Bangalore to have a driver pick you up at the airport. Some hotels, especially the higher-end ones, provide this service for free if you are staying with them. If it's your first time traveling to Bangalore, this is the recommended way to get from the airport to your hotel. The driver will be found outside the airport with a card bearing your name, the only difficulty being that about 100 other drivers will also be waiting outside the airport, all vying for your attention. Luckily there is a short fenced walkway that separates the drivers from those leaving the airport, giving you ample time and space to find your ride into Bangalore.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Taxi (other)</b> You can still find a ride into Bangalore City in your own taxi at a much cheaper rate than the above options, if you are willing to take the risk involved. Taxi drivers not approved by the airport will attempt to negotiate with you a much lower fare than the approved EasyCabs and Meru cabs, and may come down to as much as Rs 200-300 for a ride to Bangalore's CBD. One really has to bargain very hard or you will be taken for a ride. These drivers can be found just beyond the terminal plaza at the covered walkway that leads to the parking lots. Once you leave the walkway, some drivers may become fairly aggressive, and might try to take your bag without your permission. The best thing to do is to keep track of and be in control of, your belongings. Even the most aggressive taxi driver or tout will leave you alone if you stand firm and make it clear that you do not want their help. It is recommended to fix the price before you enter the cab and no tip is necessary once you arrive at your destination. Do not opt for this mode if you are not familiar with rates.</li></ul>

<p>Bangalore has two major railway terminals. The Bangalore City (IR station code: SBC) railway station is situated in the heart of the city, opposite the Majestic Bus stand. Most trains, both local and long-distance, arrive and depart from here. The other terminal is Yeshwantpur Junction (IR station code: YPR) located on NH-4 (Tumkur Road). A few (mostly long-distance) trains arrive and depart from here. Two smaller railway terminals are Bangalore East (IR station code: BNCE) and Bangalore Cantonment (IR station code: BNC).Of late Krishnarajapuram (KJM) has become an important stop owing to proximity of IT companies and the ring road just passing close to the station and well connected by buses to major parts. It also forms the 1st stop for majority trains leaving Yeshvantapur towards Jolarpettai. 
</p><p>Bookings can be done at either the railway stations or at the Indian Railways booking counters located in major commercial residential areas. Booking can also be done online <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.irctc.co.in">[31]</a>. Note that if you are booking at Bangalore City and are traveling to Mysore, there is a separate counter for travelers to Mysore. This is to cater for a large amount of travelers between Bangalore and Mysore. If travelling to Mysore on a Sunday afternoon, arrive early as there is usually a long line for buying tickets.
</p><p>As with all Indian railway travel, have some patience for delays. Trains are usually on time (within 20 mins of scheduled time), but can sometimes be late. A digital departure board in the station will tell you what platform your train is on and what time it leaves.
</p><p>Train travel is usually fairly cheap. For example, a ticket to Chennai, about 360 km (5-6 hr) away, costs anywhere from Rs 125 for the lowest class to Rs 1,105 for the highest class.
</p><p>For train arrival/departure and PNR status inquiries at various railway stations at Bangalore, call 139.
</p><p>Travelling from <a href="/en/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> to Bangalore by train takes a long time (24 hrs or so). Buses are comparatively faster and take 18-20 hrs, provided there are no traffic jams in Mumbai and <a href="/en/Pune" title="Pune">Pune</a> en route. Effective travel time by both train or bus is long. Air travel is recommended for traveling between Mumbai and Bangalore, the duration of which is about 90 min.  Low-cost airlines charge the same fare as A/C train or Volvo bus<i>. However, sleeper class (non-A/C) train travel from Mumbai to Bangalore is economical and you can have a view of some lush evergreen forests and river valleys across Western India.</i>
</p><p>If you arrive at Yeshwantpur Junction, you will need to take a taxi or auto rickshaw to get into the city. The metro stop next to the station is part of the metro's Phase I which is currently operating from Feb 2014 (Operating between Sampige Road to Peenya Industrial Estate Via Yeshwanthpur). At Yeshwantpur Junction, there are exits on 2 sides of the station, both have official auto rickshaw booking counters located out front, and a lot of unofficial taxis waiting for customers (as well as touts all over the station). These taxis will propose fixed rates based on your destination, but at a very elevated cost, for example Rs 600 to get to Indiranagar (14 km). There is a taxi booth operated by a company called Fast Track located in front of the station exit on the side near the metro station. This will be a metered taxi which offers a better rate (about Rs 15-20 per km). You will need to use considerable effort, however, to get to use this service as the minute you exit the station there will be a lot of unofficial taxi drivers storming all over you trying to get you to get into one of their fixed-rate (and more expensive) cars. Even when you approach the Fast Track booth, it is possible that the staff behind the counter may still suggest you to just go for the pre -paid taxis instead. You need to specifically and firmly request that you really want the metered taxi from the booth, in order for them to proceed to provide you one.

<p>If you have difficulty in arranging a plane or railway ticket to your next destination, or you prefer a little more adventure, you can go by bus. There are both government and private buses that run services to major cities like Mumbai, <a href="/en/Goa" title="Goa">Goa</a>, <a href="/en/Chennai" title="Chennai">Chennai</a>, <a href="/en/Mangalore" title="Mangalore">Mangalore</a>, <a href="/en/Coimbatore" title="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a>, <a href="/en/Madurai" title="Madurai">Madurai</a>, <a href="/en/Tirupati" title="Tirupati">Tirupati</a>, <a href="/en/Hyderabad" title="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>, etc. Buses can be a normal luxury bus, a Volvo A/C bus or a sleeper bus for night travel.
</p><p>All intercity buses arrive and depart from Bangalore bus stand, which is located opposite the Bangalore city railway station. The bus station is named after the founder of Bangalore - Kempe Gowda.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Kempegowda Bus Station</b>, is more commonly known as the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation <b>(<i>KSRTC</i>) bus stand</b> or the <b>Majestic Bus Station</b>. It handles buses that connect Bangalore to all major cities and states in south India.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (<i>BMTC</i>)</b>, maintains bus services within Bangalore. The main bus stand is located opposite to the Kempegowda Bus Station.</li></ul>
<p>Unlike other metros, the display boards in the bus show the destination in the local language <b>Kannada</b>. But the bus numbers are mostly in English. If you don't speak Kannada, you will likely need to get some help to get on the right bus. However, the newer Volvo buses are all equipped with electronic displays that display the destination and route numbers in both Kannada and English. Non-Volvo buses are being gradually retrofitted with these electronic displays; this should make bus travel much simpler if you are unfamiliar with the local language.

<p>Besides, those who wish to drive to Goa from Bangalore can take NH 4 and NH 63 that connect both these cities in around 11 to 12 hours drive.
NH7 passes through this city and you can access it from major Indian cities. Driving to Bangalore is a fun experience. There are many car rentals available that offer self drive cars, shared vehicles and rental vehicles. Here are a few of them 
</p><p>Ezycabs 
Ola Outstation
Uber 
Meru 
Zoomcar (self drive)

If you are driving to Bangalore in a car which is registered in another Indian State be wary of RTO checks. Keep toll slips, service records and pollution certificates from your home state to prove that you are only visiting Bangalore for less than 30 days.

<p><b>Buses</b>  in Bangalore are cheap and usually frequent,(though compared to other states the fares are highest here) but traveling on them can be difficult if you don't know the system well. Ordinary city buses display the route number in English and Kannada, with the destination and route information written. You can find the list of bus routes and their route numbers on the BMTC website <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bmtcinfo.com/">[32]</a>, BMTCRoutes.in website <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://bmtcroutes.in/">[33]</a>, Desiroutes <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://narasimhadatta.info">[34]</a> bus routes, List of Metropolitan bus routes in Bangalore <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMTC_routes">[35]</a> or by asking locals. Unlike many Western countries, posted route maps of the bus system are rare, although maps are sold at the main bus terminals (Kempegowda Bus Stand and Shivajinagar). ☎ BMTC toll free 1800 425 1663. <i>Bangalore Bus Route Search</i> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.narasimhadatta.info/bmtc_query.html">[36]</a> also has a webpage with a route number search function.
</p><p>Buses with black display boards run within the city. Red board buses covers long distance and go to adjoining suburbs. The ordinary city buses are white and blue in color. The newer city buses tend to be blue in color (Purchased under the JNNURM fund provided by Central govt. )and have LED display boards. There is a bus service called <b>Pushpak</b> with better seating; these buses are tan rather than the usual blue and are slightly more expensive. There are red Volvo buses, called <b>Vajra</b>, that operate on certain routes within the city. They offer a comfortable air-conditioned ride at slightly higher prices than the regular buses (which are not air-conditioned). These are a great way to get around the city. Unlike most other buses, the Vajras have illuminated LED display boards on the front and sides which display the destination and route information in English as well as Kannada.
</p><p>New bus services are introduced from time to time by the BMTC. The latest service introduced in early 2009 known as <b>Big 10</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://btis.in/big10">[37]</a> consists of ten routes along major roads into the city, bringing passengers from the outer suburbs to central Bangalore. These buses are green in color, have LCD destination boards, and prominently feature the Big 10 logo on the sides. More information about these buses, including stops and route maps. BIG 10 service starts at Brigade road junction.
There are also a couple of buses which do a circular route around the Central Business District. 
</p><p>City buses are crowded during rush hours but one can travel with little difficulty during the daytime. Many have seats reserved for women in the front.Bus service starts around 5:00 AM and ends at around midnight. Bus service is less frequent after 9:30-10 AM and becomes very rare after 1:00 PM and again bus frequency improves after 4:00 PM and continues till midnight.
</p><p>It is always better to buy a daily pass if you plan to travel the whole day on the bus. The daily pass costs Rs Rs 40 as of March 10th, 2011 and it comes handy if you need to travel on several buses in a single day. Daily passes are issued by the on-duty bus conductor or at the bus stand. Using this pass you can travel in any bus (other than the Vajra) for the entire day, any number of times. It is a very economical option for travel in Bangalore. Senior citizens are given 25% concession in all buses on production of valid ID card(Voter ID, PAN, Passport etc). children between the age of 4-12 are given 50% concession. No charge for children up to 4 years of age. For more information on BMTC, you can visit Wikipedia <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore_Metropolitan_Transport_Corporation">[38]</a>
</p><p>There are three major bus stands: 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Kempegowda bus stand</b>, also known as the <b>Majestic Bus Stand</b>, near Gandhi Nagar is directly opposite the Bangalore City railway station. It is quite neatly organized and is easily navigable. There is an inquiry office near platform number 1 on ‘Majestic’ where you can ask the bus number and platform for your desired destination. You can find a large map on display, which you can use to find the bus number you need to take if you know the area you are going to. You can of course always ask the conductor or other passengers. Route maps are also sold on the platforms.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>City Market</b> or <b>K R Market</b> is around 2 km (1.2 mi) to 3 km (1.8 mi) away from Majestic and could daunt newcomers since it is very disorganized. It is a large dirt parking lot under an overhead highway, and there isn't much order to where buses park.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Shivajinagar</b> is in the north. This is also neatly organized and there is an inquiry window to find about buses. You can find a large map on display here too, which you can use to find the bus number you need to take if you know the area you are going to.  Route maps are also sold on the platforms.</li></ul>
<p>Buses are available to all major localities of the city from these three bus stands. There have been a lot of developments due to the ongoing metro project as well as efforts to decongest the city. BMTC is adding more bus stations all the time. Better to check on their website for latest situation.  
</p><p>Other important bus stands are:
</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Autorickshaws and taxis in Bangalore have a metered fare system, but it is never used. Always ask a local the actual price that is reasonable and make sure to negotiate the price if it is high, as almost every auto driver overcharges in the beginning. You are the most vulnerable person to them if you are a foreigner.

<p>There are three types of taxi services operational in Bangalore.
</p>
<ul><li>Airport City Taxis: These are air conditioned sedans which are licenced by the Airport to primarily provide connectivity between the International Airport to the city. Although you can board these at the taxi queue at the airport, or occasionally hail them from the street, the most common way to use such a taxi is to make an advance booking. This is accomplished either by contacting the call centre of the airport taxi company, or by making an online booking. The Taxis are usually Renault Logans or Toyota Etios models and sport a 'Taxi' top-sign for easy identification. Fitted with speed governors and GPS tracked, these are by far the safest and best way to get around the city. The three companies which run these taxis are</li></ul>
<p><b>MegaCabs</b> (Telephone: +91-80-47474747; Website: www.megacabs.com)
</p><p><b>Meru Cabs</b> (Telephone: +91-80-4422 4422; Website: www.merucabs.com)

</p><p>Do note that these fleets are not particularly large, and while you can easily book a taxi to get to the airport, trips that do not involve the airport run (and which are for short distances) may get cancelled during peak hours. Taxis charge according to a standard digital meter at INR 80 for the first 4 kilometres, followed by INR19.50 per kilometre after that. A 10% surcharge is applicable between midnight to 6 AM. A trip from the airport to CBD will cost around INR800-INR900.
</p>
<ul><li>Taxi Aggregators: The most common taxi service in Bangalore is <b>Uber</b>, along with a similar local service called <b>Ola</b>. Both can be operated by using a smartphone app that uses the phone GPS to locate your position and direct the nearest taxi to you. Both aggregators operate substantially large fleets, so a taxi can usually be hailed from anywhere within the city within 10-15 minutes at the maximum. While Uber in Bangalore can be operated through its international app, Ola also allows taxis to be booked through a call centre in addition to its app. Visit uber.com and olacabs.com.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Private Taxis: Travel agents and hotels can arrange private chauffeur driven cars to provide services. Expensive by comparison with Uber or Ola cabs, they are a most trusted, secure, and comfortable way to travel around the city. These can be arranged by travel companies or online from the countries of origin.</li></ul>

<p>As compared to Uber and Ola cabs, three wheeled auto rickshaws (similar to tuk-tuks in other countries) are cheaper for very short distances, and can be convenient when cabs are not available. Ola has started their own Ola-auto service which can be booked by using the same app by tapping the "Auto" option in the bottom dashboard. These autos have an "Ola" sticker on their side and work as an alternative to their cab service, though they operate in the same way as Ola's cabs do.
</p><p>Auto-rickshaws are everywhere at most hours. They are green-and-yellow, or black-and-yellow three-wheeled contraptions. They are a fast way to get around the city.
</p><p>Auto-rickshaws are supposed to charge fares as per the meter reading, which most often equals to Rs 15 x distance (in kilometres) (Minimum charge of Rs 25 for the first 1.8 km or less, with a 1.5x surge between 9 PM and 6 AM), they generally tend to charge on an ad-hoc basis depending on the distance of the destination, the chances of getting another customer from the mentioned locality, and their mood. 
</p><p>Usually, when hailed from the street, chances are that you can often come across an honest driver who agrees to use a meter without fuss. In the case where the meter is faulty or the driver refuses to use it, you should simply refuse to board. Saying "meter please" will usually do the trick. It gets more tricky when you are in front a big tourist attraction or transportation hub, as there will be hordes of auto-rickshaws waiting around who will try all they can to force you to use their service. Most of these drivers will refuse to use meter and ask for an exorbitantly overpriced rate. You should simply and firmly refuse them and walk away until you find an auto who agrees to use a meter. If this is not practical or you are simply too tired to deal with it or are in a hurry, counter-propose them an appropriate amount based on the distance of your destination. The driver will be likely to insist on his own price. Just walk away and chances are that he will give up and agree on your price faster than you thought. 
</p><p>Tourists should be cautious when approaching an auto-rickshaw during night, or during heavy rains. Chances are they will charge exorbitant rates. Help could be taken from the local traffic police to avail auto-rickshaws during such circumstances. If you are a visitor and do not know the route to the destination it is a good idea to bargain and fix the fare before boarding to avoid long, convoluted routes being used by the driver.
</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is to be firm but not loud in an argument while travelling in the auto. Some of the less reputable drivers may team up with their friends midway to cause problems. Remember that although Bangaloreans are known for their polite and mild mannered behavior, auto drivers are normally an exception. Some will think nothing of trying to rip you off. If in doubt, consult a local or your hotel travel desk. 
</p><p>If a rickshaw driver offers to show/drive you to some great places to shop, firmly refuse.  A common tactic is to drive you to local shops where you will be pressured to buy Indian crafts that you probably don't want.  Know your destination and insist upon it. Be firm.
</p><p>Autos add a 50% surcharge after 10 PM (called "one and a half" and is the legal charge). Some drivers may demand 100% surcharge after 10 PM or 11 PM but you must refuse to board in such a case. Heavy luggage costs an additional fee of around Rs 10-20.
</p><p>Rickshaw drivers are required by law to display their identification on the dashboard or the back of their seats. Refuse to get into a rickshaw that does not display one.
</p><p>If an auto driver is problematic, note their identification number and report to the BBMP(Greater Bangalore Municipal Corporation) Control room which is empowered to withdraw their auto license. This is a very effective technique to deal with them. The BBMP control room number as of December 2009 is ☎+91 80 22975803.
</p><p>The minimum charge as of October 2015, is Rs 25 for the first 1.8 km and Rs 12 for every additional kilometer.
</p><p>There is a new call an auto service started in Bangalore called Autowale, the number for that is  080-50661111
</p><p>If you arrive in Bangalore via train, at the main train station there is an office near the taxis/auto-rickshaws which will print-out a pre-paid receipt for your ride.  The service costs 1 Rs, but will save you a potentially large amount of money by giving you an accurate value for your ride.  This also allows you to avoid haggling with the driver and acts as an official price agreement in the event that the driver wants to dispute the price of the ride.

<p>Most taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers will be more than happy to offer you either a daily rate or an hourly rate, and take you around wherever you need to go. Alternately, your hotel or a travel company can arrange a private car. 
</p><p>If you find a good taxi or auto driver, this can be a great way to go for a foreigner. You'll certainly pay a lot more than if you bought individual rides, but you'll always have a driver waiting for you, and he can help with recommending local tourist sites, finding a good restaurant to eat at, and otherwise coping with day-to-day life. This can take a lot of the stress out of traveling.
</p><p>Rates are generally something like Rs 50 to 100 per hour for an auto-rickshaw and Rs 150 to 250 per hour for a taxi. Rates for a private car booked via the hotel will probably be more. Like everything else in India, rates are very fluid.

<p>Although Bangalore is not known as a tourist city, there is still a lot to see. If you only have a limited amount of time in the city, you should consider taking a tour.
</p><p>Typically, the city tours do <b>NOT</b> include entry fees into the attractions. Bangalore, as with the rest of India, has a habit of charging foreigners a lot more than locals. For example, Tipu Sultan's Palace, which is on the half-day tour, charges Rs 10 for Indians and Rs 100 (or US$2) to non-Indians.

<p><b>Non-Indian Citizen Employment Regulation</b><br />
Indian regulations may require that any foreign national who is employed in India earn at least US$25,000/year. This is exempted for (a) Ethnic chefs, (b) Language teachers (other than English language teachers)/translators and (c) Staff working for Embassy/High Commissions. Check your compensation offer so that you meet this requirement and are eligible for an employment visa.  Some foreign nationals are employed at salaries less than this, though, typically in the NGO sector.

With a little hard work and persistence finding a job is quite possible in Bangalore. Most of the available positions are in the IT field but not necessarily IT based. Several expats do marketing, quality assurance, accent training and translation among other things. All jobs in India require an employment visa which must be obtained abroad and sponsored by the hiring company in India. In general, the salary for expats is very high compared to the local Indian wage. The best resource for jobs is through the expat community. Ask around but a good place to meet expats is the Sunday brunches at the 5 Star hotels or at the numerous coffee shops in and around the MG Road area.

<p>For Non-Indians. 
</p><p>You will not find money exchange kiosks/counters in all parts of Bangalore because Bangalore is not a primary destination for most foreign tourists, nor is it the entry point for most tourists entering the region. However, most banks offer currency exchange in all their branch offices as do some travel agencies, many of these exchanges are found near the main IT parks, business and shopping areas including MG Road and Brigade Road. Exchange rates can vary somewhat even on the same day, so it is advisable to shop around. Typically, travel agencies will offer a better exchange rate as compared to the rates offered by banks.

<p>Bangalore provides a wide range of options for shoppers. One can buy many things ranging from clothing to electronic goods and vehicles. Being an IT city, Bangalore provides all kind of services but one might find things to be costlier.
</p><p>Many visitors come to Bangalore searching only for sandalwood carvings and silk saris and so miss out on the true Bangalore shopping experience. Here is a low down on shopping - Bangalore's style:
</p><p>The <b>UB City</b> and <b>Vittal Mallya Road</b> are Page-3 shopping areas. You'll find brands like Versace, Louis Vuitton, Kimaya in the UB City. Vittal Mallya Road's got shopping places like <b>The Collective</b> which is a shop only for men! Armani, Versace, Boss, you name it they have it. There's even Canary Blue and Esprit on the same road.
</p><p>The <b>M.G Road/Brigade Road</b> area is the most popular place for tourists, and these two roads are filled with shops of every kind, whether it be traditional handicrafts or the latest western wear (this is especially true for Brigade Road).
Brigade Road used to be where British soldiers bought their necessities. Today Brigade Road is the center of yuppie Bangalore; you'll see hordes of college students on the road anytime of day or night. Some of the stores on Brigade Road include Planet M (a huge music store with everything), Tommy Hilfiger, Louis Philippe, Pepe Jeans, Levis, Lee, San Frisco Jeans, Nike, Titan (great Indian made watches) just to name a few.
</p><p><b>Bannerghatta Road</b>, newly improved. You have 'Grasshopper,' a space that exhibits clothing designs from the most experimental designers in India and also showcases other ideas - lighting design, products, theater, music - an open space for expression! If that's too boring, you can keep driving and you have a thousand ways that you can take to enjoy the wildlife and the myriad reservoirs strewn across the area - you can still find your very own private haven. Enjoy
</p><p><b>Wood Street</b> in the heart of the city you have 'Eternal Expression' <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tattoobangalore.com">[66]</a> Bangalore`s best Tattoo Studio, 'Monkey Bar' <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mobar.in">[67]</a> among Bangalore`s best bars and first gastropub of India. 'Olive Beach' <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://http://olivebarandkitchen.com/">[68]</a>the finest Mediterranean dining experience.
</p><p>There are also many eateries on the road and on the side roads that lead off of Brigade road, so that you can refuel yourself for shopping. There are your fast food outlets: KFC (right at the entrance), Pizza Hut at the other end of the road and many cafes including the Indian Coffee Chain Cafe Coffee Day. Also, includes a tattoo studio. 
</p><p><b>Commercial Street</b> a legacy of the British is another shopping mecca that sells international brands (similar to Brigade road) alongside locally produced items. Commercial Street has more of a bazaar feel than Brigade Road. In addition, it is famous for its body piercing centers. The price of goods here is very competitive and it is a great place to pick a bargain.
</p><p><b>KR Market (or City Market)</b> is one of the largest wholesale markets for Bangalore. The market itself, as well as the surrounding streets, are full of stalls and small shops where you can find almost anything: flowers, fresh fruit and vegetables, sarees and other clothes, tools of all kinds, pooja items, etc. It's usually very crowded, but it's absolutely worth it. The colors, the sounds, the smells (good and bad) all make for a very intense experience perfect for the adventurous traveller.

<p>Go <b>shopping</b> at one of Bangalore's many malls and traditional markets. Malls typically have high(er)-end stores retailing apparel, footwear, and consumer electronics. Many malls also have food courts (with international cuisine) and movie theaters. Finding a parking spot for your car may not be easy though, especially on weekends. Some of the more popular malls in Bangalore are: 
</p>

<p>And counting...
<b>Malls</b> in India is a recent phenomenon, the first opened back in 1999. Since then there has been a boom with malls around every corner in large cities (now also in smaller cities). Bangalore is no exception. Here is a list of the major malls in Bangalore. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Forum Mall</b> - The Forum on Hosur road is in the upmarket suburb of Koramangla, fast becoming a key shopping hub in Bangalore (Bannerghatta Road). It is the largest mall in Bangalore , covering an area of 650 000 ft² (60 000m²) of retail space.  Again like other shopping areas, you can find anything at the Forum, high international brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Swarovski Crystals to traditional Indian Khadi clothing at the Khadder. Other brands with outlets include: United Colors of Benetton (much cheaper here than in the west), Pepe Jeans U.K, William Penn, Wrangler Jeans, Weekender and of course Nike. The Forum incorporates the clothing from international brands as well as haute couture boutiques including: Mustard, Isis, B and the Chai shop. For books head straight to Landmark and huge store has everything from books to perfumes and music. On the top floor of the mall you will find a PVR multiplex comprising 11 cinemas. For eating there is everything, Fast food (KFC, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Subway) Cafe Coffee Day and a food court with world cuisines including: Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican and Italian and Indian. Not to be missed is the Indian cuisine at Sahib Sindh Sultan and the British style pub, Firangi Pani. So that is a forum for all your shopping needs under one roof. Its just a must see, especially the outside.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Garuda Mall</b> - Located on the corner of McGrath and Commissariat Roads, is the newest and the second largest mall in Bangalore .</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bangalore  Central</b> - Opened around the same as the Forum, Bangalore  Central is more of a large department store than a mall with separate retailers.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Safina Plaza</b> - The sale capital of Bangalore, located on Infantry Road. Every week there is sale going on of any type. One week it might be home furnishings and the next men's wear. Good place to find some bargains. Many exhibitions are also held here, although there are retailers (Dockers, Lee Jeans, Titan too name a few) here too. So for quiet shopping come here (much less crowded than the other malls). It's best to visit during end of season sales (Summer, Monsoon) or during festivals (Ganesha Chaturthi, Diwali, New Year, Christmas, ).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Lifestyle</b> - A two-story store on Victoria Road in the heart of the new mall shopping district with malls like Garuda Mall, Bangalore Central and Globus, all within easy walking distance and was one of the most coveted stores until the malls came along. It's an easy place to go shopping when you don't want too many options to confuse you or when you're tired and don't want to visit too many shops - you can get everything under one roof here. Good for clothes, cosmetics, watches, jewelry, shoes etc. You also get stylish furniture and other home and living items for a decent price.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Mantri Square</b> - It is located in Malleswaram.</li></ul>
<p><b>Sampige Road, Malleswaram</b> - Sampige Road is the heart of Malleswaram and connects Sheshadripuram to Indian Institute Science. Sampige Road is around 2 km, has a wide range of shops that sells books, electronic items, silk sarees, handicrafts, cloth materials, Hindu pooja materials, sweets and all the trivial things you can buy on earth. Also try Malleswaram 8th cross on Sampige road (aptly named Brigade Road of Malleswram) for a vibrant shopping experience. Sampige Road is also home to best flower market and fruits market in Bangalore. If you are tired of going to individual shops you can go for the best departmental stores in Bangalore like Fabmall, Foodworld and Nilgiris.
</p><p><b>Marathahalli Main Road and Factory Outlets</b>- Located a distance from central Bangalore (although not difficult to reach), is Marathahalli (a village in a previous life). The main road of this suburb is now a haven for factory outlets for all major brands: Nike, Adidas, Pepe Jeans, Killer Jeans, Louis Philippe, Levi's, Reebok etc. You can expect prices here to be cheaper than in the Malls, at least 20-30% price difference but can be up to 50% cheaper when it comes to some of the major denim brands. As if India wasn't cheap enough. Although this is the best place to go to for factory outlet shopping, there are smaller factory outlets scattered across the city. Also look out for sales held by the major brands to get rid of end of season stock (again end of Summer or end of Monsoon), these are usually advertised in newspapers or look for signs posted on major roads.
</p><p><b>Metro shopping mall</b>, (<i>near Yeshwanthpur railway station and ISKON temple</i>).
</p><p><b>Jayanagar Shopping Complex</b>, From antique jewelry (the famous Bhavani's, the more recent Kushal's, The Gallery), the authentic gold jewelry stores, saree stores (Kalamandir, Kalaniketan, Mysore Silk Udyog), sweet meat stores (Sri Krishna Sweets, Arya Bhavan), Classic Iyengar bakeries, dress stores (Paridhan, Rangoli, Bafna's, Vinayaka Collections), through to fresh vegetables, fruits, meat and butter.
</p><p><b>Gandhi Bazaar</b>,  (<i>in the heart of Basavangudi</i>). One of the oldest shopping areas in Bangalore, Gandhi Bazaar stretches for a short kilometer or so, bordered on both sides by shops selling everything from saris and clothes to plastics and kitchen utensils, fronted by vegetable and fruit stalls. Do not forget to visit <i>Vidyarthi Bhavan</i> whenever you come here for this is the best South Indian restaurant in Bangalore selling the most heavenly dosas.
</p><p>Apart from the malls one should not forget to visit Commercial Street and Brigade Road, which are excellent shopping and hanging out places.
</p><p>The traditional markets have mom-and-pop stores that sell everything from fruits, vegetables, groceries to electronics, music, and mobile phones. The city's largest vegetable and fruit market is in the heart of the city and is called "KR Market" or "City Market". Smaller but more lively traditional markets can be found in residential areas such as Gandhi Bazaar, N R Colony, Banashankari, Malleswaram, Jayanagar, and JP Nagar &amp; Shivajinagar.
For people looking for girls party wear dresses Magic Threads in Richmond town, very close to the popular shopping area of Brigade Road, is a must visit.

</p><p>Bangalore is far from the sea, and as such the quality of seafood can vary. Some of the higher end and popular seafood places 
manage this well, but foreign travelers may want to tread a bit carefully.

<p>Bangalore literally has hundreds of fast food joints serving South Indian vegetarian food. They usually are identified with small round steel tables and diners standing around them having food. Dosas, idlis, vadas, curd rice, pulao, rice with sambar, lemon rice are usually standard fare. Quality varies widely since many of them cater to the lower working classes.

<ul><li>There are few Dhabas catering to all tastes. Both South and North Indian fare is available at most places and is clean and cheap. A special mention is the green park dhaba on the outskirts on Bellary Road and Golconda Chimney on the old airport road in Marthahalli , opposite Shankara Eye Hospital. Golconda Chimmney has been recently renovated and has both A/c and non-A/C sections, the non-veg spread is simply amazing , but the rates are steep if you have a traditional dhaba in mind. The ambience is nice. Try the chicken kathi rolls and the biryani.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bobby-da-Dhaba</b>, (<i>near Ulsoor Lake. Take a left turn from MG Road - Trinity Circle and ask for Gurudwara the Sikh temple</i>). Right next to the Gurudwara is Bobby-da-Dhaba. The food is quite good (albeit slightly oily). It basically serves paranthas (with lots of butter), chaach, kheer and a number of side dishes (most notable being their shahi paneer and rajma). You may have to wait for a while in case it is full. So it's better to go slightly early, 12PM for lunch and 7:30PM for dinner to avoid rush).</li></ul>

As of November 2014, there is an almost 20% tax on advertised room tariffs in Bangalore (12% Luxury Tax plus 7.42% Service Tax), which means that what lists as a $20 hotel room will actually cost you $24.  Be aware if you bargain the hotel may wave the tax altogether; other discounts may be applied for weekly rates, as well as payment in advance.

<ul><li><b>Others around Majestic</b>, If you are free for an hour, you can just go around the Majestic theatre and the Kempe Gowda Bus Station and look for a budget hotel yourself, as there are many on small streets and roads around this place.  Or, you can even trust (to some extent) a broker who voluntarily offers help, but be sure you take a good look at the rooms before you pay any money to the lodge and the broker.  But there is a wrong notion in the minds of people in and around Majestic that whenever you go in pairs, they tend to look at you with a wrong and suspicious look. If coming with family, especially newly married, avoid the Majestic area.</li></ul>

<p>Bangalore is a relatively safe city during day time. However, most of Bangalore practically shuts down a little before midnight - even very safe residential areas can be very desolate by 11 PM. 
</p><p>Some of the lower-income areas can be somewhat unsafe once it gets dark. Exercising caution and good sense will increase your chances of staying safe.
</p>
<ul><li>It is not advisable to walk alone along deserted alleyways or lanes after dark. Avoid doing so in areas that you are not sure are reasonably safe</li>
<li>Avoid using an auto rickshaw if the driver is not alone, especially at night</li>
<li>Do not flaunt jewelry, high-end mobile phones/laptops, watches, etc.</li>
<li>Do not withdraw large amounts of cash from ATMs in deserted areas</li>
<li>Beware of pickpockets in crowded areas such as exhibitions, cricket matches, etc.</li>
<li>If you are returning late from a party, it is advisable to pre-book cabs through reputed companies such as Ola or Uber as against flagging down an auto rickshaw on the road</li>
<li>Exercise caution in stopping to help if you see a broken-down vehicle at night, especially in lonely streets and in cases where you will be outnumbered</li></ul>
<p>Rising prosperity in the city has brought an influx of people, including both white and blue-collar immigrants, leading to disparities in earnings between locals, the casual labour immigrants and expatriates (people from other parts of the state and also from other countries). This arguably has resulted in a substantial increase in crime rates. Crimes against women have also increased. 
</p><p>One of the frequent crimes encountered in Bangalore, is a group of 4 to 5 men abduct a lonely individual, take his ATM cards, force him to give his ATM PIN. While one goes to withdraw money, others hold back the individual. Hence don't carry too many ATM cards in your wallet. Carry one card, that has limited balance in it. 
</p><p>Though Bangalore offers you a pleasant climate throughout the year to walk around the city, one would have to exercise caution.
One will have to walk on footpaths (if exists) that would be encroached by the vendors, there could be open drains as well. Also, be ready to face a two-wheeler speeding towards you or if one honks behind you, while you are walking on the footpath. Crossing the roads can be a nightmare as well. If you are pedestrian, don't expect the traffic to respect you.
A recent survey (Oct-2015) says that Karnataka has the third-highest road fatalities in India, with Bangalore contributing to most of it. Pedestrians and two wheeler riders are the ones to meet fate usually.

<p>The area code for Bangalore  is 080. When calling from overseas, dial +91 80 XXXX XXXX. If you don’t have an Indian phone number, it is strongly recommended that you get a  pre-paid calling card if you plan on using your phone frequently. Because of new government regulations, you need a photocopy of your passport (visa and the ID pages), a color photo, and proof of local address (in Bangalore ) when buying a pre-paid card. If you do not have the required paperwork, it is recommended that you ask a local friend to buy a pre-paid card on your behalf. Pre-paid cards are sold in a few of the shops that sell mobile equipment.The banglore <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://banksifsccode.com/icici-bank-ltd-ifsc-code/">IFSC Code OF ICICI Bank</a> is available for all Branches located in banglore. 
</p><p>Public telephones are a good option and are available widely. Most shops that offer public phones sport easily visible "STD/ISD/PCO" signages. More often than not, public pay-phones are post-pay and there will be a person at the shop to take the payments. Check the bill generated from the machine and make the payment accordingly. Payments are always in Indian rupees.

<p>Bengaluru is a clean city (compared to other major metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai). Mass epidemics are rare. However, foreign tourists should be cautious about consuming water &amp; eating at open-air eateries. It is recommended to use mosquito repellents after dark, present either as a cream applied on the skin or in electronic form. 
</p><p>Rising air and noise pollution, have been a cause for concern in Bengaluru due to the number of vehicles on the road. With many flowering trees around the city, the pollen count can get high. Vehicle emissions and pollen, when combined with the weather, is known to cause allergy in the breathing cavity. This leads to sneezing, common cold and fever. People with pre-existing breathing conditions, like asthma, are suggested to keep prescribed medication handy.

<p>Cell phone coverage in the city is excellent. There are many service providers offering a wide variety of plans. 
If you are planning on travelling around outside the metropolitan area it might be a good idea to buy a cell phone and use one of the pre-paid plans to get yourself connected whilst you are still in the city. 4G connectivity is superb all along the city.
