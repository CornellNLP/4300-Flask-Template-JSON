<p>In 1884, the Qing dynasty governor of Taiwan, Liu Mingchuan, decided to move the prefecture capital to Taipei, and with the construction of government offices and the influx of civil servants, Taipei's days as a sleepy market town were over. Taipei remained the provincial capital when Taiwan was granted provincial status in 1885. As Taipei is in the north of Taiwan (the closest area to Japan), the city continued to thrive when Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895. However, as Japan was in the throes of a 'modernize-come-what-may' period, little regard was paid to Taipei's traditional Chinese-style architecture and many of the old buildings, including the city walls, were demolished. On the other hand, several European-style buildings were constructed by the Japanese rulers - the Presidential Palace and National Taiwan University being among the most famous. The city's architecture, however, suffered another major onslaught when the KMT government arrived from mainland China in 1945. 
</p><p>To cope with the influx of millions of mainland refugees, temporary housing estates sprang up all around the city. Later, these were replaced by Soviet-era-style (or 'no-style') concrete apartment buildings. These buildings characterized Taipei's landscape until very recently.
</p><p>In the 1980s, Taiwan's economy began to take off. Wages increased and in order to satisfy a wealthy and sophisticated market, Taipei began to change. Wide, tree-lined boulevards were laid, high-quality apartment blocks constructed and stylish restaurants and cafes established. The city was booming and has never looked back since. 
</p><p>The Taipei of today is a confident city of about 2.5 million inhabitants (about seven million including suburbs) and is characterized by its friendly people and safe streets. While it is not usually high on the list of tourist destinations, it is a fascinating place to visit and live. Furthermore, despite its size, Taipei does not have any rough areas that are considered unsafe, even at night - which in itself is attractive.
</p><p>The downtown area is culturally divided into East and West. The West side, with its narrow streets and roadside vendors, is considered the bastion of old Taipei life, whereas East Taipei, with its classy malls, chic boutiques, and stylish restaurants and cafes, reminiscent of those found in Tokyo, Paris or New York represents the city's metamorphosis into a modern and international city.

<p>Taipei has a humid subtropical climate that is heavily influenced by the east asian monsoon. Winters are damp but pleasantly warm with temperatures between 20°C (68°F) and 13-14°C (56-57°F). When the island is hit by a cold snap, Taipei is more affected than <a href="/en/Taichung" title="Taichung">Taichung</a> or <a href="/en/Tainan" title="Tainan">Tainan</a>. Below 5°C (42°F) readings however are very rare and the lowest temperature ever recorded is -0.2°C (31.6°F) in the northern suburbs close to the Yangmingshan National Park. Snow has never fallen in the city but has occurred numerous times in the surrounding mountains. Summers are hot and with excessive amounts of rainfall. Daytime highs usually hover around 35°C (95°F) and nighttime lows around 25°C (75°F). The record high is 39°C (102°F). The monsoon arrives in Taiwan in May and leaves in September. This part of the year accounts for more than 70% of the yearly rainfall and the heaviest is in September when a total of more than 350 milimeters (14 inches). Taiwan is in the path of typhoons and at least 2 of them strike the island each year with varying intensity.

<p>Taipei's primary international airport is officially named <b>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english">[4]</a> (台灣桃園國際機場) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>TPE</b>). However, the name was changed only in 2006 and the old name,  <b>Chiang Kai Shek International Airport</b> (often abbreviated as <b>CKS</b>), is still sometimes used. Most flights are to/from Taoyuan instead of the smaller Songshan Airport located in central Taipei. The airport is located about 30 km from the city and freeway buses ply the route, picking up and dropping off passengers at most of the five star hotels. It also stops at the Taipei Main Station and Songshan Airport. There are also bus services connecting the airport to nearby cities and <a href="/en/Taichung" title="Taichung">Taichung</a> in central Taiwan. Travelers to other destinations need to transfer in Taichung, Taipei or elsewhere.
</p><p>There are five transportation options at the airport: MRT, bus, <b>AirPoPo:Taoyuan Airport Shuttle</b>, taxi, and pre-arranged sedan. Details are below:
</p><p>The <b>Taoyuan Airport MRT</b> line is the only rail line that connects the airport to the city (Taipei Main Station) directly. It is the most reliable option, and is somewhat faster than others. Two trains run every 15 minutes between 6:00 to 23:00, one Express and one Commuter. The trip length is 37 minutes from Terminal 2 to Taipei by Express. Single-trip fares to Taipei for both train types are NT$160. One can buy a single ticket at the station from the kiosk, or use a rechargeable IC card. At the airport terminal, the station is located in the underground levels. Note that <b>eating and drinking is prohibited</b> past the fare gates.
</p><p>From the city, travel to Taipei Main Station to take the Taoyuan Airport MRT to the airport. A less commonly known alternative is you can take train to Beimen Station on the Green Line; Beimen Station has a fully sheltered linkway 5 mins walk to Taipei Main Station and you can take the Taoyuan Airport MRT from there.
</p><p>At Taipei Main Station, certain airlines (currently only China Airlines, EVA Air and their subsidiaries) provide in-town check-in services, with baggage check-in. However, you must do this at least 3 hours before flight departure. Follow the signs for “In-Town Check-in” on the upper levels of the Taipei Main Airport MRT station.
</p><p><b>Express airport buses</b> cost between NT$120 and NT$150 depending on the bus company, and there are stops at both terminals. Most Taipei routes are divided into West and East, with each company operating a service every ten to fifteen minutes on each route. The most common route is the <b>Kuo Kuang 1819</b> which costs NT$140 each way . An advantage of this route over the Airport MRT is that the stop in Taipei is much closer to the Taipei MRT station. These buses run 24 hours a day and depart every 15-20 minutes. The airport bus ticket counter was open at 2 AM. 
</p><p>The western line bus terminates at Taipei Main Railway Station and also makes a stop at Yuanshan MRT Station on the  Tamsui Line (Red Line) (NB: The Airbus company buses on the western line meander through local towns before joining the freeway and therefore take much longer than the blue and white Guoguang buses which enter the freeway directly). Buses plying the eastern route terminate at the Taipei Grand Hyatt Hotel and make a stop at Zhongxiao-Fuxing MRT Station on the Nangang and Muzha lines. There is also a bus connecting to the domestic Songshan Airport. Ticket counters display route maps showing all stops.   
</p><p>In addition, there are some <b>non-express buses</b> which are slightly cheaper, but pass through towns such as Taoyuan (桃園), Nankan (南崁) or Kueishan (龜山) before arriving in Taipei. 
</p><p>When returning to the airport, express buses can be caught at various stops throughout the city. One major one leaves every 15-20 minutes from Taipei West Bus Station adjacent to Taipei Main Railway Station (near MRT exit M5 and underground mall exits K12 and Z3). Another is at the terminal at the Songshan Domestic Airport (松山機場). Other stops are outside major hotels and also in front of Minsheng MRT Station. For people taking early morning flights, the earliest available buses to the airport leave at around 4AM from the Far Eastern Plaza Hotel (台北遠東國際大飯店) (201 Dunhua South Rd Section 2). Be sure to prepare change for the bus fare as change will not be given for tickets purchased directly on the bus. 
</p><p>It is also easy to get from the airport to <b>Taoyuan High Speed Rail station</b> by Airport MRT or by bus. Both services have a headway of 15 mins, and cost NT$35, and NT$30 respectively. From there, you can catch one of the HSR trains to Taipei. These options cost NT$195~200 and take at least 37 mins, therefore likely to fall out of favor for those traveling to Taipei Main, but could remain viable for those going to Banqiao or elsewhere.
</p><p><b>Airport shuttle</b> is a nice service for you if you want to get to Taipei in a comfortable and cheaper way without dragging your luggage around. The airport shuttle provides door-to-door service to all hotels in Taipei City. You can book seats in advance with mobile APP. The price is about NT$350 per person, and has discounts for additional passengers. The most famous airport shuttle in Taiwan now is <b>AirPoPo:Taoyuan Airport Transportation</b>. It also provides private-ride service which costs from NT$699 per car.
</p><p>A one-way <b>taxi</b> fare between the airport and Taipei will cost at the minimum NT$900 (generally NT$1000-$1200 from the airport). In Taipei, don't make the mistake of asking a taxi driver to take you to the Taipei airport (Songshan) if you actually mean Taiwan Taoyuan Airport. The international airport is actually about an hour's drive from Taipei, while Songshan is in downtown Taipei.
</p><p>A one-way <b>pre-arranged sedan</b> fare between the airport and Taipei will cost at the minimum NT$1300-$1500. Generally these sedans are pre-arranged through your hotel and the sedan company or driver will meet you as soon as you exit baggage claim. Since the price is not much more than taking a taxi, it is usually recommended that you ask your hotel if they offer this service. This is a more comfortable half-hour ride to the hotel.
</p><p>Direct <b>bus connections</b> between the airport and other cities in Taiwan are also available.  U-bus also runs shuttle buses every 15 min from both terminals to THSR Taoyuan station (15 min away), from where you can continue your journey by high-speed train.
</p><p>In addition to the transit hotel within the airport terminal, there are several hotels located near the airport if you desire more comfortable quarters for an extended transit or for some other reason would rather lodge by the airport than in Taipei. The Novotel Taoyuan International Airport, located next to the China Airlines headquarters building, is mere minutes from both terminals and has commanding views of the airport's runways. Also nearby is the <b>CitySuites Gateway Hotel</b>, 10 minutes from the Cing-pu High-speed Rail Station and three minutes away from Taoyuan International Airport. 
</p><p><b>Night sevice</b>
There is, although it's really hard to find information about it. Best source is the airport website <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=100150">[5]</a>. Ticket is purchased from the driver as the ticket counter will be closed - 165 NT$. <i>Unconfirmed - one extra departs at 04:00, Wednesday &amp; Saturday at Terminal 2 Without Detouring Terminal 1.</i> From the Taipei Railway you can take overnight train to connect to other cities or bus from the adherent bus station. It takes about 55 min from the airport to the city (at night).

<p>Songshan Airport (松山機場) at the northern end of Dunhua North Rd is the city's domestic airport, as well as serving a few select international routes to regional destinations. There are numerous daily flights arriving and departing for all major cities on the island and the outlying islands. The airport also serves flights to mainland China, Gimpo International Airport in Seoul, South Korea, and Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, Japan.  The airport is served by the Metro Brown Line's (officially labeled the Wenshan-Neihu Line) Songshan Airport Station and can be reached in about 20 minutes from the city's main railway station.

<p>All inter-city trains <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.railway.gov.tw/en/index/index.aspx">[6]</a>, including those operated by the Taiwan High Speed Rail (台灣高鐵) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thsrc.com.tw/en/index.htm">[7]</a>, arrive at and depart from Taipei Railway Station (台北車站) on Zhongxiao West Road, Sec 1 - opposite the 53 story Shinkong Mitsukoshi Building (新光三越). Taipei Main Station is a huge facility. Ticket counters are on the first floor and platforms in B1. There is also a food court on the second floor, several underground shopping malls, an auditorium on the 5th floor and MRT stations serving three lines. In addition to ticket counters, the first floor also has a tourist office, small supermarkets, a post office, stores selling aboriginal handicrafts and several booths offering head and neck and full body massage (NT$100 for ten minutes).
</p><p>The THSR stations and platforms are wheelchair-friendly and all trains include a wheelchair-accessible carriage (wider doors, ample space, accessible toilet). Note that the official English guide for online reservations distinguishes between "senior or disabled tickets" and "handicap-friendly seats"; while it's possible to buy a ticket for the former online ("correct passenger ID" required), a ticket for the latter has to be reserved by calling the ticketing office on the phone.

<p>Taipei is served by many intercity (客運) routes. The majority of routes start/terminate at either Taipei, Taipei City Hall or Yuanshan bus stations, each served by MRT (Taipei Main Station for Taipei). There are also many stops scattered around the city, particularly near Taipei Main Station.

<p>Taipei City has a very clean, efficient and safe Mass Rapid Transit system <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.trtc.com.tw/e/">[8]</a> known most commonly as the <b>MRT</b>, but also called <b>Metro Taipei</b> (台北捷運). The brown line(Wenhu), which terminates at Taipei Zoo and Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center is a driverless elevated system. The last trains depart at midnight . Fares are between NT$20 and NT$65 for one-way trips around town. Stations and trains are clearly identified in English, so even for those who cannot read Chinese, the MRT system is very accessible. All stops are announced in four languages: Mandarin, English, Taiwanese Hokkien and Hakka. Most stations have information booth/ticket offices close to the ticket vending machines. <b>Eating or drinking is prohibited</b> past the fare gates. Trains generally run from 6:00 to midnight, with convenient bus connections found outside the stations.
</p><p>Women and/or children traveling at night can benefit from the <b>Safe Zones</b> - sections of platforms that are under heavy surveillance - located in some of the subway lines. Stations and trains (including the monorail) are wheelchair-friendly, but note that when there are multiple exits from a single station, usually only one of these is equipped with a lift.

<p>In addition to single journey tickets, rechargable IC cards can be used. There are four cards: EasyCard (悠遊卡), iPass (一卡通), icash and HappyCash. In terms of using the MRT or TRA, there is virtually no difference between the cards. Cards can be purchased and recharged at station ticket offices, vending machines or convenience stores. There is a 20% discount for MRT trips using all cards. There may be discounts on buses as well. These cards can also be used for various other payments.
</p><p>It is also possible to buy day cards just for the metro system for NT$200 (refundable deposit of NT$50)and for NT$180 you can buy a card that works on both the metro and buses. Alternatively, the Taipei Pass costs NT$250 (no deposit) and covers travel on the metro and Maokong Gondola for one day. These are very convenient and if you are doing more than 6 or 8 journeys in a day, will also cover their cost . For more information, see their website <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.easycard.com.tw/english/index.asp">[9]</a>. In recent times, major convenience stores such as 7-11, as well as various other retail outlets have begun to accept the card as payment. 
</p><p>Often times limited-edition cards are issued by the transit authority depicting artworks, famous characters, landscapes, etc. These are quite collectible and are perfect souvenirs for your trip. Remember single-journey tokens are recycled when you exit the stations, so if you want to keep a particular one you should purchase an extra.
</p><p>Train stations with connecting lines have multi level platforms. Some lines have split stacked platform with different colour lines heading in each directions.

<p>Taipei City has a very efficient bus service <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.e-bus.taipei.gov.tw/">[10]</a>, and because all buses display information (destination and the names of stops) in English, the system is very accessible to non-Chinese speaking visitors. <b>Payment</b> can be made by cash (NT$15) or IC cards (see "metro" listing) for each section that the bus passes through. For local buses (all local buses have a number, but long distance buses do not) the maximum will be two sections with a total cost of NT$30. The confusion, however, arises by not knowing where the section boundaries are located and the fact that there is often a buffer zone to prevent people who get on one stop before the boundary from overpayment.
</p><p>If you are using an IC card, remember to touch in and touch out to ensure the correct calculation of your bus fare. The failure to touch out will lead to the locking of your card. 
</p><p>Besides, if you are transferring from the transit system to a bus within one hour, there is a discounted bus fare (It's now NT$7 for the first transit section).

<p>Taxis are the most flexible way to get around in the city and are extremely numerous. They are expensive in comparison to mass transit, but are cheap when compared to taxis in the developed countries. Most taxi drivers cannot speak English, and it will be necessary for non-Chinese speakers to have their <b>destination written down in Chinese</b> though most taxis are equipped with GPS systems. Taxis are metered, starting at NT$70, with higher rates for night (an additional NT$20 over the meter). <b>Tipping</b> is neither necessary nor expected.
</p><p>Taking a taxi out of the city may save tourists a lot of time from waiting and multi transits. Take Jiufen for example, tourists may spend 2 hours standing on a bus to reach there, but it only takes 40 minutes by taxi. The regular price is NT$1000~1500. But if tourists reserve a ride one day before online, such as Tripool, the price can be as low as NT$700 per ride. The fare for mid-to-long range ride is up to 50% less than hailing a taxi on the street. And most of all, there will be no language barrier because all essential details are arranged in advance online.
</p><p>Taiwanese taxi drivers tend to be more honest and friendly than in many other countries.

<p>Even though motorized traffic is very heavy in Taipei, bicycles are still legitimate vehicles to get around. There are long cycle paths beside most rivers in the city. Bicycles can also be carried on the Taipei metro but only at certain times and via certain stations - bicycles aren't permitted in larger interchange stations such as Taipei Main Station and Zhongxiao Fuxing, and bicycles are only permitted in the first and last carriages. Unlike Mainland China, there are no segregated bike lanes but on the busiest streets cycling on the pavement (US English: sidewalk) is permitted, as in Japan.
</p><p>Taipei recently started its <b>YouBike bicycle rental</b> program where citizens and tourists can use EasyCard to check out a bike at most metro stations. Taiwan phone number registration, plus your EasyCard, is required, and registration is available in english. It has become extremely popular for tourists to get around the city. It costs NT$10-40 per half hour to rent.

<p>Renting a car is not only unnecessary, but not recommended in Taipei unless you are planning to head out of the city. Traffic tends to be frantic, and parking spaces are expensive and difficult to find. Most of the main tourist destinations are reachable by public transport, and you should use that as your main mode of travel.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Address_system">Address system</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Taipei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19" title="Edit section: Address system">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The Taipei address system is very logical and user-friendly. The hub of the city is the corner of the east-west running Zhongxiao (忠孝) and north-south running Zhongshan (中山) Rds, however while the north/south divide is made at Zhongxiao here, further east it is made instead at Bade (八德) Rd, something which confuses even people who have lived in Taipei for years. All major roads are identified by their direction in relation to these roads. For example, all sections of the north-south running Fuxing (復興) Rd north of Bade are called Fuxing North Rd (復興北路). Likewise, those sections to the south are called Fuxing South Rd (復興南路). Those that cross Zhongshan road are similarly identified as either east or west. Section (段; duàn) numbers begin at 'one' near the two defining roads and increase at intersections of major highways. For example, Ren'ai (仁愛) Rd (which has only an east location and therefore does not have a direction suffix), Section 1 will be close to Zhongshan South Rd. The section number will increase as one moves further away from Zhongshan Rd. So, for example, when Ren'ai Rd reaches Dunhua South Rd (敦化南路) far in the east of the city, a typical address could be: 7F, 166 Ren'ai Rd, Section 4. The house and lane numbers begin at zero every section. Lanes (巷; xiàng) lead off roads (路; lù) and streets (街; jiē), while alleys (弄; nòng) branch off lanes.

<p>Taipei is a city of people from many different origins, and you can find a good mix of Chinese (people whose families migrated to Taiwan from 1949 onwards) and native Taiwanese (people whose families had been in Taiwan since the Ming or Qing Dynasties). While <a href="/en/Chinese_phrasebook" title="Chinese phrasebook">Mandarin</a> is the <i>lingua franca</i>, and is spoken and understood by most people under the age of 60, other Chinese "dialects" are commonly heard as well. Among the native Taiwanese, while speakers of <a href="/en/Minnan_phrasebook" title="Minnan phrasebook">Minnan</a> form the majority, there is also a significant number of Hakka-speaking native Taiwanese living in Taipei.
</p><p><b>English</b> is compulsory in all Taiwanese schools, and most people under the age of 40 will have at least a basic grasp of English, though few are fluent. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that learning some Mandarin and/or Minnan will make your trip much smoother.

Taipei has often been skipped by tourists in favour of its East Asian rivals such as Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo, but those who take the time to visit Taipei and look around will soon find that Taipei is just as vibrant as any other major city, and is full of a certain charm which makes it unique in its own right. Just spend a day wandering around Taipei's streets and you will start finding many surprises.

<ul><li>The <b>National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall</b> (中正紀念堂) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cksmh.gov.tw/">[11]</a> is the famous symbol of both Taipei and the Republic of China. It is here that the nation's flag is raised every morning, and the huge court yard in front of the memorial serves as a place for both national celebrations as well as a platform to voice one's disapproval of the government. The memorial consists of a large bronze statue of Chiang Kai-shek, watched over by two motionless honor guards who are replaced every hour in a rifle twirling ceremony. Downstairs, there is a museum of Chiang's life, complete with his sedans and uniforms. Even if you are not into memorials, the gardens, with their Chinese style ponds, are definitely worth a visit. The memorial has its own MRT station on the Xindian line. The grounds of the memorial are also a favorite place for locals to gather and practice martial arts, though you'll have to be there early if you want to see this. Most people begin their work-out at around sunrise, and will have left for the office before 8AM.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Taipei 101</b> (臺北 101) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.taipei-101.com.tw/index_en.htm">[12]</a>. Officially known as the Taipei International Financial Center (臺北國際金融大樓), this 101-floor, 508-meter high skyscraper is in the Xinyi District of Taipei and is the ninth tallest skyscraper in the world. The tower is rich in symbolism; it was designed to resemble bamboo rising from the earth, a plant recognized in Asian cultures for its fast growth and flexibility, both of which are ideal characteristics for a financial building. The building is also divided into eight distinct sections, with eight being a number associated with prosperity in Chinese culture. The internal architecture of Taipei 101 is similarly awe-inspiring. Pay attention to ornate details on the structural beams, columns, and other elements. Taipei 101 is perhaps most notable for its feats of engineering. It was the world's tallest building from 2004 to 2010, as determined by three of the four standards designated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. It also boasts the world's second fastest elevators, which will zip visitors up to the 89th-floor observation deck in a mere 37 seconds (cost: NT$500. NT$450 for students/Youth Card Holders etc., NT$400 for kids under 12 – NT$1,000 fast track). It's worth taking a ride up, as the views are stunning. It opens 10am - 10pm daily. The best time to visit would be in the late afternoon when you spend a couple of hours and see both day and night views of Taipei (others recommend noon time for it appears less crowded as tour groups have lunch). You can also go up to the outdoor observatory on the 91st floor (note that while it's possible to go to the outdoor observatory in a wheelchair, the view is negligible, as the concrete railing is too high to see over). Don't forget to look toward the middle of the building, where you'll see the world's largest spherical tuned mass damper (one of three) that keep the building steady. Attached to the tower is a large, up-scale mall. While the stores are unremarkable in that they offer the same brand-names as stores in other major cities around the world, the open and spacious design of the structure itself definitely makes it worth a visit. A supermarket specializing in imported food items is located in the basement. (See also the "shopping" section for more on the mall). Taipei 101 is a 15 to 20-minute walk from the Taipei City Hall MRT station (Blue Line) but is best reachable by the World Trade Center stop (Red Line).</li></ul>
<ul><li>The <b>Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall</b> (國父紀念館) is constructed in the memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen who is the founding father of the Republic of China. The construction of the Memorial commenced in 1965 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. It was opened in May 16, 1972, with the majestic architecture and placid landscape covering an area of some 115,500 sq. meters. The park named <b>Zhongshan Park</b> marks the front yard of the Hall. On the inside, there is a 19-foot bronze statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, watched over the day by motionless military honor guards, along with a library of 400 seats storing over 1.4 millions books. The 100 meter long Zhongshan corridor links the main hall to the four large exhibition buildings where contemporary arts and historical articles are frequently on display. The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall has grown into much of a community center, and is much less touristy than the newer and larger Chiang Kai-shek Memorial. There is an auditorium which has weekly lectures and seminars on aspects of art and life. It is also a popular site for public concerts.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>National Theater Hall</b> (國家戲劇院) and <b>National Concert Hall</b> (國家音樂廳) - Located in the grounds of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial, it is an are excellent place to see performances of a Taiwanese play or a dance troupe. They also host many international events. Taiwan's National Symphony Orchestra <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://nso.ntch.edu.tw/">[13]</a> performs at the National Concert Hall. The building's neo-classic Chinese architecture is especially stunning when flood-lit at night.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>National Taiwan University</b> (台灣大學, or <i>台大</i>&lt;Tai-da&gt; for short) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ntu.edu.tw/">[14]</a>. Taiwan's pre-eminent institution of higher education, NTU is on the south side of Taipei. The campus grounds are surrounded by several blocks of shops, bookstores, eateries, cafes and tea houses popular with students and scholars. This is one of the main transportation hubs, as many buses stop here. While you wait for your bus, or before you go underground to catch the subway, you can shop for clothing, accessories, books, or trinkets. You name it, you can find it. Browse through the stalls and booths directly across the street from the main entrance of the university (don't forget there is a lot more just behind the main street), grab a bite or two of the popular snacks, such as fresh fruit, spice-cooked meats, soy goodies, sky high ice cream cones, sweets, shaved ice, tapioca teas, fresh bread, and more. You can also sample the yummy Taiwanese fried chicken chain <b>Ding Gua Gua</b>. Try a "Gua Gua Bao," a flavorful sticky rice pouch. If you like sweet potato, Ding Gua Gua's fries will make you want to come back for more! There are many American fast food restaurants across the street on the right of the University, right next to several wonderful book stores. Nearest MRT station: Gongguan (公館) on the Xindian (Green) Line.<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><a href="/en/File:DSC_1997.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/b5/DSC_1997.jpg/250px-DSC_1997.jpg" decoding="async" width="250" height="166" class="thumbimage" srcset="https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/b5/DSC_1997.jpg/375px-DSC_1997.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/b5/DSC_1997.jpg/500px-DSC_1997.jpg 2x" data-file-width="600" data-file-height="399" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/en/File:DSC_1997.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>The Grand Hotel</div></div></div></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>The Grand Hotel</b> (圓山大飯店) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.grand-hotel.org">[15]</a>. A 5-star hotel near Yuanshan, it was rated as one of the world's top ten hotels by the US Fortune magazine in 1968. It opened in May 1952, and expanded several times before becoming the landmark it is today. The swimming pool, tennis court, and membership lounge were constructed in 1953. The Golden Dragon Pavilion and Golden Dragon Restaurant opened in 1956 and the The Jade Phoenix Pavilion and Chi-Lin Pavilion opened in 1958 and 1963 respectively. The main Grand Hotel building was completed on the Double Tenth Day of 1973, making it an instant icon of Taipei. And this hotel is a part of scene in the Taiwanese film - <b>Eat Drink Man Woman</b> by the world famous Director - Ang Lee. It is arguably of 4-star quality, especially when compared to the hot hotel market that is Taipei. With that said, one can enjoy the atmosphere and snap some nice photos without actually sleeping here.</li></ul>

It just oozes with character, although don't come expecting to find teachings on meditation. The area around Longshan Temple, <b>Wanhua</b>, is one of the original districts of Taipei. And, while much of the traditional architecture has been lost, the area still maintains a traditional feel. It is here that the blind masseurs congregate to offer their skill. Likewise, this is the area where the Taiwanese come to learn who they should marry or what to name their children by consulting one of the many fortune tellers that set up shop along the roads and alleys around the temple. The temple is located at 211 Guangzhou Road (near junction with Guilin Road) and is open daily from 5AM to 10PM. The nearest MRT station is 'Longshan Temple' on the Ban-Nan Line.</li></ul>

<p>Even though very little ancient architecture remains in Taipei, four of Taipei's five original city gates still stand. The city walls which surrounded the old city and the West Gate were demolished by the Japanese to make way for roads and railway lines. Of the four gates still standing, the Kuomintang renovated three of them in its effort to restore Chinese architecture in Taipei, and converted them from the original southern Chinese architecture to northern Chinese palace style architecture, leaving only the <b>North Gate</b> (<b>beimen</b> 北門 or more formally <b>Cheng'en men</b> 承恩門) in its original Qing Dynasty splendour today. This gate sits forlornly in the traffic circle where the Zhonghua, Yanping and Boai roads meet.

It is often said that L.A. has no center. In contrast, one could say that Taipei is all center, and as such it has been given the epithet - "the emporium without end." Basically, however, the main shopping area can be divided into two districts: East and West. West Taipei is the old city and is characterized by narrow streets packed with small shops. The Western  district is also home to most government buildings and the Taipei Main Station. East Taipei boasts wide tree lined boulevards and the four main shopping malls are located in this area.

Only students who expect a very intensive experience, usually with a year or more of time to dedicate to study, should consider this program.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Unless you have a recommendation, the best way to find a good teacher is to visit a park at sunrise and check out the scene for yourself. If you spot a group that impresses you, approach one of the students and inquire about joining them. Most teachers will be happy to have a new student, though some old masters may 'play hard to get.' In the latter case, persistence is required. Most teachers will expect some sort of fee for their tuition. However, as it is considered impolite to directly ask the teacher this question, use a fellow student as mediator. Furthermore, when offering the money on the alloted day, place it in a red envelope (<i>hongbao</i> - available at all convenience and stationary stores) and slip it to the teacher subtly. Offering cash openly to a teacher of a traditional art or religion is considered undignified and demeaning. Most parks host tai'chi groups, but the most popular places are the grounds of the <b>Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall</b> (nearest MRT station - CKS Memorial Hall) and <b>Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall</b> (nearest MRT station - SYS Memorial Hall) as well as <b>228 Peace Park</b> (formerly known as New Park - nearest MRT station - National Taiwan University Hospital).</li></ul>

<p>Teaching English (or to a lesser extent, other foreign languages) is perhaps the easiest way to work in Taiwan. Work permits will be hard to come by and will take time. Consult your local Taiwan consulate/embassy/representative as far in advance as possible.
</p><p>Anyone staying in Taiwan for an extended period of time CAN find English teaching work, albeit technically illegally, so it can result in you being deported and barred from re-entry.

<p>Taipei probably has one of the highest densities of restaurants in the world. Almost every street and alley offers some kind of eatery. Of course, Chinese food (from all provinces) is well represented. In addition, Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, and Italian cuisines are also popular. Basically, East Taipei, especially around Dunhua and Anhe Roads, and also the ex-pat enclave of Tianmu is where to clash chopsticks with the rich and famous, whereas West Taipei offers smaller, homey restaurants.
</p><p>Due to the sheer number of restaurants, it is almost impossible to compile a thorough list, but below are a few recommended restaurants catering to specialist tastes.
</p>
<h3><span id="Night_markets_.28.E5.A4.9C.E5.B8.82.29"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Night_markets_(夜市)">Night markets (夜市)</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Taipei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=52" title="Edit section: Night markets (夜市)">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Several night markets (夜市) are located in each district. Some are open during the daytime, and all are open until around midnight. Night markets consist of restaurants and stores at permanent locations and little booths along the center. Every night market has a huge variety of food, so any night market you find is a good bet for good food. Because of the vast selection, the recommendation is to go with a few people and share the food. Vendor food is generally safe to eat, but use common sense if you have a sensitive stomach!

The most famous one in Taipei is the <b>Shilin Night Market</b> (士林夜市). It is easily accessible via the MRT (red line) at either the Jiantan (劍潭) or Shilin (士林) stations. It has a large game section and many food shops. Nearby are vendors, and haggling is appropriate here for non-food vendors, especially clothing. Also, they may raise prices for you if you don't look Taiwanese. This is known as the most "touristy" night market, and shop owners generally can speak English.
</p><p>Locals in Taipei view Shilin as touristy, with food catering to the tastes of mainland visitors. Another excellent option is <b>Ning Xia Yeshi</b>.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Gongguan Yeshi</b> is located on the western side of Roosevelt Road across the street from National Taiwan University (Taida). When exiting Gongguan station (green line), use exit #1 and follow the sidewalk until you see stands lining the side streets. This night market is closed on Wednesday nights. It is known for its variety of food, and for most shop owners know English due to the international student population at NTU.</li>
<li><b>Longshan Yeshi</b> is a classic part of Taipei located at Longshan Station on the MRT Blue line. It is home to "Snake Alley" and the famous Longshan Temple, which is one of the largest temples in Asia. Taiwan's "red light district" is located nearby, and a number of the city's homeless congregate here due to free food offerings from the temple. However, crime is extremely low so you should not be worried!</li>
<li><b>Shida Yeshi</b> is a clothing-focused night market. Some food is available but with limited options.</li>
<li><b>Ximen Yeshi</b> is not technically a true night market, but is a very lively shopping area come sundown. It is one of the most modern markets in Taiwan, and there is often an abundance of acrobats and other street performers. It is located at Ximen Station off the MRT green line.</li></ul>
<p><b>Lehua Yeshi</b> is located off the MRT yellow line. It is in very Taiwanese territory. Few shop owners speak English, and the food is notably local.
<b>Lianoning Yeshi</b> is a mainly food-focused night market. 
<b>Linjiang (Tonghua) Yeshi</b> is located near the intersection of Tonghua and Xinjiang Street. It has diverse food offerings that are pretty local.
<b>Miaokou Yeshi</b> is located in New Taipei City, specifically Jilong (Keelung). It is right next to the Keelung Harbor and is known for its extremely diverse food offerings, including flavored ice, fried dough, and fresh seafood.
<b>Raohe Yeshi</b> is one of the "most Taiwanese" night markets within a few KM of downtown. It is one long road and is known for its local foods and cheap socks.
<b>Tamsui (Danshui) Yeshi</b> is located at the farthest stop on the MRT, Tamsui Station at the northern end of the red line. It is known for its beautiful view along the river, its massive ice cream cones, and its fresh, affordable seafood.
</p><p>Some of the best-known night market snacks are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Aiyu Jelly</b> (愛玉冰; ài-yù-bīng)</li>
<li><b>Fried chicken fillet</b> (雞排; jīpái)</li>
<li><b>Oyster vermicelli</b> (蚵仔麵線; ô-á mī-sòaⁿ)</li>
<li><b>Soy braised foods</b> (滷味; lǔwèi)</li>
<li><b>Spareribs with herbs</b> (藥燉排骨; yàodùn páigǔ)</li>
<li><b>Stir fried cuttlefish</b> (生炒花枝; shēngchǎo huāzhī)</li></ul>

<p>Vegetarian food (素食) is also common fare, with the city boasting more than two hundred vegetarian restaurants and vendor stands. Another Taipei specialty is <b>vegetarian buffets</b>. They are common in every neighborhood, and unlike the 'all-you-can-eat' buffets listed below (which charge a set price, usually ranging from NT$250 - NT$350 including dessert and coffee/tea), the cost is estimated by the weight of the food on your plate. Rice (there is usually a choice of brown or white) is charged separately, but soup is free and you can refill as many times as you like. NT$75-120 will buy you a good-sized, nutritious meal. Note that many of these veggie restaurants are Buddhist in nature and so meals do not contain garlic or onion (which traditionalists claim inflames passion).

<p>While traditionally a nation of tea drinkers, in recent years the Taiwanese have really embraced the cafe culture, and all the usual chains can be found here in abundance. For cafes with more character, roam the back streets near National Taiwan University between Xinsheng South Road and Roosevelt Road. More cafes are located in the area around Renai Road, Section 4 and Dunhua South Road. There are also some interesting and characterful places between Yongkang Park and Chaozhou Street, and in the alleys around Shida Road.  However, for a particularly impressive range of styles, visit Bitan in <a href="/en/Xindian" title="Xindian">Xindian</a>, where all the cafes offer restful views over the river and mountains beyond (though can be noisy at weekend).

In fact, the owner of this cafe loves cats so much, stray ones are adopted, spayed/neutered, then allowed to live in the cafe. Thus, as you drink your beverage, don't be surprised if cats are checking you out. This cafe is indeed clean despite all the cats, and has tasty mid-range priced desserts and coffee, as well as salads/meals. The cats are friendly, if not always looking for a warm lap to sleep on. The younger cats might jump from lap to lap, just to find a playmate, even if the wiser, older cats do not care for such schenanigans.</span> </span></li></ul>

<p>Taiwan has a very free and liberal press. There are three daily local newspapers available in English, <b>the China Post</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/">[95]</a>, <b>the Taipei Times</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/">[96]</a>, and <b>the Taiwan News</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/">[97]</a>. Note that most media in Taiwan has a political slant; the China Post is more pan-blue while Taipei Times and Taiwan News are more pan-green.
</p><p>Free magazines and information are available from the following:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Centred on Taipei</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.community.com.tw/centered_on_taipei.php">[98]</a> is a free monthly designed for expats living in Taipei, but it is also very useful for visitors. It can be found in many of the major hotels throughout Taipei, and also in many businesses in the Tian Mu area.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>This Month in Taiwan</b> is a free magazine that lists events and has an exhaustive directory of useful numbers in Taiwan. It can be found at tourist offices and major hotels.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>POTS</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://en.pots.com.tw">[99]</a> is a free weekly where you can find out what is going on in the Taipei art, club, and bar scenes.

<p>Internet cafes are plentiful, especially in the maze of alleys between Taipei Main Station and Peace Park. However, you may have to wander around (and look up and down as many are on higher floors or in the basement) before finding one. Some computers are coin operated. Internet cafes are known as <i>wang-ka</i> in Chinese (a combination of <i>wang</i>, the Chinese word for 'net', and <i>ka</i> an abbreviation of 'cafe'.)
</p><p>Below is a list of a few recommended internet cafes:
</p>
<ul><li>B1 is on corner of Shida Road and Lane 117 – This internet cafe is a two minute walk from MRT station Taipower Building, exit 3.</li>
<li>Aztec, 2F. 235 Zhongxiao East Road, sec. 4.</li>
<li>LHH Cyber Cafe, 28 Guangfu South Road.</li>
<li>Skywalker Multimedia Entertainment Center, B1, 119 Minsheng East Road, sec. 2.</li></ul>
