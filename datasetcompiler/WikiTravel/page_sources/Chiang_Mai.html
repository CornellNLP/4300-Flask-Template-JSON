<p><b>Chiang Mai</b> (เชียงใหม่) is the hub of <a href="/en/North_(Thailand)" class="mw-redirect" title="North (Thailand)">Northern Thailand</a> and the Capital City of the Province Chiang Mai. Although Chiang Mai Municipality only has a population of 127,000 people, the accounted number only covers parts of the district Amphoe Mueang Chiang Mai in the inner city. When accounting for the entire urban area defined by the local government, Chiang Mai has a population of 1.2 Million people, making it Thailand's second-largest city after Bangkok. The Province of Chiang Mai has a total population of 1.8 Million people. Located on a plain at an elevation of 316&#160;m, surrounded by mountains and lush countryside, it is much greener and quieter than the capital Bangkok, and has a cosmopolitan feel and a significant expat population, factors which have led many from Bangkok to settle permanently in this "Rose of the North".

<p>Founded in 1296 CE, Chiang Mai is a culturally and historically interesting city, at one time the capital of the ancient Lanna kingdom. Located among the rolling foothills of the Himalayan Mountains 700 km north of Bangkok, it could only be reached by an arduous river journey or an elephant trek until the 1920s. This isolation helped keep Chiang Mai's distinctive charm intact. 
</p><p>Chiang Mai's historical centre is the <b>walled city</b> (<i>city</i> is <i>chiang</i> in the northern Thai dialect while <i>mai</i> is <i>new</i>, hence <i>Chiang Mai</i> or <i>New City</i>.) Sections of the wall dating to their restoration a few decades ago remain at the gates and corners, but of the rest only the moat remains.
</p><p>Inside Chiang Mai's remaining city walls are about 50 temples dating back to the founding of the principality, in a combination of Burmese, Sri Lankan and Lanna Thai styles, decorated with beautiful wood carvings, Naga staircases, leonine and angelic guardians, gilded umbrellas and pagodas laced with gold filigree. The most famous is Wat Phra Sing in the center of the old own. Also famous is Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, a temple 13 km away on Doi Suthep mountain.
</p><p>Modern-day Chiang Mai has expanded in all directions, forming the city area from Hang Dong in the South, to Mae Rim in the North, and Suthep in the West, to San Kamphaeng in the East. In the inner city expansion has occurred particularly to the east towards the <b>Ping River</b> (<i>Mae Nam Ping</i>), where Chang Klan Rd, the famous <b>Night Bazaar</b> and the bulk of Chiang Mai's hotels and guest houses are located. <b>Loi Kroh Rd</b> is the centre of the city's night life. The locals say you've not experienced Chiang Mai until you've seen the view from Doi Suthep, eaten a bowl of kao soi, and purchased an umbrella from Bo Sang. Of course this is touristic nonsense, but the Kao Soi, Bo Sang umbrellas, and Doi Suthep are important cultural icons for Chiang Mai residents. <b>Ratchadamnoen Rd</b> hosts the main Sunday night walking street market from Tha Phae Gate to the popular Wat Phra Singh.

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Chiang Mai's northern location and moderate elevation results in the city having a more temperate climate than that of much of Central, Eastern and Southern Thailand. Chiang Mai has a tropical wet and dry climate, tempered by the low latitude and moderate elevation, with warm to hot weather year-round, though nighttime conditions during the dry season can be cool and are much lower than daytime highs. The maximum temperature ever recorded is 42.4 °C (108.3 °F) in May 2005. As with the rest of Thailand there are three seasons.
</p>
<ul><li>A <b>cool/dry season</b> from mid Oct-mid Feb (it's really only cool at night, and a few days here and there in Dec/Jan)</li>
<li>A <b>hot season</b> from mid Feb-mid Jun (hot, hot, hot)</li>
<li>A <b>wet season</b> from mid Jun-mid Oct (hot and wet, though cooler than the hot season, clouds and the occasional downpour help cool things off)</li></ul>
<p>However, note that it can be hot in the cool season (during the day), wet in the cool/dry season (though days go by without rain, it is not unheard of), and dry (and hot) in the wet season. One nice thing about the wet season is that the prevalence of clouds can moderate the heat.
</p><p>From late February through April (and sometimes into May) is the region's <b>burning season</b>. This is throughout Northern Thailand, Northeastern Myanmar, and Northern Laos during this time. Traditional "Slash-and-burn" agriculture, waste from rice and maize harvests is burned this time of year, together with forest clearing and general trash disposal. This is a time of moderate to severe health impacts. The air pollution may be tracked at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://aqicn.org/city/chiang-mai/">aqicn.org</a>. The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/firemap/">Fire Mapper website</a> using satellite data can show the extent of the burning in the region (and globally).

<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://chiangmaiairportthai.com">Chiang Mai International Airport</a> (<b>CNX</b>) handles both domestic and regional international flights. The route from Bangkok is one of the busiest in the country.  Thai Airways flies daily almost every hour, with additional flights in the peak tourist season.  There are currently (August 2018) 31 different airlines that fly into and out of CNX, including:

<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.airasia.com">Air Asia</a> A well-known Asian low-cost airline, has domestic flights from/to Bangkok (Don Mueang airport), Phuket, Krabi, Hat Yai. Used to be the cheapest option if you booked at least a week before, but now it's true only during the best promotional offers (typically available months before the flight).  Regular fare for tickets to Bangkok, including taxes, is from 1,400 baht (with fees for luggage, food, seat reservation easily adding almost half of that).  Promotional fares can be much less.  Prices can be significantly higher if you book just a few days before, or want a specific day/flight</li></ul>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.bangkokair.com">Bangkok Airways</a> A full-service carrier positioning itself as an "Asia's boutique airline", flies to from/to Ko Samui, Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi), Krabi, Phuket and Udon Thani.  Surprisingly, Bangkok Airways can be cheaper than the budget airlines, particularly if you book just a few days ahead.  From 1,390 baht to Bangkok.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.nokair.com">Nok Air</a> Thai (semi-) low-cost carrier, flies from/to Bangkok's Don Mueang Airport more than 10 times a day (typically from 1,500 baht. Promo fares can be as low as 800-900 baht). They also fly from/to Udon Thani three times a day, the price is 1,000-2,000 baht (2014) and while it's still more expensive than a bus, it's much cheaper than the price of the Lao Airlines flight to Vientiane, which is easily accessible from Udon Thani. When buying a Nok Air ticket online, always check the extra baggage fee, which can be confusing when travelling first time with Nok, you get 15 Kilo for free, Unlike Air Asia, you pay for all checked baggage after selecting flight. Just simply uncheck the extra baggage and insurance fee to save a waste of money.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Thai Smile <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.thaismileair.com">[11]</a> A low cost subsidiary of Thai Airways flies to/from CNX from BKK.</li></ul>
<ul><li>There are many more airlines and code-sharing with airlines which connect through BKK or DMK to CNX. Book ahead, and use apps for up-to-date pricing. Depending upon time-of-day it can cost from 500-1,500 THB (or more for first class) for the Bangkok-Chiang Mai run. Nearly the same price, more comfortable, much faster, and usually safer than a bus or a train.</li></ul>
<p>Note that nearly all of these airlines have mobile apps that make it easy to check prices, buy, and check in ahead of time.

<p>The airport is some 3 km southwest of the city center, only 10-15 minutes away by car. Legal airport taxis charge a flat 160 baht for up to 5 passengers anywhere in the city, except the Arcade Bus Terminal, which costs 200 baht; if you take a metered taxi, the fee will start from 40 baht + a 50 baht service fee from the Meter Taxi counter. The taxis operate from the exit at the north end of the terminal, after baggage claim and/or customs, walk into the reception hall and turn left. 
</p><p>There are public buses, even though the information counter in the airport will tell you there are not (and of course all taxi/tuktuk drivers will support this 
</p><p>claim) and you have to take the 40 baht shuttle. If you want to wait for the infrequent bus, go outside of the airport terminal turn left and walk for 100 meters until you see the bus stop. We took bus number 9 (runs from 5:30 am) to town for only 20 baht. Have your hotel address at hand or even better a map (aka a screenshot) where the hotel is clearly marked and show it to the bus attendant. They will tell you if it's on their route. (September 2016) Alternatively, take bus #4 to the city center for 15 baht, or charter a tuk-tuk or songthaew for 50-60 baht per person. Most hotels and some upmarket guesthouses offer cheap or free pick-up/drop-off services. Note that the public bus system is generally not used by many people, and has few buses operating. It is also one of the ugliest buses around and has few markings for what it is. Frankly there are so many transportation options already operating that run at reasonable cost, that a local city bus, while it might seem reasonable and appropriate to people from the west, is really not a great option (no timetable, and unclear how long one has to wait most of the time). 
</p><p>As of 2021 the modern 20 Baht buses no longer operate in Chiang Mai and have been replaced by shuttle buses.
</p><p>160 baht is the current rate for a taxi to central Chiang Mai. If you are alone outside the airport grounds, you might get asked by a police officer asking if you are lost, just say you are getting a public bus to Chiang Mai. They will tell you its very far, when it is not. Just wait for a grey bus to pull over. Always go to a public bus stop outside the airport. Stop getting the chance of getting fined by police for Jaywalking. The other option is if you are alone travelling, just start talking to people in the plane and offer to share the taxi fare to Chiang Mai, as the price for the taxi is generally the same for a carload as for one person.
</p><p>If you arrive after midnight, catching a songthaew will be a problem.  There will not be any around.  If you are lucky, one may pull up after dropping off passengers.  It is better to get people from your same flight to share a taxi into town.
</p><p>Grab Taxi and Bolt are viable alternatives, especially the latter as it offers the cheapest prices. Uber has ceased to exist in South East Asia and has developed into Grab Taxi.

<p>Chiang Mai has two official bus stations, consisting of 3 terminals:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Arcade Bus Station</b> (Bus Terminals 2 and 3, Tel. +66 53 242664) — At the far end of Kaeo Narawat Rd just before it meets the superhighway. Buses from and to destinations <b>outside Chiang Mai Province</b> use this station. It effectively has two terminals, separated by a tuk-tuk stand and a road.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Terminal 3 is the larger of the two. It has an Internet cafe, small food vendors, ATMs, the ticket windows for Green Bus (cannot book online, but the schedules are) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.greenbusthailand.com/website/en/services/bus/bus-route">[23]</a>, which serves Chiang Mai province and the rest of Thailand with more comfortable but more expensive seats that the local buses (at Chang Puak Bus Station, see below), and numerous other ticket sellers. Buses for Bangkok, Phitsanulok, Ubon, Korat, Nan, Luang Prabang, Mae Sot depart from here.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Terminal 2 has a tourist police office, ATMs, food vendors, and many ticket sellers, including the booking office for government buses. Buses depart from here for Bangkok, Phitsanulok, Udon. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to what buses go to which destination from which terminal. There is a good deal of overlap.</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Chang Puak Bus Station</b> (Bus Terminal 1, Tel. +66 53 211586) — Off Chang Phuak Rd, on the north side of the moat, about 1 km north of Chang Puak Gate. This station handles local bus service <b>within Chiang Mai Province</b> including Mae Rim, Chiang Dao, Fang, Tha Ton, Phrao, Hot, Chom Thong, Doi Tao, and Samoeng.</li></ul>

<p>A variety of daily buses leave frequently from <a href="/en/Bangkok/Phahonyothin#By_bus" title="Bangkok/Phahonyothin">Bangkok's Northern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit)</a>, offering varying choices of price, comfort and speed.
</p>
<ul><li>Rattling government buses make frequent stops at every minor township. The journey takes around 12 hrs and costs 400 to 800 Baht (express is more expensive).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Non-stop 24/32-seaters and 1st class buses such as Nakhon Chai Air provide larger seats and snacks; making the long trip more comfortable. They manage the trip around 9 hours and cost ~950 baht. Be cautious about the so-called "VIP" buses touted on Khao San Rd. They may be cheaper, but you may end up crammed into a 2nd class bus or worse. Reliable VIP buses like Sombat tour, New Viriya, Bangkok Busline with reclining seats can be booked online in advance, as well as through third party travel agents.</li></ul>
<p>At Arcade Bus Station, upon arrival, public songthaews wait near Terminal 3, adjacent to the road that bisects the two terminals. Look for local people getting into them, and ask the driver if he goes to your destination (don't forget to confirm the price). A shared trip to Tha Phae Gate (south edge of the old town) should cost 20 baht per person, though you may have to wait for a driver who agrees, and also this level of service means the vehicle will stop along the route to pick up and disembark passengers, as would a local bus service. Virtually all songthaews will pass Warorot Market (city centre, just after crossing the river), from where it's just 1 km walk to Tha Phae Gate, or numerous (see "Get around" section) songthaews to other areas. 
</p><p>Alternatively, you can charter the whole songthaew or take a tuk-tuk. The drivers will approach you once you've arrived and will ask as much as 80-100 baht to the city centre/Tha Phae Gate, showing you a bogus price list with "fixed" prices. Bargain, it's just 5-6 km, so the fair price for tuk-tuk there is 80-100 baht, and is not more than 120 baht even to the opposite side of the city. It may be difficult to bargain with these drivers, however. A good idea is to ignore them from the start, walk out to the nearby street, and catch a passing tuk-tuk/songthaew there. If your luggage is light, you can walk to the centre, but it's quite a long walk, as the Arcade bus station is located in the city's northeast outskirts. There is a small shopping center a block to the east of Arcade Bus Station terminal #3, with coffee shops, restaurants and a decently stocked smaller Rimping market, if you depart from Arcade and still have some time to kill.
</p><p>Songthaew touts may ask foreign tourists for an outrageous 150 baht per person for a shared ride to town. Challenged, they may drop to 100 baht, but standard fare is 20-30 baht for shared (not privately reserved) transportation at a sedate pace. Similar prices are demanded by tuk-tuk drivers, though those are more expensive to operate. 80-100 THB from Arcade to the moat area is common and not unreasonable, and is faster unless during rush hour. The main point is to be clear on whether you are hiring for a point-to-point transportation, or simply as one or more passengers with stops along the route. The former is faster (sometimes) and better for a group, the latter is per passenger as a charge and may meander a bit. Some drivers will agree to a larger fee, but then stop along the way, anyways. Best to relax and take things as they come.

<p>Services from Bangkok's train station in Hua Lamphong<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bangkok#By_train">[24]</a> leave on a regular daily schedule <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.railway.co.th/English/Time_HTML.asp">[25]</a> and take 14-16 hours to reach Chiang Mai. If you go by night train (recommended), try to choose one which arrives late to get an opportunity to see the landscapes. They are really impressive, with bridges, forest, villages and fields.
</p><p><b>Daytime services</b> leave at 08:30, and 14:30 with second-class (281 baht) and third-class (121 baht) carriages. The seats in each class differ in softness and width and become uncomfortable after 10+ hours. 
</p><p><b>Overnight sleepers</b> provide comfortable bunks with clean sheets and pillows in first- and second-class. First-class beds (~1,400 baht) are in private two-bed compartments; in some trains first class compartments have only one berth and cost 500 baht more than usual, and whole compartments can be booked for single occupancy for the same amount. In second-class (~900 baht), the carriages are open but each bunk has a curtain for privacy. First-class is always air-con, second class is sometimes air-con. There are usually four trains per day with sleeper accommodation, though only two of these will have first-class compartments. Station staff will be able to help you.
</p><p>Newer types of carriages are kept clean; the toilet and floors are regularly mopped during the journey.  However the older type of second class carriages may have unpleasant toilet compartments (messy floors, bad odour even from the journey start).  Vendors make regular rounds selling snacks, drinks and lacklustre meals. Vendors will try to inflate the prices for tourists so be prepared to get ripped off, haggle, hop off quickly at stations or bring your own. Since 2015 State Railways of Thailand stopped selling alcoholic beverages on all trains, and bringing your own alcohol is not permitted on board.
</p><p>In second-class, the bunks are arranged lengthways along the train, with only a curtain separating the berths and the central aisle.  At some point in the evening, or on request, the attendant hinges down the top bunk to form the upper single berth and adjusts the seats to form the lower single berth.   In the morning, bunks are folded away leaving pairs of facing seats.   Be aware - on a recent train trip from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, the latch securing the heavy upper berth to the carriage wall unlocked itself, causing the berth to come crashing down above the heads of seated passengers.  It was only luck that no-one was struck by the falling frame, as the weight could have caused serious injury.
</p><p>In first-class, the bottom bunk is used as a bench seat before having a futon mattress deployed onto it in the evening.
</p><p>If you're not in the mood for bed when your carriage mates are bedding down, you can head off to the dining car, which provides fairly good food and drink at not too great a premium. Later in the night, the dining car can turn into a disco, complete with loud music and flashing lights. 
</p><p><b>Tickets</b> can be bought up to 60 days in advance at any station in Thailand. Booking in advance is advised, especially for the popular 2nd-class overnight sleepers. Larger stations accept payment with Visa/MasterCard. This is fairly safe, as SRT is a state-owned company. Since February 2015 trains from Bangkok to Chiang Mai can be booked online, even more than 60 days in advance.
</p><p>SRT has rules set for the advance booking based mostly on the percentage of the whole trip. Like, say, Chiang Mai - Bangkok tickets can be bought 60 days in advance, Chiang Mai - Phitsanulok or Sukhothai would be 30 days, while Ayutthaya is still 60 days (because it's over half of the trip). This has to be taken into consideration when planning trips from Chiang Mai - as trains are usually full, especially during high season (Oct-Feb, Apr).
</p><p>1st and 2nd class air-con sleeper tickets are 150-200 baht more expensive than fan-only car tickets. Various travel agencies, some available to contact from outside Thailand, can also procure tickets for delivery or pick up, with fees typically starting at 200 baht. If at the train station they said that at train is sold out, try the small agencies, they may still find you a ticket (although unlikely because ticket is usually issued for a name and passport number). Be aware of 'scalping' and do not pay ridiculously high prices.
</p><p>seating only Air conditioned service available as on October 2017  at 641 THB
includes refreshments and hot meals served by a pleasant onboard hostess.
depart Chiang Mai 8.50 AM offering fantastic views all along the way in day light.
clean toilets too.
</p><p>SRT charges 90 baht to transport a bicycle between <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> and Chiang Mai.
</p><p><b>Chiang Mai train station</b> is about 3 km east of the city centre. Plentiful songthaews and tuk-tuks await each train's arrival. If you want to walk, exit the station, cross the open square in front and turn left on the first major road you come to (Charoen Muang Rd); this road goes directly to city centre.
</p><p>Last time advice: the air conditioning can be very powerful. Don't forget to bring a jacket with you or you are going to spend a bad night.

<p>Thailand's road fatality rate is the second highest in the world - if you wouldn't ride in a vehicle without a seat belt in your home country - you should do the same in Thailand.  That means using a taxi - somewhat more inconvenient, more expensive but definitely safer.  In groups of 2 or more, taxis are competitive and with luggage a necessity (see the taxi section below). Songthaew (red trucks) are becoming more difficult to flag especially during rush hour and TukTuk's, while loved by tourists, are uncomfortable, noisy, polluting and unsafe.

<p>There are newly introduced local buses in Chiang Mai. The most useful bus for visitors are B1 and B2. Both white coloured buses stationed at the main road in between Bus Station Chiang Mai and Arcade Bus Station. Bus B1 route is Bus Station - Chiang Mai Railway Station - Thaphae Gate - Zoo and vice versa. Bus B2 route is Bus Station - Thaphae Gate - Chiang Mai Airport and vice versa. Both pass by Wororot Market. The minimum fare is 15 baht. The normal fare is 30 Baht
The bus lines 1 and 3 have party a different route. So check in the bus map from which bus station you need to go back.

<p>In lieu of a local bus service, locals get around the city on <i>songthaew</i> (สองแถว). These covered pick-up trucks have two long bench seats in the back (<i>songthaew</i> means "two rows" in Thai), and travel fixed routes picking up passengers en route who are going the same way. Some can also be hired outright.
</p><p>The colour of the songthaew indicates its general route or usage. Most common, by far, are <b>red</b> songthaews (called <i>rod daeng</i>, <i>red</i> truck, รถแดง), which don't follow a specific route and roam the main streets around markets, temples, or the bus/train stations. Prices must be negotiated. but expect 30 baht per person anywhere within the city walls and 40-60 baht outside. Drivers often ask tourists for more than this. Just stop a red Songthaew and tell/show where you like to go. The driver will tell you if he goes in that direction. If yes it's about negotiating the price. 
</p><p><br />
<b>Fixed route songthaews</b> congregate around Warorot Market. From Warorot Market, <b>white</b> songthaews travel to the eastern suburban city of Sankampaeng, <b>yellow</b> songthaews travel to Mae Rim in the north, <b>blue</b> songthaews travel to Sarapee and Lamphun in the south, and <b>green</b> songthaews travel to Mae Jo in the northeast. The rate is fixed.
</p><p>From Pratu Chiang Mai Market, songthaews also travel to Hang Dong (20 baht) and San Patong, southwest of Chiang Mai.
</p><p><b>From Songthaew to Taxi</b>
Any of the Red songthaew (rod daeng) can give you taxi service if you ask for it.  Then you sit up front, with AC if it's on, and go direct to your destination.  This is going to cost you more than 30 baht but you can often negotiate a fare that's less than a taxi (usually 150 baht one way in the city). If you stay is short, at a dentist for example, the driver will wait and bring you back.  Also, taxis don't cruse the streets so they can be hard to find, songthaew are always around. Also, during morning and evening rush hour Songthaew will not take passengers to certain areas like the Khad Suan Kiew shopping mall because of traffic jams in the area - try offering a higher fare to compensate the driver for his time .
</p><p><b>To catch a red songthaew</b>; approach a waiting driver or flag one down on the street, state your destination and if the driver is going that direction he will nod in agreement and give you a price. Negotiate a lower fare if you wish. The price agreed to should be <i>per person</i>; it's a good idea to confirm this with the driver before you leave. On reaching your destination, ring the buzzer on the roof to tell the driver to stop, or most likely the driver will pull over, wait for you to get out and pay.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_tuk-tuk_or_samlor">By tuk-tuk or samlor</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Chiang_Mai&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16" title="Edit section: By tuk-tuk or samlor">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p><b>Tuk-tuks</b> are a quick, though noisy way to get around. Fares are usually 40-50 baht for a short hop and 50-100 baht for longer distances, depending on the proficiency of your bargaining. As a guide, <b>expect to pay</b> 50-100 baht from the old city to the riverside and Night Bazaar, the railway station, and 100-150 baht to the bus station or airport. Tuk-tuks parked near the bus and train stations will ask you for something like 120-150 baht. Just haggle or walk away to the nearest road and stop a passing tuk-tuk or songthaew there.
</p><p>According to expats, the highest fee for a tuk-tuk at any time of day or night should be 150 baht for any location if it's inside the first highway ring around the city, traveling from or to the the city center between the 2nd and 3rd highway ring generally cost a flat fee of 300 baht. If you are trying to go from the Zoo to the Arcade Bus Station, good luck with that. The point is, Tuk Tuks tend to charge more. Find a Rot Daeng (red truck) or other color if you are not in a hurry and want to pay less (and perhaps go farther).
</p><p>The fee seems to be based on multiples of 20 baht which is the smallest note. It is a good idea to stock up on notes and coins as whenever you offer a note higher than the agreed fee the driver may have no change! True indeed.
</p><p>Some Tuk Tuks will have signs indicating they can be hired at an hourly or daily rate. This is far more economical and the drivers are happy to hang out in their tuk tuk waiting for the riders to visit wherever they want to go. 
</p><p>A few <b>samlor</b> (three-wheeled bicycles) still cruise the streets and will happily take you to a temple for the same price as a tuk-tuk, though at a considerably quieter and slower pace. Mostly these are used by local elderly for trips to the market. Quite charming.
</p><p>Note that in many cases a Taxi is the same price (or less) than a Tuk Tuk and that the Grab app has an option to request an electric tuk-tuk with plans to make all of the fleet electric.

<p>There are several taxi companies in Chiangmai - you need a phone to use them - bring a GSM phone with you and use the SIM card the mobile companies give you at the airport.  Taxis do not cruise the streets - you find them at the airport, railway station, bus station and hotels. If you have luggage, you will probably take a taxi when you arrive - ask the driver for his phone number - then get one or two more taxi numbers in case he is busy.  
</p><p>One service advertises a fare of 150 baht to destinations around the old city - higher fares outside of the city.  If you have 4 people in your party this is a good rate.  Late at night transportation is hard to find, so carry those taxi numbers with you. Tuk Tuks are around at night but I don't consider them safe (no seat belts, no doors) or comfortable (noisy, windy) be safe, call a taxi.
</p><p>Grab Taxi (like Uber) is a mobile app that one can use to get around Chiang Mai. You can enter the pick up and drop off destinations and it will give you either a fare estimate or fixed rate depending on the type of taxi service you request. Most rides within the city will cost 40-80 baht. A ride from the airport will range from 150-190 baht.

<p>A motorbike (what North Americans call a scooter) is a convenient and cheap way to get around town or reach the outlying sights. If you have never ridden a motorbike before Chiangmai is not the place to learn.  If you must rent find a quiet street and practice BEFORE you get into traffic.  More than 1000 foreigners were injured in 2018 mostly in motorcycle accidents. There are an abundance of nearly indistinguishable rental outfits in town, and most guest houses can arrange rentals. Automatic 110cc and 125cc motorbike capable of carrying two people are the easiest to operate (for those with limited motorbike experience), but step-through Honda Waves are also very popular, and off-road bikes and larger street bikes are also an option. A valid Thai or international drivers licence is legally required to rent, though most places will not require it. UPDATE&#160;: police are stopping foreigners on motorcycles and checking documents. 
</p><p>Motorbikes are 100-150 baht/day for a 110cc motorbike and 150-200 baht/day for a Honda Wave 125cc, which is faster if you plan to drive uphill to e.g. Wat Doi Suthep. They come supplied with helmets and a security chain. If you rent longer term, e.g., by the month, those rates can be as low as 2,400 to 2,700 baht per month, averaging 80-90 baht per day. Several dealers will agree to these rates.
</p><p>Larger machines cost 700 baht/day for a V-twin chopper or larger sport-bike. Expect discounts when renting for a week, month, or longer.
</p><p>Rentals will require a deposit (generally prudent opinion would say that while many ask for a passport you should under no circumstances leave your passport with anyone  as collateral).  Let them make a copy of your passport and return it. However, this will require a larger deposit (5,000 THB or so). Remember that if you want to leave the country you will need your passport; and that you must ALWAYS carry a photocopy of the passport and visa/entry stamp pages.  An additional photo ID isn't a bad idea. Most shops will accept a passport photocopy with a cash deposit of around 3,000-5,000 baht. This is a much better alternative to surrendering your passport. While the petrol/gas tank may be full on pick-up, it is not uncommon for shops to deliver a bike with just enough fuel to go make it to a service station. In any case, return the bike with as much or more fuel than received to avoid any penalties. Also check out the relative mechanical merit of the bike being offered. Focus especially on the brakes, the degree of "pull" needed for the handlebar lever, and the travel needed for the foot brake. Check that indicators and  headlights work properly, and the tires are reasonably OK (top up tire pressure air at the nearest service station)
</p><p>Some rental agreements claim to <b>insure</b> you but generally only cover the bike for theft or damage. Don't expect much in the way of compensation if something bad such as an accident occurs. Regardless of who is at fault, assume that you will be considered the guilty party.
</p><p>The police frequently fine riders (including passengers) 500 baht for not wearing a helmet, plus you usually have to go to the police station the next day to pay the fine and to collect your licence. Some officers will allow you to pay 100 or 200 baht on the spot "to avoid paperwork and travelling to the station, etc.".
</p><p>A note about helmets. If you care about your face at all, the <b>half-helmets</b> that are most popular will not provide any safety. I personally know someone whose half helmet caused him to become deaf in one ear as the bottom edge crushed the nerves in his ear from an accident that blindsided him. If he had a full-face helmet he would still have hearing in that ear, and if he was wearing no helmet, he would be dead. Wear a full-face helmet! There are helmet shops everywhere in Chiang Mai, and getting a full-face helmet that fits properly is an investment that is well worth it (less than 1,000 THB), if you are going to be doing any amount of riding.

<p>Traffic inside the old city walls can be somewhat subdued, the roads are flat, and the distances are short (2km on each side of the moat) to make bicycling a quick way to get around. Bicycle rentals are plentiful; rental costs 50 -250 baht/day depending on the bike quality.  Few companies provide bicycle helmets - if you plan to ride a bicycle, be safe and bring your own helmet.  There are many potholes in Chiangmai streets so stay alert for obstacles, not to mention dogs that might chase you down small alleys. Keep to the left (not intuitive for North American/European cyclists). Also, realize you do not have the right of way, so asserting that could end in tears.

<p>Car hire services are available both in the city centre and at the airport. Cars typically offered include the Toyota Vios, Altis, and Yaris, and the Honda City and Jazz. Typical rates for newer models are 900-2,000 baht per day, depending on season and model. Expect a slight discount when renting weekly. Utility pickups such as the Toyota Hilux or Fortuner SUV are also available. Many places offer minivans such as 10-seat Toyota Commuters with a driver from about 2,000 baht per day plus fuel. Older Suzuki Carribean 4WDs are a cheaper option at around 600-800 baht per day, but they are relatively difficult to drive and less mechanically reliable than a standard passenger car.

<p>The old city is only a mile square, (say, 2.5 sq km) and as such is easy to walk around but be careful when crossing streets - drivers will not stop for you. The airport is also quite close to the old part of town--about 2.5 km--so if you have the energy and an hour to spare, you can even walk to and from the airport. Note that this is not necessarily a pleasant experience as the sidewalks are uneven (or non-existent) and Chiang Mai gets hot during the day, especially during the hot season, and rainy during the rainy season. The cost of a taxi or songthaew from the moat area to the airport is around 150 baht.

<p>This is is a great option for travelling to places outside Chiang Mai city, and the price is often similar to hiring a car and driving yourself. You'll also be able to relax and enjoy the scenery in air-conditioned comfort. The cost for a private car with driver is generally from 1,500 to 2,000 baht per day plus fuel depending on the type of vehicle and where you are going. The driver will typically pick you up with a full tank of fuel and you pay at the end. Large Toyota Hi-Ace, Nissan Urvan and newer Toyota Commuter minivans go for around 2,000 to 2,500 baht per day plus fuel. Most hotels and some guest houses can arrange it for you, in addition to vehicle rental outlets and the many travel agencies in town.

<p>There are many tours that will take you to places outside of the city.  Travel companies, hotels and guest houses can arrange tours.  Be sure to ask if the tour you are booking uses a truck or a van.  Avoid trucks as they are uncomfortable (you will sit in the back on a bench seat without air conditioning) and unsafe (no seat belt).  If your agent can't tell you, try another company.  The car or van option mentioned above is better and just as cheap if you have a group.

<p>The quintessential image of Chiang Mai with its large gold-plated <i>chedi</i>, visible from the city on a clear day, <b>Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep</b> (วัดพระธาตุดอยสุเทพ, Huai Kaeo Rd, 30 baht, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.doisuthep.com/index.php?lang=en">[26]</a>) is 18&#160;km from town, sitting at a 1,073&#160;m elevation on the slopes of Doi (Mount) Suthep. Built in 1383 during the Lanna Thai period, legend has it that the temples site was selected by an elephant sent to roam the mountain side, where upon reaching a suitable spot, it trumpeted, circled three times, knelt down and promptly died, which was interpreted as a sign indicating an auspicious site. The temple offers grand views over the city, but no reward is without effort as you must ascend the 300-plus steps of the Naga-lined stairs. The climb may be a strain in the high altitude's thin air for the less fit, so you may opt to take the cable car for 20 baht.  For the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://chiangmaibest.com/thai-holidays-festivals/visaka-bucha/">Visaka Bucha holiday</a> in June or July each year, it is traditional for people to walk from the zoo to the temple and vast numbers make the pilgrimage to the top, which takes around 4-5 hours.

<p>In the vicinity there are several other attractions you may want to consider visiting. The Bhuping Royal Palace Gardens are 4 km further along the road from Wat Prathat, with a reasonably easy walk along the meter-wide road shoulder. Or you can get a shared songthaew from Wat Prathat for 30 baht, but you may have to wait until it fills up. Further along the road is a hill tribe village, and although tourist-oriented, is really worth the trip. There are many shops for local handicrafts, etc. These are the people from the far north of the country, many originally from Myanmar. There are two areas in the village that require entrance fee: 10 baht to enter a flower garden (where women can take pictures using traditional clothes) and a hill tribe opium museum (the museum is in a very poor condition); and 10 baht to enter the hill tribe waterfall (man-made).

<p><b>Getting there</b>. Songthaews leave from various points in town, including the main bus terminal on Chang Puak Road, near the Northern city gate, Chiang Mai University, and Chiang Mai Zoo. You can either pay for a shared songthaew (40-70 baht, depending on the point of departure) and wait for the songthaew to fill up with 8-10 passengers, or hire your own songthaew for 600 baht. It is also possible to share the 600 baht with a few people, if there are four you pay 150 baht each. The process for coming back down is similar, though it is much easier to gather 10 people in short amount of time and share the fare. 
</p><p>There are several little annoying charges to pay for foreigners. To enter the Doi Suthep itself is free for Thais, and 30 baht for foreigners. Tour operators will ask 700 baht for a tour.  You can walk up the stairs to the temple but many visitors are encouraged to take the cable car (10 bath each way).  The cable car ride is short about 5 mins and inside a metal sheet tunnel - therefore no view at all.
</p><p>The journey from town can be made by motorcycle or a bicycle with appropriate gearing. The final 12 km from the zoo onwards is entirely uphill and will take 60-90 minutes if cycling.  Road condition is good but the winding  and steep road require some driving and riding experiences.

<p>There are more than 300 temples in Chiang Mai and its outskirts, with a dozen stand-outs of historical or architectural significance within walking distance of each other. Buddhist temples in Chiang Mai exhibit a mixture of Lanna Thai, Burmese, Sri Lankan and Mon architectural styles that reflect the varied heritage of Northern Thailand.
</p><p>Though certain temples on the conventional tourist circuit can be overrun with loud groups it is not hard to find many less well-known, but no less interesting, temples quietly and gently crumbling in the absence of tourist hordes. Whichever you visit, keep in mind that the temples are sacred religious places of deep cultural significance for the locals. Show respect by wearing appropriate attire (long pants for men, modest tops and skirts for women, no bare shoulders or plunging necklines and women must wear a bra). You must take off your shoes before entering the temple or other buildings, but they may be worn in the courtyard. <b>Taking photographs</b> of Buddha images is no problem, but it is polite to ask before taking pictures of monks or locals. All temples are free.

Of most historical interest is the <b>Wihan Lai Kham</b> in the back, featuring Lanna-style temple murals and intricate gold patterns on red lacquer behind the altar. The large chedi was built in 1345 by King Pha Yu to house the remains of his father King Kam Fu. A typical scripture repository is located at this temple as well. These repositories were designed to keep and protect the delicate sa or mulberry paper sheets used by monks and scribes to keep records and write down folklore. The high stucco-covered stone base of the repository protected the delicate scriptures from the rain, floods and pests. The walls of the chapel are covered with murals illustrating Lanna customs, dress, and scenes from daily life. The lovely Lai Kam chapel houses the revered Phra Singh Buddha image. Sadly, the head was stolen in 1922, and a reproduction is now seen. To enter the temple is free for Thais, and 20 baht for foreigners. The ticket is in a leaflet form containing useful information and map of Wat Phra Singh complex.</span> </span></li></ul>

Presumed to date from the year Chiang Mai was founded (1296), it is famed for two Buddha images, which according to legend are 1,800 and 2,500 years old. King Mengrai allegedly lived here while the city of Chiang Mai was being constructed. Enshrined in Wat Chiang Man is a tiny crystal Buddha called Pra Seh-Taang Kamaneeee, which is thought to have the power to bring rain. Another image, called Phra Sila Khoa, reflects the fine workmanship of Indian craftsmen from thousands of years ago.</span> </span></li></ul>

The temple was originally constructed in 1401 on the orders of King Saeng Muang Ma. In 1454, reigning King Tilo-Garaj enlarged the chedi (pronounced <i>jedee</i>) to a height of 86 m. After the earthquake, the chedi lay in ruins until 1991-92, when it was reconstructed at a cost of several million baht. A magnificent testament to Lanna (northern Thai) architecture and art, restored sections hint at its former glory. Wat Chedi Luang is also home to the "Pillar of the City", a totem used in ancient Thai fertility rites. </span> </span></li></ul>

Established in 1455 to host the eighth World Buddhist Council, many features of the grounds imitate significant places of the Buddha's enlightenment. Originally called <i>Botharam Maha Vihata</i> in honour of the venerated Bodhi tree, it came to be known as Wat Jet Yod by locals, after the seven spires (<i>Jet Yod</i>) protruding from the roof of the Vihara. The square-sided design of the Virhra is a replica of Mahabodhi temple in <a href="/en/Bodhgaya" class="mw-redirect" title="Bodhgaya">Bodhgaya</a>, India, though the translation has distorted proportions somewhat. Remnants of the graceful stucco relief murals that adorned the walls depict angels with a distinctly Indian flavour. The grounds also hold some more recently built, but abandoned looking, eroded chedis and buckling bases of vanished halls, overshadowed by a fully intact, though more diminutive, replica of '<i>Chedi Luang</i> that was built around 1487 to house the ashes of King Tilokarat.</span> </span></li></ul>

A fairly simple, rather scenic motorbike ride along Route 1001, this trip should take around 45 - 60 minutes at a comfortable, leisurely pace. Known as the "Sticky Waterfalls" due to the limestone deposits that are prevalent throughout. These mineral deposits provide a grippy surface for hands and feet, allowing one to travel UP a waterfall with relative ease. Very likely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and an absolute must see. Key notes: More powerful in the rainy season (June through September). A popular destination for Thai families on the weekends, so the area will be busier during this time. Some travelers have had a problem seeing the sign leading off of the main road down to the waterfalls; along the way there is a sign stating "Bua Tong 18km".

<p>It is extremely important to research your elephant tour. Please note that "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/love-elephants-heres-why-you-should-always-avoid-these-tourist-attractions/">An elephant’s back is not made for weight bearing; an elephant’s weight is carried on his thick pillar-like legs and his stout neck, not his back, which is relatively weak."</a>
</p><p>Aside from spinal injuries and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/circuses_entertainment/facts/elephant_rides_060109.html">other dangers of elephant riding</a>, elephants have had to undergo Phajaan to make them fit for riding; an extremely painful process in which the elephant is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_crushing">beaten and deprived of sleep, food and water for up to several weeks.</a> National Geographic reports on the use of nails and sticks stabbed into the ears and feet of an elephant undergoing Phajaan.
</p><p>While a source of great amusement, be sure to choose your tour responsibly. Some have reported elephants in distress and what looked like painful, horrible conditions for the animals. Ask other tourists and check online before choosing. When in doubt, choose a no-ride sanctuary rather than a riding park. It is important to understand that elephants are considered livestock under Thai law, and as such owners can treat them in any way they please. This often includes beating, stabbing, or blinding them, or subjecting them to Phajaan. Elephants generally will not accept riders on the trekking seat unless they have undergone the Phajaan. It is encouraged that visitors do their own research to draw their own conclusions. A good, although not foolproof, sign for spotting elephant mistreatment is holes in or pieces missing from the ear. When in doubt, choose a non-riding sanctuary.
</p><p>Every year there are reports of tourists who ride or come close to so-called 'domesticated' elements, maimed or killed by them, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/elephants-tourism-thailand/483138/">many more of their mahouts</a> (handlers) who are mainly Myanmar immigrants in poverty, are regularly killed.

<p>There are around 12 different hilltribe groups in Thailand, most of which live in northern Thailand and play an important part in the cultural tapestry. Visiting hilltribe villages as part of a trek or tour, is a popular activity in Chiang Mai although most within 1-2days travel of Chiang Mai are likely to be touristic. So if you're seeking an authentic experience, it's important to research properly the right tour for you, and the right way to visit. Many villagers are not so welcoming towards visitors nowadays, as they have had negative experiences with tourists in the past.

<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Bo_Sang_Umbrella__Sankampang_Handicrafts_Festival"><span class="fn org">Bo Sang Umbrella &amp; Sankampang Handicrafts Festival</span>. <span class="description">Takes place 15-17 January 2016 at Ban Bo Sang, Sankampang. The festival is in the form of a "street fair" in which the central road of the village is used, with shops on both sides. Shops are decorated in Lanna-style, most with the well-known umbrellas, as well as with traditional lanterns. In addition there are contests, exhibitions, cultural performances, local entertainment and assorted shows day and night. There is a grand procession decorated with umbrellas and local products, a variety of handicrafts for sale, northern-style khantoke meals, and the Miss Bo Sang pageant.</span> </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Chiang_Mai_Flower_Festival"><span class="fn org">Chiang Mai Flower Festival</span>, <a class="url external autonumber" href="http://chiangmaibest.com/chiang-mai-flower-festival/" rel="nofollow">[x]</a>. <span class="description">Staged every year during the first weekend in February (7-9 February in 2014). The city is awash with vibrant colous ranging from the electric orange and lilac colours of the bougainvillea to the velvety blossoms of petunias in all shades of pink, white and purple. The strident red of the poinsettias, bought by many at Christmas and New Year, is echoed by beds of scarlet salvias. Homes and shop owners alike line the city streets with colourful flower boxes. The sheer profusion of colour that the flower festival and carnival brings to Chiang Mai aptly gives the city its name "Rose of the North". On all three days of the festival, prize blooms are on display at Suan Buak Haad at the Southwest corner inside the moat of the old city. Many types of flower, miniature trees, and orchids are put on display for the judges to choose the best of the species. Landscape specialists put on an elaborate display, which includes patios and waterfalls with exotic decorative plants and flowers. The best part of the flower festival is on Saturday. The parade lines up from the train station to Narawat Bridge so the police close most of Jarenmuang Rd around 08:00. The VIP viewing stand is right next to the bridge in front of the Chiang Mai Governor's home. The parade route goes down Tha Phae Rd to the gate and turns left and follows the moat to Suan Buak Haad City Park. The parade moves at a slow pace and stops several times so there is plenty of time to take pictures of the colourful floats, pretty girls and hill tribe people in native costume. The paraders hand out roses to spectators lining the road. When the parade finishes everyone heads to Suan Buak Haad where all the floats, award winning flower growers and landscape projects are all on display. There are plenty of food stalls in the park, and in the late afternoon the Miss Chiang Mai Flower Festival starts. The party goes well into the evening until the new Flower Festival Queen has been chosen. This is a great time to visit Chiang Mai, as the air is cool and the evenings fresh and clear. If you want to see the festival make sure you book your hotels and flights well in advance.</span> </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Inthakin or Tham Boon Khan Dok</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://chiangmaibest.com/inthakin-city-pillar-festival/">[27]</a> is the City Pillar Festival in Chiang Mai. This is a six-day festival where the city pillar spirits are propitiated to ensure the continuity of the city. Occurs in May or June as part of the Northern Thailand lunar calendar. Very large event focused around Wat Chedi Luang.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Loi Krathong and Yi Peng Festivals</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://chiangmaibest.com/loy-krathong-yee-peng/">[28]</a> If you like candles placed in colourful paper lanterns, fireworks, beautiful girls in traditional dress, parade floats, lots of food, and parties, don't miss the Loi Krathong festival, which in Chiang Mai lasts for 3 full days, the last night being that of the 12th full moon of the year (which is usually in November). In the small town of Mae Jo, north of Chiang Mai, they start the festival on Saturday night by simultaneously launching thousands upon thousands of hot air balloons called <i>Khom Loy</i>.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Loi Krathong coincides with the northern Thai (Lanna) festival known as "Yi Peng" (Thai: ยี่เป็ง). Due to a difference between the old Lanna calendar and the Thai calendar, Yi Peng is held on a full moon of the 2nd month of the Lanna calendar ("Yi" meaning "2nd" and "Peng" meaning "month" in the Lanna language). A multitude of Lanna-style sky lanterns (khom loi (Thai: โคมลอย), literally: "floating lanterns") are launched into the air where they drift with the winds. The festival is meant as a time for tham bun (Thai: ทำบุญ), to make merit. People decorate their houses, gardens, and temples with khom fai (Thai: โคมไฟ): intricately shaped paper lanterns which take on different forms. Khom thue (Thai: โคมถือ) are lanterns which are carried around hanging from a stick, khom khwaen (Thai: โคมแขวน) are the hanging lanterns, and khom pariwat (Thai: โคมปริวรรต) which are placed at temples and which revolve due to the heat of the candle inside. Chiang Mai has the most elaborate Yi Peng celebrations, where both Loi Krathong and Yi Peng are celebrated at the same time resulting in lights floating on the waters, lights hanging from trees/buildings or standing on walls, and lights floating by in the sky.</dd></dl>

<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Songkran_Festival"><span class="fn org">Songkran Festival</span>, <a class="url external autonumber" href="http://chiangmaibest.com/songkran/" rel="nofollow">[x]</a>. <span class="description">The Thai Water Festival is celebrated as the Thai new year from April 13-15 (though it may begin a day or two early). The most obvious sign that you're in the middle of the festival is when you get soaked by someone pouring a bucket of water over you, or squirting you with a water gun! This tradition evolved from people tossing water that had been poured over holy statues, since this water was expected to be good luck. Now, it takes the form of a free-for-all water fight, and you will undoubtedly be drenched. It's also a way of staying cool during the very hot and humid month of April. Just be sure to put your cell phone in a plastic bag!</span> </span></li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Motorcycle touring</b> is a great way to explore Northern Thailand. One good half-day trip out of Chiang Mai is up and over Doi Suthep, which will take you up to Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, and beyond to Doi Pui. From there some trails can lead down to the back of Huay Tung Tao, a reservoir for relaxing besides and eating fish. Careful, some of these roads are dirt, experienced motorcyclists only. More extensive touring includes the Samoeng Loop, and farther afield to Pai and Mae Hong Son, or Doi Inthanon, or Chiang Dao. If going for more than an hour or two (it is 90 minutes to Chiang Dao, and several hours around the Samoeng Loop), then consider a larger motorbike, such as a 500cc. For around town, a ride to Chiang Dao (best to overnight at Chiang Dao Nest 1), then a 125cc is fine. Don't try Pai on a 125cc (esp. not with a passenger) unless very experienced (and with good kit and full face helmet).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Something Different Tour</b> 15 Soi 5, Kotchasan Rd.

They offer motor bike tours (along with other types of tours). Ranging from one day to four days. You can either drive the motorbike (if you have experience) or ride as an passenger. They also give you the option to ride off road; a great way to see the country side. The staff works hard to make sure each you have the best experience possible. This tour company is one of the non-touristy companies. Each tour is small and intimate, and you will get to experience a different aspect of Thailand. They also have a guest house where you can stay. Prices range from 100 baht for a dorm with shared bathroom and 300 baht for a two person room with your own bathroom. A true gem, when it comes to tour companies.</li></ul>

<p>Raft trips down the Mae Tang River are offered by organised by several companies and can often be combined with elephant riding or mountain biking. During the dry season (Jan-Feb) water levels are relatively low with only grade 2-3 rapids, but during the rainy season (Jun-Oct) higher water levels make for a more exciting grade 4-5 trip.

<p>Chiang Mai is home to many of Thailand's top tattoo artists. Beyond the traditional sak yant (Yantra tattoos), local artists have a wide arrange of specialties to suit your style. Before getting a tattoo, however, make sure to check the artist's portfolio to make sure that they have the requisite quality. Also, with a large number of tattoo shops in the city it is quite easy to stumble around and walk into a road-side shop. Though you might be better off booking ahead of time with the artist of your choosing.

<p>Chiang Mai is a great place to shop. Sprawling markets during the day and night carry items from cheap trinkets to skilfully made local craft. ATM's can be found all around, but all charge 200-220 baht to foreign cards, in addition to a less-than-favorable exchange rate. 
</p><p>Most places do not accept credit cards, except for shopping malls, upscale restaurants, major hotel chains, and the like. It is very much a cash society.

<p>Along Rt 1006 (Charoen Muang Rd) just past the superhighway (Rt 11) are located various factories offering tours of their manufacturing process and showrooms. Silverware, silk, furniture and brass items generally priced with the cashed up tourist in mind, but the tours might be worth a look to see how things are made. They are generally open during normal daytime hours.

<p>A stall or market that is very popular with tourists - especially 'farang' without much knowledge of the taste of genuine Thai food - can't be 'trusted' as a place to amaze your tastebuds. A stall that has plenty of local Thai customers is more likely to be authentic - though generally they might not seek tourists (their menu in all-thai emphasizes this) and speak no word of English - they can be worth the visit. These shops, which seem to have been along the canal at some point before the tourist boom, have moved to back roads or further away because of the increasing costs in rent. A basic understanding in Thai will be very useful in opening up a whole new range of gourmet possibilities.
</p><p>Chiang Mai's restaurants offer a wide range of food, second only to Bangkok. Naturally it's a good place to sample northern Thai food: in particular, hunt down some <i>khao soi</i>, yellow wheat noodles in curry broth,  traditionally served with chicken (<i>gai</i>) or beef (<i>neua</i>), but available some places as vegetarian or with seafood - see listings below. Another local specialty is <i>hang ley</i>, Lanna-style pork curry.  There is also a wide range of excellent international food restaurants, from cheap hamburger stands to elaborate Italian eateries.
</p><p>When you come to Chiang Mai you should try a <i>khantok</i> or <i>khantoke</i> dinner and show. Although these are just for tourists it is still a nice way to spend an evening. The first khantok dinner was held in 1953 by Professor Kraisi Nimanhemin who wanted to host a special event for 2 friends leaving Chiang Mai. Two more such dinners were held, both in 1953, thus "khantoke" dinners are not "historic",  but rather a relatively recent invention. Khantok literally means <i>small bowl, low table</i> (khan = small bowl. tok = low table) There are also many garden restaurants where you can enjoy an excellent Thai meal in a beautiful setting.
</p><p>The range and value of Western food in Chiang Mai is unsurpassed in Northern Thailand and there is a full range of restaurants from Australian/British/Irish, through French and German to Italian, Spanish, American and Mexican. In fact considering how remote Chiang Mai is from the major centres of population in Asia, it is remarkable how many Western restaurants there are! This is one city where eating Thai is not the only option.

It's a great break from the Saturday Walking Street market and is also right across the street from Chiang Mai Gate.</span> <span class="price">mains 40-50 baht</span>. </span></li></ul>

<p>There are three well known sources of decent Japanese at a reasonable price: Tsunami on Huay Gaew, Matsu on Singharat inside the moat, and Shogun in Sansai Noi. Matsu doesn't have sake, but their chirashi is amazing. Tsunami is known for their various rolls, and about half the menu at Shogun is excellent.

<p>Chiang Mai has an amazing selection of vegetarian restaurants. The <i>Chiang Mai Vegetarian restaurants map</i> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.facebook.com/chiangmaivegetarian2006">[34]</a> lists over 50 places. Many other places will offer vegetarian food as well, but be aware that they often don't care if there are some animal ingredients in the food any way (i.e. shrimp paste, fish and oyster sauce). This is only part out of ignorance because even the local Buddhist monks themselves often eat fish. (Thus, asking for your dish to be prepared "like the monks", which works in other places, does not get the same results in Chiang Mai).

</p><p>Chiang Mai's nightlife scene is the most happening in the North, although still a far cry from Bangkok's hot spots. This guide will show where you can hangout, get outrageous or do whatever takes your fancy. There are discos, karaoke bars, and live music everywhere. The busiest nightlife zones are near <b>Tha Phae Gate</b>, <b>Loi Kroh Road</b> and along <b>Charoenrat Road</b> on the eastern bank of the Ping River.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bars_and_pubs">Bars and pubs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Chiang_Mai&amp;action=edit&amp;section=73" title="Edit section: Bars and pubs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Many, but by no means all, of Chiang Mai's tourist-oriented bars and pubs are located along <b>Loi Kroh Road</b>. In addition to the street bars, the <b>Chiang Mai Entertainment Complex (CMEC)</b> can be found at the Night Bazaar end of Loi Kroh. Here you will find around 30 bars ranging from sports bars that feature big screens to watch sports and play pool, to Pattaya-style girlie "beer bars", to even bars staffed exclusively by kathoeys (ladyboys). The complex also features a muay Thai boxing ring with mandatory entrance fees and one or two actual matches, and after that clowns and ladyboys. 
</p><p>Also take a stroll along <b>Moon Muang Road</b> and its side sois. Here you can find small expat hangouts, go-go bars, and sports bars. Most have pool tables and hostesses, along with music videos or various TV sport programmes. Be aware that despite their charm and friendliness, the pressure to purchase lady drinks can end up with a very surprising "check bin" (tab) at the end of the night. A few of these bars recommended by expats are:
</p>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="2Gether_Bar__Restaurant"><span class="fn org">2Gether Bar &amp; Restaurant</span>,  (<span class="note directions">Loi Kroh Soi 1, just past Number 1 Bar, on the left</span>). <span class="hours">open 11.00-1.00</span>. <span class="description">Very reasonable prices, 10-30% less than others in the Loi Kroh neighbourhood. This bar/restaurant has a very good atmosphere. The host is the charming Mai. There is a free pool table, but don't expect an easy game if she is playing. A little-known fact about this place: it serves terrific food. A true undiscovered gem in Chiang Mai. E.g., large baguette sandwiches for less than 100 baht.</span> <span class="price">Leo beer, 65 baht</span>. </span></li></ul>

<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Next_Place"><span class="fn org">Next Place</span>,  (<span class="note directions">on Moon Muang Rd, on the inside of the moat right near Tha Phae Gate</span>). <span class="description">No pressure to buy lady drinks, free pool for customers and friendly staff</span> </span></li></ul>

Take a pass if you are looking for something memorable.</span> </span></li></ul>
<p>There are also some regular bars with a <i>normal</i> atmosphere: 
</p>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Caf_Souvannaphoum"><span class="fn org">Café Souvannaphoum</span>, <span class="adr"><span class="street-address">20/1 Ratchamanka Rd</span></span> (<span class="note directions">near Moon Muang</span>), <span class="tel"><abbr class="type" title="voice">☎</abbr> <span class="phone value">+66 53 903 781</span></span>. <span class="hours">M-Sa, 17:00-01:00</span>. <span class="description">A decent wine bar with comfortable seating and relaxing music, great escape from the busy street scene.</span> </span></li></ul>

Imported Blackthorn Cider and Fuller's London Pride as well as Belgian and German beers. Pub favourites including bangers 'n mash, fish 'n chips, steak &amp; kidney pie as well as steaks and pasta. International and Thai food. Menu in 7 languages including Japanese and Chinese. A great place to relax after shopping at the Night Bazaar. Live sports on a HD big screen including Premier League Football, Aussie Rules, Rugby and Formula 1 (weekends only) and a great selection of classic pop and rock videos from the 60s to the 80s during the week. The Red Lion is also the home of The Chiang Mai FC Expats supporters club. They meet two hours before the match at the pub. Visitors welcome. A free ride to the game is usually available.</span> </span></li></ul>
<p>West of the city centre,  the area around <b>Nimmanhaemin Rd</b> is a popular hangout for younger Thais, perhaps due to its proximity to Chiang Mai University. The pubs tend to straddle a fine line between bar, restaurant, and nightclub, and feature loud music interspersed with live bands fronted by musicians who are most likely hitting the books in the daytime. Tourists looking for something racier are better off staying in the east side of town. Little English is spoken in this part of town. Little doesn't mean none, however, and the staff of many bars, being students, still can understand what do you want, or even sometimes can speak reasonably well.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Mo'C Mo'L</b>, Huay Kaew Rd. Pub and restaurant near Chiang Mai University, there are many zones in the restaurant: coffee shop, dining outdoors near the small pond, dining indoors with live music.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Monkey Club</b>, Nimminheimin Rd, Soi 9. +66 53 226997-8. Another hot spot for students and 20-somethings, with a variety of live music. Open 17:00-01:00.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Warm Up Bar</b> This chain bar/restaurant/club has several venues in Thailand. The venue in Chang Mai is a lot less touristy and the dance hall packed to the brim of Thai students.</li></ul>
<p>Many smaller (usually no live music, but offer TV, generally with football or other sports) roadside Thai bars around this area, but outside of more up-market Nimmanhaemin Rd, they are cheap (50 to 65 baht for a large Chang or Leo is common). Often they have a discount if you buy 3 bottles of their proffered beer at one go, with a price of 129, 119, or even 109 baht for all three. The posters about those "promotions", if any, are in Thai language only. If you can't read Thai, look for the numbers mentioned above, and, if in doubt, ask the staff. Often (if they can speak enough English) the staff will tell you about this offer themselves, if they have one. Expats sometimes can be seen in those small bars, but generally most of the customers are Thais.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Live_music">Live music</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Chiang_Mai&amp;action=edit&amp;section=74" title="Edit section: Live music">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The area along the east bank of the Mae Ping River on Charoenrat Rd is famous for jazz, rock, pop, Thai, and country and western live music, along with restaurants serving Thai, Western, and Chinese food. Coming from the centre of the city, just walk from the night bazaar across the Narawatt Bridge, from where all the restaurants can be seen along the river on the left.
</p><p>Most bands in Chiang Mai play for about an hour, and then move on to do the same at another restaurant or pub, so don't be surprised to see the same band twice if you switch venues.

<p>Chiang Mai has sprouted a thriving coffee culture, having an abundance of roadside stalls to Starbucks-style chains seemingly every few metres. The dilettante baristas consistently squeeze out a decent cup from their electric machines regardless of the price or opulence of their premises. A standard espresso or long black (Americano) at a street side stall is 30 baht, iced around 35 baht and upwards of 45 baht for more elaborate milk and sprinkles. Espresso based drinks at air-conditioned locations are usually 50 baht and up.

<p>Accommodation in Chiang Mai is generally cheap, even by Thai standards. All types of lodging are available from inexpensive guesthouses with little or no service to the typical high rise hotels and elaborate garden resorts. The latest boom is Thai-style boutique resorts located near the old city centre. Several have been built since mid-2005. They offer excellent service in quiet garden settings. Most are fairly small with as few as 8 rooms and a pool, and are decorated with Thai crafts and antiques. Prices are going up as more travelers are visiting the city. 
</p><p>Hostel dorm rooms with A.C. could go for as little as 180 but you have to search them out. Budget hotels start at 400 but most charge 500 or more for a double room with AC and private bathroom. 
</p><p>Some of the cheapest accommodation may refuse guests who are not also booking a trekking package. If so, please remove them from Wikitravel.
</p><p>Evenings in Chiang Mai are cooler than Bangkok and the south during the dry season, so air conditioning may be less of a priority.
</p><p>In recent years, hundreds of Airbnb properties have opened up in Chiang Mai. Studio apartments and 1- or 2-bedroom apartments can generally be booked for less than 1,000 baht per night, though larger or more luxurious accommodations can be more expensive.
</p><p>For long-term (more than 1 month) visitors, simple but comfortable studio rooms (20-30 sq.m. with air-con, TV, fridge, outside window, parking, often WiFi [charged separately]) should cost 4,000 to 6,000 baht/month, plus utilities. Many of the best value places are located in the northwest (between Huay Kaew and Chang Phueak Rds, especially behind the superhighway) of the city and around Chiang Mai University (including the highway west of the airport), but there are some in other parts of the city as well. Some may offer daily rates (400-600 baht). Pay attention to the price of electricity when comparing. While the official price is just over 3 baht/kWh, almost all apartments/condos charge 5 to 10 baht, typically 6. More luxurious rooms and apartments are also available, for the price, and are more likely to be found online. New: Mentioning electricity is a bit of a scam; its business overhead and shouldn't concern travelers. When guesthouse owners speak of this either ignore or look for other places as there are abundant choices (2014).

<p>Chiang Mai invariably finds itself at the top of travel magazines’ international surveys, and is no longer the sleepy northern Thai village it was a few decades ago. Although the city still retains its cultural charm, it has developed into a modern, fully-developed destination in its own right, complete with many excellent hospitals and treatment facilities, resorts, spas, wellness centers, alternative healing retreats with a distinctively northern Thai flavor. 
</p><p>Medical tourists are increasingly choosing Chiang Mai as their destination of choice for all types of procedures and treatments, including medical, dental, and cosmetic procedures. Aside from the pre- and post-treatment tourism options, the costs are generally lower, the weather is milder, and the overall stress factor is ratcheted down a few notches, perfect for rest and recovery. 
</p><p>Chiang Mai hospitals, aware of the increasing numbers of medical tourists heading north, have geared up to meet the challenge. Many offer special medical tourism packages for international patients and have upgraded their staff and facilities to handle the needs of visitors from different countries. At the forefront of this trend is Chiang Mai Ram International Hospital.
</p><p>Chiang Mai Ram is the top choice for medical tourists, as it can handle the most complex procedures such as cardiac care, knee replacement, sexual reassignment surgery, and other very specialized medical treatments. It is also well-known for its cosmetic and dermatology departments. Its quality and standards have been recognized internationally, and it is JCI accredited. 
</p><p>In addition to popular dental treatments such as teeth cleaning and whitening, root canals, crowns, and implants, Chiang Mai now has a number of superb dermatology centers and skin-care clinics that specialize in treatments including facial-rejuvenation and hair and cellulite removal. Although Chiang Mai Ram is the north’s flagship hospital, there are a number of other long-established, well-regarded hospitals in Chiang Mai; these include: Chang Puak Hospital, McCormick Hospital, St. Peter Eye Hospital, Lanna Hospital, and Rajavej Chiang Mai Hospital. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mymedholiday.com/country/thailand/chiang-mai">[35]</a>
</p><p>Chiang Mai is also an excellent dental tourism destination. In fact, many visitors prefer Chiang Mai over Bangkok for a number of reasons, especially for more serious, multi-visit procedures. Chiang Mai offers virtually everything that Bangkok has, but the prices for both the treatment and the cost of living in Chiang Mai is less.

<p>There are laundromats and laundry services all over town, but they all wash cold. There is a laundromat that has 3 machines that can do hot washing as well on Chaiyapum Rd (road along the moat from Si Phum corner to Tha Phae Gate) about half way between Sompet market and Tha Phae Gate. Opposite there is a cafe from where you can watch your stuff while having a beer.
There are multiple pick up and return laundry services offered in Chiang Mai, WashDrop and EM'S Laundry Service both cover a large area of the old and new city. Collecting from home, office and hotel the business offers a full range of laundry services including dry cleaning and same day wash. Prices are normal and the pick up/return is free. Good English is spoken and laundry is returned clean, fresh and on time.

<p>As always, travellers should take extra care in all poorly lit or more remote areas. Don't carry valuables in a bag after dark as one common tourist-related crime here is bag-snatching by men on motorbikes. Mind your bag especially if you are walking on a dark street at night. Other violence against foreigners is not about theft but consists of deliberately causing traffic accidents or yelling racist insult in the hope of starting a fight.
</p><p>The safest approach is to act like your Thai hosts and wear reasonable clothing (shoulders and chest covered), medium-length skirts, long shorts or long pants, speak in a moderate tone of voice, and avoid flashing money or jewellery. Respectable Thais appreciate your behaviour but many people in Chiang Mai don't care and you can still easily become a target of criminal activity.

<p>Unfortunately some scams from <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> have started to rear their ugly heads in Chiang Mai. Two in particular are worth watching out for: the <b>gem scam</b>, where you are talked into buying near-worthless gems at far above their real value; and the <b>tuk-tuk scam</b>, where a smooth-talking tuk-tuk driver tells you that the attraction you want to see is closed, and instead offers you a sightseeing tour for 20 baht (or some similarly unrealistic number). Needless to say, the tour will either consist of nothing but overpriced gift shops, or will smoothly segue into the gem scam. See the "Stay Safe" section of the <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> article for more details.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Smoke">Smoke</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Chiang_Mai&amp;action=edit&amp;section=91" title="Edit section: Smoke">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Chiang Mai's smoke levels can be discomfiting, and sometimes dangerous, during rice field-burning season, approximately from early February well into April. The whole of northern Thailand and neighboring Myanmar and Laos often falls under a thick pall in this period, with hundreds of thousands treated for smoke inhalation. There are typically dozens of deaths. For example in 2007, 58 people died of smoke-related heart attacks. If you intend to visit at this time, you are well-advised to check on smoke levels in advance. Thousands of residents (foreign and Thai) leave Chiang Mai at this time to escape the smoke. The government is apparently uninterested in fixing the problem: in 2007, famously blaming it on Korean barbecue restaurants, which were then all closed down! Presently, the 'solution' is to spray the streets with water to 'moisten the air' (which actually does have an effect on reducing the ppm of airborne pollutants). There is little political will to tackle the burning of rice fields, which is the cause of the smoke. In March 2012, dangerous PM10 particles measured over 200 mcg per cubic metre of air in Chiang Mai, well above the 'unsafe' level of 120 mcg (the Thai government standard, which is more than twice the maximum level set by the <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=World_Health_Organization&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="World Health Organization (page does not exist)">World Health Organization</a> ( <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=WHO&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="WHO (page does not exist)">WHO</a> ) at 50 mcg). Neighbouring areas were as bad or worse (Chiang Rai for example was at 306 mcgs), so moving on to a neighbouring province will generally not help. The pall of smoke stretches from northern Laos, across Thailand, to eastern Burma.

<p>Tap water should be regarded as non-potable.  Liquids from sealed bottles nearly always are safe, and should be used wherever possible. Nearly all restaurants use ice made by professional ice-making companies and is generally safe. There are street side water vending machines (50 setang to 2 baht per litre) throughout the city. Using one saves money and a lot of plastic refuse, but the quality of the water varies greatly from one machine to the next.

<p>Chiang Mai is home to a large number of stray dogs (sometimes called "soi dogs"). The vast majority will leave you alone if you do not disturb them, particularly during the day when the heat makes them sleepy. Some, however, can be very aggressive and territorial, and while their bark is often worse than their bite it is not unheard of to be bitten (this writer speaks from first-hand experience - see also stories such as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.chiangmaicitynews.com/news.php?id=263">Chiang Mai News: Dog Attacks Woman at Chiang Mai Temple</a>). Avoid entering the grounds of empty temples after dark, when the stray dogs that monks have taken in will often be in guard dog mode, and if surrounded by a pack of barking dogs at any time of day be sure to calmly and slowly walk away.If you find yourself cornered with 1 or 2 dogs not so near, reach to the ground as though you have picked up a stone and raise your hand behind your head as though you are going to throw the imaginary stone, and jerk your hand forward as though you are about to throw it. Usually enough to make 1 or 2 dogs run off. Tried-and-tested as most Soi dogs will have been on the the receiving end of a stone or the bluff, so they know what you appear to be doing.
</p><p>If you do get bitten, always flush the wound with as much water as possible, apply alcohol-based hand sanitiser if you have it on you, and go immediately to the A&amp;E department of the closest hospital. Even the tiniest bites, if the skin is broken, can cause rabies, and the hospital will take this very seriously. Remember that even if you've had rabies jabs in your home country before coming to Thailand, you will still need post-exposure vaccinations as quickly as possible.

<p>With so many sights to see in the surrounding areas, it can be very tempting to hire a motorbike in Chiang Mai. If you're a capable and experienced motorcyclist - go for it and have fun! If not, then think very carefully about the risks involved. Thailand's roads are home to an exceptionally high number of motorbike accidents, and although Chiang Mai roads are certainly not as hair-raising as somewhere like Bangkok, they are no place for a beginner. Do not put your own life, and the lives of others, at risk.
When renting a motorbike always make good picture of both sides of the bike as some people will try to rip you off. Please add any company where you had problems with to the blacklist.

<p>Touristic attractions that rely on animal exploitation run rampant. Please avoid endorsing such places, shows, or so called “conservation” projects ("Help us to help them!", sounds familiar?), as even most of the latter are little more than just touristic attractions with little or no real intention of actually helping to release or even protect these animals. If you are considering volunteer positions or day tours with elephants, thoroughly do your research before making any commitments.
At some bars and touristic spots some people may offer you to take your photograph with animals, even baby animals, in exchange for money. Please remember that the most likely way (and many times the only way) these babies were acquired were by poachers killing the mothers, or the entire family. Endorsing this practice only leads to more demand, and more killing.
Moreover, some of the species used are endangered and protected under Thai law, which makes the possession and abuse of many of these animals illegal.

<p>Many guest houses, hotels, cafes, shopping malls, and even swimming pools, offer Wi-Fi connections.  These are usually free or available for a small charge. If you are travelling with your laptop you should be able to connect to the Internet within a 500 m radius of your Chiang Mai city-based accommodation at little or no cost.
</p><p>In November 2012, the Ministry of Information announced the launching of 3,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots in Chiang Mai. The program, called <b>ICT Free Wi-Fi for the Public by AIS</b>, offers a download speed of 10 Mbps for up to five hours a month. Hotspots can be found near schools, shopping centres, hospitals, and government offices. Those interested must sign up for the free service at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ais.co.th/ictfreewifi">[36]</a>, after which you will receive a user ID and password. This service is not unlimited however, and is restricted to a number of hours per month.
</p><p>Internet cafes abound and can be found everywhere within the city. Prices vary from 10 baht/hour (in "gaming" places filled with local kids) to 60 baht/half-hour (2 baht/minute) and up. Most places charge per 15 or 30 minute block, others by the minute. The cheapest and most comfortable places with fast connections, webcam, microphone and Skype, can be found along Huay Kaew Road near the main entrance to Chiang Mai University, where the cost is 10-20 baht.
</p><p>Unlimited (though not spectacularly speedy) 3G wifi can be had for low package prices (399 THB/mo and up) with only a one-month sign-up period from most vendors (AIS, True).

A popular place to pop over border for a few hours before renewing your Thai visa. Note that there are no consular services so you cannot get a new visa here.

The Myanmar fee for a same day entry permit is 10 USD or 500 baht (so it is better to use USD).
