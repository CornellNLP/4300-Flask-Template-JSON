<p>Bogota experiences one of the most pleasant climates found in the world due to its location close to the equator and high altitude (2,650 meters or 8,660 feet). The city has very little temperature variations year-round and daytime highs are usually around 20°C (68°F) and nighttime lows are between 5-10°C (42-50°F). Subzero temperatures don't occur every year but can happen in the city's high altitude neighborhoods. Temperatures above 25°C (75°F) are also pretty uncommon. The record low and high is -5.2°C (22.6°F) and 30.0°C (86°F) respectively. Bogota also experiences wet and dry seasons with the rainiest months being March, April, May, October, November and December (all of them having an average of above 80-90 milimeters) and the driest month is July with an average of 35 milimeters. Snow is virtually unknown but hailstorms may occur. There is also a lot of fog with around 220 foggy mornings annually.

<p>The city is served by <b>El Dorado International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>BOG</b>), about 20 minutes from downtown in a taxi in good traffic.
</p><p>There are two terminals: <b>Terminal 1</b> is much larger and houses all international flights plus most domestic flights.   <b>Terminal 2</b>, also called <b>Puente Aereo</b>, only serves EasyFly and Satena. 
When one approaches the airport by car Terminal 2 is going to be the first one to encounter, on the right. The walk between the two terminals is long and not covered by a roof. There is a free shuttle. 
</p><p>It receives several flights daily on Avianca from New York City, Washington Dulles, <a href="/en/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a>, <a href="/en/Orlando" title="Orlando">Orlando</a>, <a href="/en/Fort_Lauderdale" title="Fort Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a>, <a href="/en/S%C3%A3o_Paulo" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="/en/Madrid" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>, <a href="/en/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="/en/London" title="London">London</a>, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Mexico City, <a href="/en/San_Jos%C3%A9_(Costa_Rica)" title="San José (Costa Rica)">San José</a> (Costa Rica), <a href="/en/Lima" title="Lima">Lima</a>, <a href="/en/Buenos_Aires" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="/en/Panam%C3%A1_City" class="mw-redirect" title="Panamá City">Panamá City</a>, <a href="/en/Quito" title="Quito">Quito</a>, <a href="/en/Guayaquil" title="Guayaquil">Guayaquil</a>, <a href="/en/Oranjestad" title="Oranjestad">Oranjestad</a> (Aruba), <a href="/en/Willemstad" title="Willemstad">Willemstad</a> (Curaçao) among others.

</p><p>All flights for EasyFly and Satena are served from the <b>Puente Aereo</b> terminal 2 which features WiFi access to the Internet from almost every location. 
</p>
<ul><li>EasyFly <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.easyfly.com.co">[8]</a> with regional flights.</li>
<li>Satena <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.satena.com/">[9]</a> (small planes fly to typically tiny, isolated destinations across Colombia).</li></ul>
<p>The airport also offers free yellow fever vaccination (you will be given the yellow booklet) which is not mandatory in some areas of the country Colombia (only isolated areas in the country are endemic for this disease). 
</p><p>To get from airport into the city there are a couple of options:
</p>
<ol><li><b>Regulated taxis</b>. Taxis are reasonably priced and safe from the airport. You first have to search for a stand where you will have to point out your destination and then they will print out a ticket indicating the price you will have pay. Then, pick up a taxi from the line and explain to the driver your destination. At the end of the journey you will have to pay ONLY what is printed out in the ticket. The typical price will range from COP20,000 up to COP35,000. There are men in civilian clothes who offer the "Uber" service. They take you to the parking lot and take you in a car. Remember that this service is not Uber and can be dangerous. Just take official taxis from the airport. In the city only take an Uber that you requested with your app.</li>
<li><b>Transmilenio</b>.  Bogotá's bus rapid transit (BRT) system runs along El Dorado avenue, so it is now possible to use the system to get into and out of the airport.  You can only use the system if you have small luggage - you might not be allowed into the stations if you are carrying big suitcases - if you want to try your luck though, the airport line is the most permissive. To get out, find the "Alimentador" (feeder) stops in front of the main terminal or the Puente Aéreo (if you travel with Avianca) - they are green buses with "Transmilenio" painted on the side.  This bus will bring you for free to the main "Portal El Dorado" station. There, you can buy a Tullave card to enter the system (COP5,000) and then charge it with any amount of money (each ride costs COP2,300). You can keep the card for as long as you want and you won't have to buy it again until you lose it. Use Moovit to find directions and avoid Google Maps, the directions are outdated and unreliable.  The "Alimentador," bus number 16-14, services "Portal El Dorado" station, Puente Aéreo (at the main roadway curb, not the arrivals curb, just after vehicle traffic passes the taxi stand), El Dorado terminal (at the arrivals curb, about half way along the straightaway between where vehicle traffic enters the covered area and where the airport concourse begins to curve, there are big signs to guide you) then returns to "Portal El Dorado" station.  At "Portal El Dorado" station, passengers must take an underpass between the Transmilenio platform and the feeder platform.  Travellers on Transmilenio can get to the Eldorado bus station by taking any bus number starting with the letter "K", or the route 1.  To get downtown and to La Candelaria, you should take route 1 headed to Universidades and once you're there you can take an underpass to Las Aguas station and get out there. If you're going north, take any route that starts with a B.</li>
<li><b>SITP Urbano Buses</b>. The blue SITP route P500 stops at the Airport.  Before boarding, buy the Tullave card. The ride costs COP5000 (about USD1.60), and riding the bus costs COP2100 (around USD0.70) and you can link with the Transmilenio system on the 63rd Street (E line) or on the 72nd Street (all the other lines) - you can transfer to any station for COP200, or to another blue bus for free (you have 95 minutes once you pay your first fare).</li>
<li><b>Private Transportation</b>. Hire private transportation. You can schedule it upfront online. There are several private companies like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://moveo.co">Moveo</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.tedecol.com/">Tedecol</a>, and more. That way you can get around the city with a private and reliable chauffeur.</li></ol>

<p>The safety of bus travel in Colombia greatly improved prior to 2007, and nowadays is the main transport option between towns for most Colombians. However, foreigners, as most locals do, should be cautious not to travel to areas of unrest and conflict areas, and may also want to restrain to the major or touristy cities, there is no actual difference in travel by night or day, and incidents and encounters with illegal forces are now unheard in major routes. Do not carry large amounts of cash with you as robberies are not totally unheard of. Service in the 'upscale' buses is very good and they are very comfortable. Pick the most expensive service (just a couple of dollars extra) as these buses tend to be bigger, newer and in better mechanical condition. 
</p><p>There are three main bus terminals:
- The main one, called Terminal del Salitre or Terminal de Transporte, located about 10 minutes away from the airport.
- The southern one, called Terminal del Sur, which is about 45 minutes away with good traffic, which is not usually the case.
- The northern one, called Terminal Satélite del Norte, which is about 45 minutes away but pretty far.
Most buses start their journeys at the main terminal, and then they stop on the other terminals, depending on their destination, and then they continue their journey.
</p><p>Currently, buses run in and out of Bogota's main station, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.terminaldetransporte.gov.co/"><b>El Terminal de Transporte de Bogota</b></a>. The station is clean and has standard amenities. Located at Calle 22 B, No 69-59, multiple bus companies have regular routes to destinations around the country. To get there from the airport, you can take a short taxi ride, since its really close. If you travel light and already have the "Tullave" card (COP5000), take a Transmilenio bus to "El Tiempo-Maloka" station (After taking the "Alimentador" to "Portal Eldorado") and walk about 6 long blocks (18 minutes), so check a map in advance (not unsafe, but not advisable at night hours).
</p><p>Take into consideration that most of the restaurants serving within the terminal can be expensive by Colombian standards, but well served. In case of need, it may be advisable to order a dish for 2 people or just to check places around the station.
</p><p>The Terminal is divided in several colour-coded and numbered areas ("Módulos") that indicate the destinations to which companies in that area travel to&#160;: 1 = Yellow = South, 2 = Blue = East and West, 3 = Red = North and International, 5 = Purple = Arrivals.
</p><p>To buy tickets, the most common way for locals is arriving at the corresponding area and asking in different companies. Nevertheless, this is almost certainly impossible to accomplish in holidays and long weekends, where you'll need to buy the ticket in advance to avoid hours long lines with a high possibility of not getting a ticket at all. To do this, you may go to the terminal as well and buy the ticket for the day you need, or as most locals do, go to the closer official office of your favourite company for your route. You can also call to the company for reservations, feel free to ask help with your hotel. These days, some companies have online buying services, as "Bolivariano", or use fare aggregators such as Pinbus or Redbus.
</p><p>On the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.terminaldetransporte.gov.co/home/index.php?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=12">Government sponsored search engine by destination</a>, simply enter destination (<i>Destino</i>) and a list of companies (<i>Empresa</i>) serving that route will be returned along with average prices. 
</p><p>Some common bus companies in Colombia that are found in this Terminal are: 
</p>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.bolivariano.com.co/">Expreso Bolivariano</a>&#160;: This company has one of the most extensive networks. Some international destinations as well.</li>
<li>Coomotor <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.coomotor.com.co/">[10]</a>&#160;: Mostly destinations in Southern Colombia.</li>
<li>Copetran <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.copetran.com.co/">[11]</a>: Destinations to Northern Colombia, as Caribbean coast "La costa" or the extreme sports capital of Colombia, San Gil, Santander.</li></ul>
<p>Besides the main central terminal station, Bogotá also has a far south terminal.  The area is way off the tourist path, but it is easily accessible via the Transmilenio G line.  If you want to use this terminal, get to Portal del Sur station and change to a 'Terminal Sur' feeder for free.  The green bus will drop you off at the entrance of the terminal, which is generally cleaner and less busy than the Salitre Terminal.  It also has signs in English everywhere and since many buses coming from the North Terminal stop here anyway, you might want to use it.  Do not venture outside the terminal though, there is nothing to see and the area is poor and potentially dangerous for foreigners (and locals).
</p><p>There's also a northern terminal that's pretty far to the north, but easily and directly accesible, as it is served by the "Terminal" station. Here, you can take a bus to northern areas such as Santander or Boyacá.

<p>The city of Bogota is built on a grid system. A rather imperfect one, actually. Chaotic urban sprawl in the second half of the twentieth century, mostly driven by violence in the countryside and the immigration that ensued, made the city develop without any effective longterm urban planning (or, in some cases, just plain bad urban planning). This has resulted in a lot of irregular blocks, twisting streets, and diagonals cutting across what is supposed to be a perfect grid. Therefore, the apparently straightforward street address system has historically been more of a guideline as to where things are than a precise way to get to places. A recent (as of 2012) update of the street addresses in much of the city was directed towards solving some glaring inconsistencies in getting around. Most places that tourists visit are easy to find nowadays, but you have been warned.
</p><p>Carreras (streets) are abbreviated as Cr., Kra., and Cra. and run parallel to the mountains from South to North. Carrera numbers increase from East to West, away from the mountains - so Carrera 7 is near the mountains and Carrera 100 is far from them - except for a very few carreras near the mountains that increase in reverse order and that have names like "Carrera 1 E" ('E' standing for East).
</p><p>Calles (also streets) cross the carreras and run from East to West. Calles are abbreviated as Cll. and Cl. For half of the city (the northern half tourists are most likely to visit) calle numbers increase from South to North - so Calle 13 is near the center of the city, whereas Calle 200 is one the last streets before exiting Bogota on the northern side. Calles in the southern half work similarly to 'East' carreras near the mountains: the southern calle numbers increase from North to South, mirroring streets in the northern half. These are called things like "Calle 85 S" ('S' standing for South).
</p><p>Aside from calles and carreras, there are 'diagonales' and 'transversales'. As their names suggest, they are not perfectly parrallel to calles and carreras. However, the same numbering system applies to them. Diagonales are supposed to be deviations from calles, whereas transversales are supposed to be deviations from carreras. So, for example, Diagonal 107 runs sort of East-West and is somewhere around Calle 106 or 108.
</p><p>Avenidas, abbreviated as Av. or Avda., are usually larger, main streets. Geographically speaking, most avenidas somehow fit into one the four categories mentioned above, although some avenidas twist around. They usually have a classification and number as described above, but they also have a distinct name, like "Avenida Suba", "Avenida Boyacá" and whatnot. So, for example, Avenida Jiménez is a main street and, in the number system, is also called Calle 13, or the "Avenida NQS", union of three Avenues ("Av. Carrera Novena", "Avenida Quito" and "Autopista sur"), which in turn, in certain sections take specific names, as "Carrera 30", "Transversal 35", "Avenida Calle 45A Sur", "Avenida Calle 57R Sur".
</p><p>Each address consists of a street and a series of numbers. For example, Cl. 45 24-15 (sometimes written as Cl. 45 # 24-15 or Cl. 45 No. 24-15), means (1) the location is on Calle 45, (2) of the two insecting carreras nearby, the one with the lower number is Carrera 24 (since in this case we are talking about carreras, it means the nearest carrera to the East of the location; if we were talking about calles, it would be the nearest calle to the South of the location), and (3) the location is roughly 15 meters from the interesection of Calle 45 and Carrera 24. Furthermore, since the last number, 15, is odd, the location is on the North side of Calle 24 (if the location were on a carrera, it would be on the East side of it). Even numbers at the end have the opposite meaning.

<p>Despite taxi cabs being ubiquitous and affordable, travelling by taxi in Bogotá entails many risks. The most dangerous is arguably the "Paseo Millonario" (Millionaire Ride), in which the cab driver picks up his accomplices along the way and together they take your valuables, including money from your credit/debit cards, forcing you to withdraw cash from ATMs until your withdrawal limit is reached.  To add insult to injury, they can keep you past midnight and withdraw your daily limit a second time.  In June of 2013 a DEA agent was robbed and murdered by one of these gangs when he hailed a cab on the street after leaving a pub <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.latinospost.com/articles/21942/20130621/james-terry-watson-dea-special-agent-murdered-during-colombia-robbery.htm">[12]</a>.To try and avoid this, do as most conscious locals do, only use cabs by calling by phone service (ask your hotel or see below), or in places like the airport, bus terminal and big malls, go to the official stands for this service.
</p><p>As if that was not bad enough, taxi drivers can be unprofessional and not very courteous. Expect loud music, reckless driving and overcharging.  They tend to react badly towards complaints, and the Police emergency line (123) will not take complaints related to them.  If you feel that you've been overcharged try to negotiate, but don't push too hard, lest your driver becomes aggressive and starts calling other drivers on the radio for backup, which is known to have happened.
</p><p>If, however, you do need to use a taxi in Bogota, bear in mind the following: it is dangerous to flag them on the street, so reach them by phone at 599-9999, 311-1111 or 411-1111 (or use the Tappsi<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://tappsi.co">[13]</a> or EasyTaxi<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.easytaxi.com">[14]</a> apps). If calling for a taxi, the driver will want to confirm that it is you who called by asking for a "clave" (key), which is always the last two digits of the phone from which you called to request the taxi. Each taxi has a meter which should increment one tick every 1/10 kilometer or 30 seconds and starts at 25 ticks. The rate chart is printed on a card in the taxi. As said before, some drivers may try to take advantage of you in one way or another, so be sure the taxi meter is started when you begin your trip. Tipping is never necessary - be sure to count your change and be on the lookout for both counterfeit coins and notes. There are surcharges for the airport, holidays, and nights (after 8PM). Surcharge details are printed on the fare card. Surcharge for ordering a taxi arriving at your house is currently 600 pesos, surcharge after 8PM is 1.600 pesos, even if you are starting your trip before that time. Holidays and Sundays are also surcharged 1.600 pesos. Lock the doors of the taxi and keep your windows rolled up, especially after dark. Always check the fare card to ensure you are not being overcharged.
</p><p>You can check the history of a cab using the license plate number on <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://denunciealtaxista.com">denuncie al taxista</a>. Avoid taxi cabs with bad reviews.

<p>Uber has seen very strong growth in Bogotá, particularly among those seeking a more secure alternative to local taxis. You must have a smartphone (iOS or Android) to download the app and request rides. While rates for local taxi services can be cheaper, there are less concerns regarding personal safety/theft. The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.uber.com/cities/bogota">Uber Website</a> provides a list of up to date rates and information. However, Uber has been declared illegal by the national government, and therefore the service given by all the vehicles in the name of the company.  If an Uber car (white vans or sedans with black-on-white plates) is stopped by the police, the driver will probably say that he works with a hotel, and will probably ask you beforehand to say that you were picked up at a hotel if asked by the police. Most Uber drivers will ask you to sit in the front so that taxi drivers will not recognize the car as an Uber. Gangs of taxi drivers have been known to attack suspected Uber drivers while police officers stand by and watch.

<p>Transmilenio, Bogota's rapid bus service is generally affordable, clean and efficient. It carries commuters to numerous corners of the city in exclusive lanes ("troncales<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://transmilenio.gov.co/es/servicios-troncales">[15]</a>"), bypassing the infamous city traffic; however, there are some main routes that are not yet reached by Transmilenio. Fares cost COP2,300 (about USD0.75) in Trasmilenio or COP2,100 (buses). You need a "tullave" card to ride the Transmilenio or the busses which can be purchased for COP5,000 (about USD1.60) and topped-up at any Transmilenio station. Smaller "Provisional" busses which take cash and only cost COP1,650 during the day and COP1,700 at night and on holidays, however there are no timetables for these busses and they are usually very crowded, they can also be hailed at pretty much any point on their route so you don't have to wait at a bus stop.  
</p><p>Buses in exclusive lanes all have bus numbers that start with a letter.  The letter is an indicator of where each route line terminates.  Each of the bus routes in the exclusive lanes has a sister bus route that travels in the opposite direction with a different bus route number.  Signs at each bus station show the list of sister routes and all of the stops along the way where the buses will be stopping. Buses do not stop at all stops between the terminuses.
</p><p>The vehicles used in that systems are articulated red buses; they are fast and relatively safe, but are normally full during rush hour - plan your trip accordingly.  The system also uses different kinds of stations: the <b>simples</b> offers bus services at the right and left sides (north-south;east-west) and the <b>intermediates</b>  are usually located in middle points and have complete services, such as elevators, station libraries, bikes parks, restrooms.  <b>Alimentadores</b> services  (buses that reach zones the articulated buses do not) and the <b>portals</b>, the 7 arrival and departure places of the buses, are located near the entrances to the city. Service ends averagely at 10 or 11PM. Additionally, intercity buses from the metropolitan area also arrive at these stations.
</p><p>The <b>SITP</b> (Integrated Public Transport System) is an extension of the Transmilenio system, although technically Transmilenio is one of its components.  It intends to become an integrated system which will, amongst others, replace the old private bus system.  SITP Urbano buses are blue and they use the regular lanes, not the express Transmilenio lanes. The main routes can be found here: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sitp.gov.co/publicaciones/rutas_del_servicio_urbano_pub">[16]</a> (the most touristy areas are in Usaquén and can be reached by routes 37 to Unicentro, 283 to Chico Norte, 488 to Unicentro and E44 to El Virrey - tourist areas in Chapinero, including City Centre, can be reached by routes 579 to Centro Internacional, 494A to Parque Bavaria, C13 to Marly and others).

<p>Privately owned buses cruise all the main thorough fares and many side streets, and are the principal form of transport for the working and student classes.  Though they do follow specific routes, they do not have bus "stops"; you merely call to them like taxis and they will stop for you where you are standing.  Placards in the large front windows list destinations, either districts or main street names.  Upon entering you will be asked for the fare; if you are not travelling alone you may be asked "Para ambos?", for example, meaning "For both?", to see if you are paying for just yourself or for your companion.  Then you pass through a turnstile to the seating areas.  Check the change that you are given back: drivers often try to take advantage of foreigners by giving them less change.  The buses come in three sizes, usually, long (like a school bus), medium and small (called busetas).  All have turnstiles.  To exit these buses, you go to the back door and either push a button located usually on one of the hand rails or next to the exit, or simply call out "Aqui, por favor!" or "Pare!" (Stop!).  Passengers are often expected to embark and disembark even from the middle of the street.
</p><p>Sometimes vendors are allowed to enter the buses to sell candy or small gift items (occasionally donating one to the driver for the privilege).  Or, you may find entertainers such as singers or guitar players, and even the more creative of the street beggars who will regale you with a long, poetic story of their sad situation before asking for donations.  Even in the smallest buses, cramped full of people standing and sitting, it is a common sight.  Interestingly, Grammy winning (2009) singer Ilona got her start performing on buses around Bogota.
</p><p>The cost for riding on a private bus is usually 1550 COP during the day and 1600 COP during the night (as of August 2015).

<p>Colectivos cover practically every major route of the city, and can generally be flagged down at any point on a main road. Watch these small buses for lists of destinations displayed on their windshields, or ask the driver (in Spanish) if he passes the neighborhood or intersection you are going to. Not very comfortable, but they are faster than a common bus and it's also used as a shuttle for routes that don't have so much affluence, it can take you almost anywhere.

<p>Bogotá has Latin America's largest network of bicycle routes, called 'Ciclorutas.' On Sunday's and public holidays, many main and secondary roads are closed to cars for the <b>Ciclovia</b> 07:00-14:00, a special feature of Bogotá, where people can run, bicycle, inline skate or just watch from the side. There are refreshment stands along the way and most parks host some type of event such as yoga, dancing, stretching, spinning, etc. To get a bicycle you can rent a bike or do a guided bike tour of Bogota's Ciclorutas by tour operators and bike rental shops; these include <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.bogotraveltours.com">Bogotravel tours</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.bogotabiketours.com">Bogota Bike Tours</a>, both located in La Candelaria. The Ciclovia is a fun and healthy way to get to know the city, and to get closer to the people.

<p>Many landmark events in the history of Colombian and South American independence took place in the La Candelaria, district including the near killing and escape of Simon Bolivar, the execution of revolutionary heroine Policarpa Salavarrieta, known as 'La Pola,' and the Grito de Libertad, known as the beginning of the region's revolution. And the district is indeed teeming with history, and there are a lot of interesting museums and old churches in what is the oldest Bogotá neighborhood. Some streets are reserved to pedestrians. The most important places are La Catedral, Plaza de Bolivar, Palacio de Nariño, Iglesia del Carmen, Biblioteca Luis A Arango (blaa), the Colonial Art Museum and the old architecture of the houses and buildings, almost all of the museums charge no admission. La Candelaria also contains numerous Catholic Churches, many of them centuries-old. The Colombian-American and Colombian-French cultural centers are located in La Candelaria, and a Colombian-Spanish cultural center is under construction.

You can take the Funicular up and Transferico down, or vice versa.  You have the option to buying one way tickets, too.  You will have the most amazing views and also enjoy Colombian or French food in the two full-service restaurants at the top.  There are also souvenir stalls on the weekends.  Remember to bring a warm coat, because it is chilly up there. On Sunday is a very crowded place, so be ready to get into a long line. Locals have their group wait in line to get on the funicular while someone else queues op to buy the tickets at the same time. It feels a bit like skipping the line, but everybody does it so you might as well do it too.  It is very important to also wear sunscreen and hat because at such a high altitude, you will burn very easily even if it is "cloudy". This is especially true if you are going around noon.  You can also hike up the stone-set path up Monserrate like the locals do without any additional costs.  It takes approximately 1-1.5 hours up and approximately 45 minutes down.  Remember to allot more time if you are not accustomed to being 2 miles above sea level. There have been reports of muggings, so beware when you do the climb and if you can, go at weekends when the way is much more crowded and police officers are posted every hundred meters or so.

<p>No visitor to Bogota skips the historic <b>Downtown</b> and La Candelaria neighborhood. In fact most affordable lodging and dining options can be found this side of town making it highly desirable by low-budget travelers and backpackers, given its close location to many of the city's attractions. Start your way on Avenida Septima and Calle 16, just arriving Parque Santander. Take the opportunity to visit the world famous Museo del Oro, or <b>Gold Museum</b> for its legendary El Dorado collections. Then continue south one block to <b>Avenida Jimenez</b> (Calle 15) and give your camera a workout at one of Bogota's most famous and historic intersections, where a couple of ancient churches and 19th century buildings collide. Turn east (towards the mountains) and walk up Avenida Jimenez alongside downtown's famous <b>Eje Ambiental</b> or <i>Environmental Axis</i>, which is a section of the avenue that has been closed off to vehicles except Transmilenio, to make way for a generous tree-lined pedestrian sidewalk and an enclosed water stream. Many historic and famous buildings are located alongside the Eje Ambiental, home to Bogota's most renowned and traditional companies like El Tiempo and the Bank of the Republic. A few blocks east just past the <b>Parque de los Periodistas</b> the Eje Ambiental starts bending northwise, so leave the axis and turn south instead via one of the small streets that branch into the neighborhood and make your way up to Calle 13 and Carrera 2, el <b>Chorro de Quevedo</b>, unofficial center of La Candelaria, where it is argued that the City of Bogota was founded back in 1538. Today, bohemian life meets to enjoy arts, culture and music at this spot. On the way make sure to take in the whimsical coloring and architecture of the neighborhood's streets and colonial houses. Continue on Carrera 2 southward a couple of blocks up until Calle 11, and turn west once again just in front of La Salle University: You'll be glad you do since you've been climbing constantly eastward so enjoy your walk back down. Make sure to notice the eccentric street names found on picturesque signs at every corner. Make your way down west on Calle 11 and you will pass by the <b>Museo Botero</b>, museum  showcasing some of famous Colombian painter Botero's private art collection and work. Another block down is the <b>Centro Cultural Garcia Marquez</b>, modern cultural center and venue that includes Library, Art Galleries, concert halls and lesson rooms, with year-round events and displays for all tastes and audiences interested in culture and the arts. Continue down west and reach the <b>Plaza de Bolivar</b>, the city's overwhelming main square surrounded by neoclasic government palaces and the <b>Catedral Primada</b>, largest church in the country. After taking in the many sights, you might want to leave the square southbound for a couple of blocks on Carrera Septima to check out the <b>Presidential Palace</b> and its Presidential Guard. Don't forget to visit the newly reoponed Plaza Nunez, which lies in between the Presidential palace and the National Capitol. Sorrouding by historic buildings, including the historic building of the national astronomic center, the Santa Clara Church and museum, both over 500 years old, as well as taking in the majestic republican and neo-classical arhitceture and monuments, sorrounding the Plaza. Finally turn around back Carrera Septima northward until you find Transmilenio, just about where you started!

Salsa music is a very important side of nightlife scene in Bogota,  unlike in american and dancing clubs, salsa music in Bogota is not only for experienced dancers, music collectors or any specific group of individuals. You can see on a 1 to 3 stops tour how local people actually  live salsa, it means dancing, eating, partying and listenig life music. You need no prior experience at dancing salsa to enjoy a salsa tour since there are always dancing lessons included as part of the activity. There are also places to buy food and drinks when the tour does not include it. On the other hand, Bogota Salsa Tour goes further than partying and dancing, during the night you will learn about history of Salsa music, dancing styles and almost everything you need to understand why is Salsa so popular in the world.

Sit down in a 'panaderia' (bakery), order a "colombiana" brand soda and some good bread...sit down and breathe the environment of the regular Colombian...don't narrow yourself to the upscale Norte. Since picking out one of these neighborhoods can be dangerous, the best ones to do so: Santa Isabel, 20 de Julio, The Tunal area.</li></ul>

There is a paved path from the bottom all the way up that takes around an hour and you can walk back down or take the teleferico/cablecar back. You should only really do this on a weekend when its busy as during the week robberies are likely. <b>Quebrada La Vieja</b>. Just above Calle 71 and the circunvalar ring road is a path that leads up into the hills behind Bogota. It is monitored by police and therefore it is only open from 7am until 9am (exit is possible until 10am) on weekdays and Saturdays. The views over Bogota from the top are great.</li></ul>

<p>The Spanish spoken in Bogotá is neutral and clear. The accent varies from region to region. If you know the basics, you'll probably be fine.  Bogotá is full of English academies and bilingual schools, so English is spoken by many young people. The most "touristy" areas are full of young students who go to bilingual schools, and generally, they will help you translate. Colombians love to show off the best of their country to reduce the negative image it has among foreigners.

<p>If you are going to stay in Bogota, keep in mind the location; Most <b>low-budget</b> visitors choose to stay in <b>La Candelaria</b>, the colonial neighborhood in the center of the city. There are many cheap, nice hostels where you can meet travelers from all around the world. The historic district as well as all the major museums and some nightlife options are within walking distance. Common precautions apply as in any major south american city&#160;: do not walk alone, carry as little cash as possible and leave the passport and credit card at the hotel. Pressure from neighborhood groups to oust the remaining criminals has caused police presence to increase but you must always remain cautious. Check the location very carefully before you choose a place to stay, security is worse in the tiny deserted streets uphill and closer to Egipto neighborhood. You'll find several hotels in the upscale <b>northern districts</b> like Zona T or Parque de la 93. Security won't be such an issue but prices are much higher. Nevertheless, you won't have any problem hailing a taxi at 06:00 in the morning because your hotel would be just around the corner from the nightclub (keep your eyes open though - thieves hang around tourist areas at all times and they are most active at the time people start leaving the nightclubs). On the other hand, you can find low to medium price hotels around downtown or near universities (i.e. Chapinero Neighborhood).  
</p><p>Note than most hostels carry a strict no drugs due to the negative effects that these activities have on Colombians and their way of life. Cocaine use not only supports armed battles but also destroys Amazon rain-forest through its production. Child prostitution is also a current issue for many hostels and hotels who are fighting to prevent this from becoming a way of earning an income for young Colombians.

The hostel is usually over-crowded and the facilities are too old, beds are neither good nor clean and hot water is not stable. Prices seem like overcharged as there are better hostels around. However, it's still the most famous place in La Candelaria. The hostel offers free coffee, internet facilities and hot showers. Included in the Platypus portfolio are Platypus 2 and 3, where those wishing to stay for longer can take advantage of having their own room at discounted rates. Make sure you book for Platypus in advance as they very seldom have availability on arrival. The best reason for staying here is German's knowledge but he is rarely around nowadays (*At the time of writing, in June 2009, travelers get robbed every night near Platypus. As the location is well-known for local robbers, usually they await victims in front of Platypus at night. Better to avoid staying at Platypus at the moment).</span> <span class="price">Dorm bed&#160;: 18,000 COP / Private rooms from 33,000 COP</span>. </span></li></ul>

Lockers, hot showers, communal computers, Billard, TV, guitar, free coffee/tea, kitchen, lots of bathrooms, and great common area on second floor with glass ceiling. However breakfast is quite light, the wireless internet is sometimes spotty, and the upstairs dorms are located around the common area with practically no sound attenuation. Therefore cheaper upstairs dorms are not ideal for early light sleepers</span> <span class="price">Rates starting at 27,000 COP for dorm with 10 beds</span>. </span></li></ul>

<p>For a perspective on safety concerns in Bogota, consider that Bogota has a crime rate far lower than most other Western cities of its size including New York, Mexico City, and Los Angeles. Despite having had something of a bad reputation about its safety during the 70s and 80s, Bogota is not at all as unsafe as it was once depicted of having. The truth is that the city has a highly capable police force (one of the biggest and most well-equipped on the hemisphere) and is generally considered to be a "safe city" by the World Bank and the US department of state. Kidnappings and violent robberies are a thing of the past and should not be a concern to tourists whatsoever. Like in most major cities, there are the ocassional pickpocketers or street muggers, but just following general guidelines (don't go into dark alleys at night) should keep you safe. Bogota is as 'dangerous' as an average global city of its size (which means that you shouldn't be more alert in Bogota than you are in cities such as London or Tokyo). There should be absolutely no safety concerns in the Northern parts of the city mainly in the districts of Zona T, Zona Rosa, Rosales, Parque 93, Usaquen as these areas a very frequently visited by tourists from all over the world. Common sense is all you really need. There are no real "dangerous" areas in the city, as all the main tourist attractions, museums, monuments, galleries, etc tend to relocated in safe areas. The very few somewhat shady neighborhoods there are in Bogota shouldn't be a concern to vistotrs at all, as these tend to be found more towards the southern suburbs, often lining the outskirts of this enormous city. Keep in mind though that in Southern Bogota, rougher neighborhoods can be separated by upscale ones by a mere 5-6 blocks. Try to always know where you're going and don't wander aimlessly. Heading east-west when north and even south in the city is safe, wherever you go and regardless of the time of night. Simply put, behave like you would in any city.  
</p><p>There are occasional <b>pickpockets</b> in the city, but again this depends on the area and where you are i.e on public buses. Always be very careful of your belongings in crowded buses and in the TransMilenio. Don't carry uneeded cash with you and always have a copy of important documents like passports or IDs in case they are lost. Avoid having very ostentatious clothing items on streets as these tend to be the target of pickpoketers.  Like in any city pickpockets disguise themselves in a crown and when your not noticing take a waller or something from your pocket, so when you surrounded by a crowd of toursticts in the Historic Center or any other monument, museum, etc in the city, be more careful of your belongings. When in the street try not to leave any <b>personal belongings unattended</b>, for any reason. 
</p><p>The occasional taxi robber can be a problem in Bogota. A few taxis in the city don't belong to the official companies and this means they aren't regulated. If you enter one of these taxis in best case scenario you'll get a tour of the city you didn't ask for but in any other case your personal safety is in danger. Taxi drivers like these have been known to take tourists to ATMs around the city to withdraw money. If you need a taxi download the Tapsi and Easy Taxi apps and order one, or order an Uber. Though be mindful that even legitimate companies may have drivers with questionable backgrounds so be on your guard.
</p><p>Some  <b>ATMs in Bogota</b>  in specific areas of the city can be the target of pickpockets. Again, this is heavily dependant on the neighborhood you're in. Don't withdraw money from random ATMs on the street in a dark alley. Use ATMs inside banks or streets that are with other people, preferably withdraw money with maximum amount per transaction due to charges. 
</p><p>Bogota's nightlife is very famous and many tourists visit its world-renowned bars, restaurants, and salsa, cumbiam, tango, and reggaetton dance clubs at night. Very rarely an event known as <b>drink spiking</b>  happens in bars and nightclubs. While the issue is definitely not as widespread as portrayed by the media, it's better to be more or less prepared in bars, restaurants, etc in some (not all) neighberhoods in southern Bogota. Just use our common sense, don't accept drinks from random strangers in the street. When returning home from restaurants and bars past 1 AM it might be worth considering taking an Uber of cab, but if you are at a walking distance that is fine as well.
</p><p>Muggings aren't very common the city however in the rare occasion that it happens, it isn't recommended to get in a fight with your robber just give them what they want - it is not worth getting potential hurt for things that  are material, recoverable things (unless they are expensive and cannot be recovered, especially if your passport, or any other ID, is stolen). Muggings are over in seconds and the robbers normally do not check what they have gotten. So handing them over just your purse might satisfy them and you can keep your back bag or vice versa. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Areas_to_be_careful">Areas to be careful</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bogot%C3%A1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=44" title="Edit section: Areas to be careful">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>However prepared you might be in Bogota there are some areas of the city that should be either completely avoided or traversed with caution. Here's a rundown of the neighboorhoods:
</p><p><b>La Candelaria</b> - La Candelaria in the day is teaming with people and tourists alike that come to see the historic center of Bogota with their own eyes. But La Candelaria IS NOT SAFE at night. Never walk alone after 9pm, always catch a cab back to your accomodation and tell the driver to wait until you're buzzed in. This is for safety reasons as thieves have been known to lurk around hostels and waiting to be buzzed in alone, with your back on the street puts you in a dangerous situation. Always keep an eye out and beware of anyone hanging around the door. The number of pickpockets and muggings tends to somewhat increase at night, especially when police do not patrol this area, if at all. 
</p><p><b>Montserrate</b> - Montserrate is one of the most beautiful places in the city and visitors flock to catch the teleferico up to see the view. The last cable cars are at around 7pm and many people come down after seeing the sunset. If you do it, don't walk back to La Candelaria at night. Occasional muggers know the descending tourists will have their cameras with them. Even if you're in a group, when it's past 11 o'clock, you should try to catch a cab back to your hotel or hop into the free shuttle that leaves every 15 minutes from the bottom of the teleférico to the Las Aguas TransMilenio station between 5pm - 11pm. Sunday is the best time to scale the mountain as many locals will head to the hilltop church for services. Montseratte tends to be very safe (in broad daylight, at least).  
</p><p><b>South-Eastern Bogota</b> - South-Eastern Bogota is the area with the highest pickpocketing and occasional muggings in the city. Tourists should be more careful in these areas of the city, mainly in the borough of Ciudad Bolivar, and should follow the general rules of safety for any major city. Avoid going into dark alleyways, especially at night, as well as darkened streets, and don't go into abandoned or decaying buildings, as they are a common place for homeless people and street gangs alike.

<p>Bogotá's water is drinkable and of great quality. Foreigners may want to mix bottled and tap water for the first few days, though. In most part of the city the water has the taste of chlorine, which does not impede its drinkability. Bogotá has no tropical diseases like malaria because of its altitude and no mosquitoes either. <a href="/en/Altitude_sickness" title="Altitude sickness">Altitude sickness</a> is, in fact, the largest health problem affecting foreigners. Generally, a few days without hard physical activity or time spent in a mid-altitude city like <a href="/en/Medell%C3%ADn" title="Medellín">Medellín</a> will do the trick. If you have heart disease or a respiratory condition, talk to your doctor. El Dorado Airport provides wheelchairs for travellers with special needs. Private hospitals offer excellent health care.

<p>There are so many great places to see within a couple of hours of Bogota, and for people that have spent a lot of time in the city, getting out is a necessity! It's also easy to find a completely different climate zone, and if you've spent any time in Bogota you'll know that it isn't so warm -- so a muggy poolside <i>finca</i> might be just what the doctor ordered! 
</p>

<ul><li>Visit nearby towns like Chia, Cajica, Guatavita, Tabio, and <a href="/en/Zipaquira" class="mw-redirect" title="Zipaquira">Zipaquira</a>. You can find cheap and fast transportation to any of these destinations either from the <b>Terminal de transportes</b> in El Salitre or the Transmilenio's <b>Portal del Norte</b> bus stop.  By all means, try to circumvent rush hour for the part of your journey that runs through Bogotá: you might find yourself spending 2 hours in the bus just trying to leave the city. From most, you can return the same day. But it's a good idea to get out, Bogotá is a chaotic city surrounded by lots of relaxed and peaceful places.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Further afield is the popular colonial town <a href="/en/Villa_de_Leyva" title="Villa de Leyva">Villa de Leyva</a>, 2-3 hours north. In that direction you could also visit Tunja, Paipa and Sogamoso.</li></ul>

A visit is by guided tour and takes around 2 hours. English, German, French, and Spanish-speaking guides are available. Spanish tours depart every 30 minutes, for English tours you have to wait longer. To get there you can take a share or private guided tour or take the Transmilenio to <i>Portal del Norte</i> and then a bus to Zipaquirá (2 hours / 5,750 COP). There is also a tourist train, doing the journey from central Bogotá to Zipaquira via Usaquen (40.000 one way). Consider taking a taxi when arriving in Zipa(4000 COP), as it is a 20-minute uphill walk from where the bus drops you off. You can walk back through the town and enjoy nice views. The current cathedral is the second construction and opened in 1995 after the first one had to close because of safety concerns. The other lesser known salt mine in the valley that you can visit is <b>Nemocon</b>, in a charming town with pictures painted all over the town's buildings.</span> <span class="price">Entrance&#160;: 20,000 COP with student ID or COP 35,000 adult</span>. </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Andrés Carne de Res</b> (Restaurant and nightclub) Amazing steak and a great place to party.  Do not miss it if you want to see how important food and dancing is for Colombians! Very mixed crowd of all ages. As expensive as the branch in Bogotá. Calle 3 # 11A -56 Phone: 863-7880 (Chía) Live music is one the best "rumbiaderos" (nightclubs). It is located about 20 mins north of Bogotá by car or around 1 1/2 hours by Transmilenio (to Portal Norte) and public bus (to Chia) from La Candelaria.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Suesca" title="Suesca">Suesca</a> is a local adventure sports hub, with bouldering and climbing available everywhere. There are also tour operators who organize rafting trips to the nearby rivers. Around 1h north from Portal Norte by public bus (7.000 COP).</li></ul>
<ul><li>North of Bogota, in the hills above Sopo lies <b>Pionono National Park</b>, which has great day hikes from where you can look down on Guatavita Lake on one side and the northern Bogota suburbs on the other side. It passes through the unique high alpine ecosystem similar to the larger <b>Chingaza National Park</b> to the east (also a good day trip, but you'd need private transport for that). Buses to Sopo from Portal del Norte, and either walk (a long way) to the top of the hill or hire a taxi in Sopo. Sopo is also the location of the Alpina milk factory.</li></ul>

<ul><li>The amazing road to <a href="/en/La_Calera" title="La Calera">La Calera</a> goes up from central Bogota with beautiful views over the city and used to be one of the most popular night spots in the city. Students on <i>Chiva</i> party buses are now the most frequent visitors at night.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Choach%C3%AD" title="Choachí">Choachí</a> is the best kept secret in town. This small village 50 minutes east of Bogotá is reached after climbing up and down a tall mountain, so tall you can see Monserrate at your feet. Local cooking, hot springs (20.000 COP) and a great Swiss restaurant await for you at your destination. Buses go from the <i>Tercer Milenio</i> Transmilenio station.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Laguna_del_Cacique_Guatavita"><span class="fn org">Laguna del Cacique Guatavita</span>, <span class="tel"><abbr class="type" title="voice">☎</abbr> <span class="phone value">57 + 1 + 2826313</span></span>. <span class="hours">Closed every Monday. If Monday is a holiday, then it is closed Tuesday</span>. <span class="description">This spiritual lake is where the legend of El Dorado originated. The Muisca Indian Kings used to have religious ceremonies in the middle of the lake. They were pushed on a float to the middle of the lake, all their bodies covered in gold dust, and threw gold offerings as sacrifices into the lagoon. English/Spanish guided tour is available. The journey will take little more time than to Zipaquirá (depending on traffic, expect to spend between 1 1/2 and 4 hours for the one way). Go to Transmilenio's North Portal and find the inter-municipal route within the Portal to Sesquilé/Guatavita.  Let the driver know that you intend to go to the Lagoon and he'll drop you off at a point where you have to walk - it's quite a hike on a steep hill, but people going by car will often pick you up and take you to the entrance if you ask. Of the little information available on site, all is translated to proper English. One reconstructed typical house of the Muisca people can be found close to the entrance. Otherwise, it's just a 1 hour walk to the lagoon and back again. Without a guide the place might seem not very interesting to you. There is also a pleasant small village called Guatavita, located directly at the edge of a big reservoir, just a few kilometers away from the lagoon.</span> <span class="price">Foreigners&#160;: 13,600 COP / Colombians&#160;: 8,800 COP</span>. </span></li></ul>

<ul><li><a href="/en/Melgar" title="Melgar">Melgar</a>, La Mesa and Giradot are small cities approximately 100 km southeast of Bogotá and together comprise the by far most popular weekend get-away for Bogotá's upper class. Melgar is known as the "City of Thousand Pools", due to the abundance of private vacation homes that have their own swimming pool. The climate is very hot and humid (around 30 to 35° Celsius) and therefore these places are the perfect place to get a dose of heat coming from always cool and chilly Bogotá. Nothing else to see there though. Catch a bus from Terminal de Transporte in El Salitre. The journey will take you between 2-4 hours, depending on the traffic situation.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>La Vega</b> lies down a spectacular winding road in a cute little valley. Horseriding is popular, and there is supposed to be a butterfly park there somewhere.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The very little known <b>Tobia</b> lies the west past La Vega (around 2-3 hours) where white-water rafting, rapelling and caving is popular and well-established.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="South_of_Bogota">South of Bogota</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bogot%C3%A1&amp;action=edit&amp;section=55" title="Edit section: South of Bogota">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<ul><li><b>Salto del Tequendama</b>. The site where the Rio Bogotá falls appromimately 80 meters down the edge of the high plateau. Less than one hour with public transport from Portal Sur. A old, beautiful hotel was reopened as a museum after years of renovation. The stink of the Rio Bogotá, which almost surely is the most polluted river of Colombia, will likely make a visit to these falls a rather unpleasant experience.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Parque Natural Chicaque</b> is a beautiful, privately owned natural reserve close to the Bogotán suburb of Soacha in the south, more or less a 1h drive from the Transmilenio station <i>Portal Sur</i>. At weekends and public holidays, sometimes there is a shuttle service leaving from Portal Sur to Chicacque and the other way round (7.000 COP). Also you can take a tour or private transfer service to Chicaque with travel companies like; Bogotravel tours located in La Candelaria. Check their website for the timings. There are various ecological paths crisscrossing the natural reserve, that encompasses true cloud forest. Longest hike to a Cascade takes around 5 hours and covers 8 km. Many shorter walks on nice natural stone paths available as well. Restaurant and possibility to spend the night in tree houses or the lodge in the heart of the park. Very costly though. Entrance fee: 12.500 - 13.000 COP, depending on the season.</li></ul>
<p>Bogotá is a hub to visit other places in Colombia. As the capital city is centrally located you can easily visit many distinct destinations such as the Amazon Jungle (1.5 hrs by plane), Spanish colonial cities <a href="/en/Cartagena" class="mw-redirect" title="Cartagena">Cartagena</a> or <a href="/en/Popay%C3%A1n" class="mw-redirect" title="Popayán">Popayán</a> (1 hr flight), modern cities like <a href="/en/Medell%C3%ADn" title="Medellín">Medellín</a> located in an impressive Andean valley or <a href="/en/Cali" title="Cali">Cali</a> at the foothills of the Andes. 
</p><p>To get to the airport from the city, you may use taxi or a public buseta (van). A way to get by public transport is either to go to the Calle 19, which from the Candelaria where most foreigners tend to stay, is only 4-5 blocks away. Catch a bus that says "Aeropuerto". Or go the Avenida 26 which is the street that goes directly to the airport. Also look for buses that state "Aeropuerto" there. This journey may take around 45 Minutes from the city center depending on the traffic conditions, but is significally cheaper than taking a taxi anywhere in the city (1.300 COP vs. around 25.000 COP).  The Transmilenio K10 route will drop you off at Portal El Dorado, and you can board a green Alimentador bus from there to the Airport and the Puente Aéreo.
