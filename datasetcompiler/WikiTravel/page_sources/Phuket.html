<p>Phuket nestles in balmy Andaman Sea waters on Thailand's Indian Ocean coastline 862 kilometres south of Bangkok. 
Phuket formerly derived its wealth from tin and rubber, and enjoyed a rich and colourful history. The island was on one of the major trading routes between India and China, and was frequently mentioned in foreign trader’s ship logs. 
</p><p>In recent times, though, Phuket's top earner has been tourism, which has transformed the island into Thailand's wealthiest province.  Expect prices to be a bit higher than on the mainland. The west coast of Phuket was hit severely by the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, but almost no evidence of the damage now remains.
Phuket enjoys great popularity as a travel destination. Most beaches are on the west coast, with <a href="/en/Phuket_Town" title="Phuket Town">Phuket Town</a> to the southeast and the airport in the north.

<p>Phuket is hot and humid throughout the year. The hot season is generally considered to be from March to early May. During the summer monsoon season from May to October, mornings and afternoons are still sunny and clear, but it tends to rain in the evenings and water clarity goes down. Locals consider November to February the "cool" season, and the weather is quite tolerable, much more so than in the tourism centres around the Gulf coast. It's comparable to Florida's summer weather in temperature and intensity of rain storms: 25-33°C, flying clouds, short and thunderous rainfalls in the afternoons and evenings. Surfing is possible off the western beaches.

<p>Phuket is a melting pot of indigenous Thais, Thai-Chinese, ethnic Malays and even sea gypsies. The majority of the population in the rural areas is Muslim. Outside of the provincial town, the rural folk speak with a thick Southern dialect which is difficult for even other Thais to understand. The provincial town’s economy having boomed over the past decade has led to a lot of the youngsters leading similar lives to those in Bangkok. Altogether, the lifestyle of the urban Sino-Thais in Phuket resembles that of their counterparts in Bangkok.

<p>Several domestic airlines fly  from Bangkok Donmueang Airport (DMK) to Phuket (HKT), including Nok Air <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nokair.com">[12]</a> ,Thai Air Asia <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airasia.com">[13]</a> , Orient Thai <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.flyorientthai.com">[14]</a>,Thai Lion Air <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.lionairthai.com/">[15]</a> . Tickets from either of Bangkok's two airports can cost around 1,300 baht one-way if booked well in advance, or around 2,000-2,500 baht (including taxes) if bought on the day of the flight.
</p><p>Thai Airways <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thaiair.com">[16]</a> flies from Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) several times every day, as well as once daily from <a href="/en/Chiang_Mai" title="Chiang Mai">Chiang Mai</a> (but there are <b>no</b> direct flights in the opposite direction). Additionally, they sell tickets from/to many domestic and international destinations with a stopover in <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>. They are usually cheaper (especially international) than if one books separate tickets. Cheapest (non-exchangeable and non-refundable, though taxes are refunded even in the unfortunate case of no-show, if you call them later) one-way ticket from <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>, as of April 2008, costs 2,320 baht. Worth checking if you book just a few days before flight, as low-cost airlines may cost only 200-300 baht less in this situation, but you get full Thai Airways service, and free on-board meals too.
</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.nokair.com/">Nok Air</a> flies to Bangkok Donmueang Airport six times a day.
</p><p>Air Asia <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airasia.com">[17]</a> fly from Phuket to Chiang Mai (CNX) direct, twice a day at 10:35 and 10:20, affording an opportunity to combine a beach holiday with experiencing the wildlife and exotic cultures of  northern Thailand. From Chiang Mai to Phuket, flights depart at 13:00 and 21:45. They fly to a city in Isaan as well, daily to Udon Thani (UTH) (handy for a trip into Laos).
</p><p>Bangkok Airways <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bangkokair.com">[18]</a> has a monopoly on direct flights between Phuket and U-Tapao-Rayong-Pattaya International Airport (UTP) and <a href="/en/Ko_Samui" title="Ko Samui">Ko Samui</a> (USM). They also have 6 daily flights from <a href="/en/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>. Fares are usually the same as Thai Airways, but sometimes they have very inexpensive promotional fares as low as 1,390 baht including taxes (that was a promotion in May 2011) when purchased on the airline's website. Bangkok Airways flights are usually less crowded and the entire journey is more relaxed, plus you can use their lounges for free even as an economy-passenger.
</p><p>IMPORTANT:
Thai Airways International and Bangkok Airways fly to Suvarnabhumi (pronounced: Soo-wan-na-poom), whereas Air Asia, Nok Air and Orient Thai fly to Don Mueang Airport (DMK). This may be of importance when you have a connecting flight.

<p>To get from the airport to your destination, there are several options:
</p>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.airportbusphuket.com">Municipal air-con airport bus</a> service (daily 06:30-20:45, every 60-90min) to Phuket Town bus terminal 1 (old bus terminal) 100 baht (Nov 2014) and takes roughly one hour (See <a href="/en/Phuket_Town#Phuket_International_Airport" title="Phuket Town">Phuket Town, airport section</a> for the timetable). Local buses run from there and Ranong St Market to all the major beaches until around 18:00 for about 25-40 baht. After getting off the respective bus, just cross the street and wait for the continuing bus there. It's a very convenient and comfortable spot, with no touts or hustlers, plenty of shade and a mini mart for drinks and snacks. The bus will stop anywhere along its route if you signal the driver clearly.<br />If you are going to take the municipal airport bus from Phuket to the airport in the afternoon (especially the 16:30 and 17:30 buses) you should allow yourself plenty of time. With dozens of school children getting on and off during weekdays and/or congested traffic the bus is frequently delayed.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://phuketairportbusexpress.com/en">A new shuttle bus</a> has been introduced which links Phuket International Airport with <a href="/en/Patong_Beach" class="mw-redirect" title="Patong Beach">Patong Beach</a> without the need to change in <a href="/en/Phuket_Town" title="Phuket Town">Phuket Town</a>. In the bus terminal in domestic departures this service is called Route P3. A single ticket which you buy onboard costs 120 baht and the service runs every 45 minutes commencing at 08:15 daily. The journey takes approximately 90 minutes to complete. The last bus leaves at 20:45 arriving in Patong at 22:40. The return journey from Patong to the airport commences at 08:00 with the last bus leaving at 19:00. The route runs via Muangmai, Thalang, Lotus Thalang, Monument, Boat Lagoon, Lotus Bypass and Kathu to <a href="/en/Patong_Beach" class="mw-redirect" title="Patong Beach">Patong Beach</a> and terminates at Banzaan Market which is located at the rear of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.jungceylon.com/index_en.aspx">Jungceylon Shopping Mall</a>. The additional journey time compared with a taxi to Patong (which takes about 40 minutes) may be of interest to travellers arriving on early morning flights who are unable to check-in to hotels until early afternoon and want something to do to wile away the time. There are also plans to extend the destinations to both Kata and Karon at a later date subject to sufficient interest in the service.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://phuketsmartbus.com/">Phuket smart bus</a> run from the airport and passes almost all popular beaches including Surin, Patong, Karon, Kata, and Rawai beach. If pay in cash, the fare will be fixed at 170 baht no matter how far you ride. However with Rabbit card (same card use at BTS sky train in Bangkok), you will pay based on distance which is significantly cheaper for short ride. Rabbit card is available for sales on bus. The return bus will leave Tesco Lotus Express Rawai beach (parking area between Seven Eleven and The Tesco) every hour.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Minibus services (basically door-to-door share taxis) are good value. They charge 100-180 baht per seat, and will get you to your destination much faster than the municipal/government buses. To Phuket Town, 150 baht is typical (it seems this line is outdated); to Patong 180 baht; to Kata Beach 200 baht. When you get off the plane, don't dally, because when the minibuses fill up, they leave. If you miss the first group of them, you may have to wait until the next plane comes in, because they don't leave until they're full. The minibuses will stop at a travel agent about halfway to Patong. They'll ask everyone to get out (you don't have to) and then they'll ask you where you're staying, and they'll try to sell you a hotel. You're not obligated to use the hotels they push. Just say you already booked a hotel, and tell them the name. They will inform the driver, and he/she will drop you off at the hotel. This is a little annoying, but it's over in 10 minutes, and you're on your way again. Any travel agent can arrange a minibus ride for the way back to the airport.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Meter taxi rate increased in Sep 2014 and apply to all journeys on the island. The new rates are THB50 for the first two kilometres, followed by THB12 for the following 15 kilometres and THB10 for every subsequent kilometre. In addition, a 100 baht surcharge will be imposed on every journey from Phuket International Airport to any destination. This particular fee is intended to cover the cost of implementing a call centre which passengers can call to order a taxi. However, as of Nov 2014, the service wasn't available yet. The 100 baht will instead be given to the driver. Furthermore, the 50 baht fee AoT (Airports of Thailand) impose for collecting passengers from any AoT operated airport continues. This means that the 39km journey from Phuket airport to Patong Beach for example will now cost 700 baht. Although more expensive compared with Bangkok rates, it does represent a reduction of at least 170 baht compared with the former 800-1,000 baht rate which dubious taxi drivers who belonged to criminal gangs were charging prior to the May 2014 military coup.</li></ul>
<p>Meter taxis will also be able to pick up passengers anywhere on the island without fear of reprisals by criminal gangs, most of whom have been arrested since the military crackdown began. Among those arrested was the former mayor of Patong Beach, Mr Pian Keesin who has been charged with taxi mafia activities.
</p><p>Departure tax is now <i>included</i> in the ticket price. The airport is notionally divided into Terminal 1 and 2, with some charter and low-cost operators using the second, but these are only a few hundred metres apart and connected by an air-conditioned walkway.

<p>There are no direct rail services to Phuket.<br />However, many trains leave from Bangkok's central station going south all the way to Singapore. The most comfortable are the sleeper trains (c. 685 baht for a berth in a 2nd class air-con car. Get off at Phun Phin railway station near Surat Thani and continue for another 5 hours by regular bus to Phuket. Do not buy the bus ticket until you actually see the bus and can make sure it is not standing room only as it picks up passengers at the popular Ko Samui ferry. If full, wait for the next one.

<p>There are two bus terminals in Phuket, the new number two a few Km north of the City and the old number one in the centre of Phuket Town (where the airport bus stops).
</p><p>From the new terminal go all the long distance buses, as well as some minibuses. Many of the buses and minibuses go to places close to here, such as Phang Nga, Krabi, Chumphon, Khao Lak etc. 
</p><p>From the old terminal go buses to Takua Pa, and minibuses to Phang Nga.
Also songteows go from here to all of the beaches, as well as a non aircon bus to Patong.  
</p><p>The most reliable buses from Bangkok are the public BKS <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.transport.co.th">[19]</a> buses from the Southern Bus Terminal and North-Norteastern Bus Terminal to Phuket. The journey takes 13 hours and costs between 650-950 baht.  There are also some private bus companies, Phuket Travel Tour, Bus Express, Phuket Central Tour and Phuket Travel Service. Most of these private bus companies like Bus Express and Phuket Travel Service can be booked in advance online. Advance booking is advisable because this type of long distance bus service has limited schedule per day. <a href="/en/Bangkok/Khao_San_Road" title="Bangkok/Khao San Road">Khao San Road</a> operations have a bad reputation for theft, often turn out to include a "surprise" transfer to a minibus at Surat Thani, and are best avoided. 
</p><p>Some private bus companies can be booked online as well. The government buses also have an agreement with ThaiTicketMajor to operate online bookings for their long distance buses, however, most of them require the tickets to be mailed or picked up at ThaitTicketMajor outlets, which are usually located in major cinemas in large malls.
</p><p>There are however reliable buses from Phantip (1970) concession (as name suggests, running on schedule for many years), running routes Phuket-Suratthani, Phuket-Koh Samui and Phuket-Koh Phangan. These can be booked in advance, and already include ferry fee where applicable. A route to/from Koh Samui would cost between 450 THB and 1,300 THB depending on the ferry class (slow car ferry or a speedboat).
</p><p>From bus terminal 1 to bus terminal 2 you can take a 10 baht pink songthaew (line 2) or Potong  (leaves every 30 minutes) . There are also 3 regular songthaew lines within Phuket Town, and both bus stations are served by them. There is a very useful big map just outside the bus stations (look around where the taxis are waiting at the old bus station and at the very rear, not towards the entrance at the new bus station) that displays the three songthaew routes within Phuket Town. Fare is 10 baht, last one at 19:00.
</p><p>Before exiting the Phuket bus terminal, grab a free Phuket map from the information window. While supplies may always not be on hand, the map is a great way to get your bearings before jumping-off.
</p><p>From both Phuket bus terminal to your final destination, you can take a motorcycle taxi, tuk-tuk, metre-taxi, or bus. A motorcycle taxi into Phuket Town will be about 20-100 baht; to most beaches 100-200 baht (hard negotiable). 
</p><p>Form Phuket bus terminal 1 you can take the local non aircon bus to Patong beach for only 40 Baht and it goes there quite slowly. It runs along Rat U Tit 200 Pee Road, which is the road inland on removed from the beach, and parallel. They are both one way streets. 
</p><p>At the both bus terminals, be aware the tuk-tuk and motorbike taxi touts very expensive fare to the beaches.

<p>Phuket is a large island and you need some form of transport to get around. Public transport is very limited and taxis and tuk-tuks are the only practical means. Another option, albeit more dangerous, is to rent your own wheels. Hotels generally offer shuttle bus services into Phuket Town, and also have taxi and car hire facilities. Phuket smart bus is the new addition to  local transport and is tailor made for tourist. The service is from airport to  Rawai beach and back goes along the coastline and covers all the beaches in west coast. You need the rabbit card of phuketpay to actually use the service, but the operator accepts cash also, though it will be more than what the actual fare is, but is still very cheap compared to other options available.

<p>Public transport within Phuket is limited to a radial network connecting <a href="/en/Phuket_Town" title="Phuket Town">Phuket Town</a> to the beach towns. There are a few full-size buses, but most lines are operated with <i><a href="/en/Thailand#Songthaew" title="Thailand">songthaews</a></i>, basically converted pick-up trucks serving as buses. The fare is 25-40 baht up on distance, and there are no set stops — they pick up and drop off as requested. Most local bus services operate at half-hour intervals and stop at around 18:00.
</p><p>Most operate from the local market at Ranong Road (Talad Sod or Ban San); those to major beaches go via Phuket Town bus terminal.  The main lines connect to <a href="/en/Patong" title="Patong">Patong</a>, <a href="/en/Kata" title="Kata">Kata</a>-<a href="/en/Karon" title="Karon">Karon</a>, <a href="/en/Chalong_Bay" title="Chalong Bay">Chalong Bay</a>, <a href="/en/Rawai" title="Rawai">Rawai</a>-<a href="/en/Nai_Han" title="Nai Han">Nai Han</a> beach, <a href="/en/Cape_Panwa" title="Cape Panwa">Cape Panwa</a> (for the Aquarium), <a href="/en/Mai_Khao" title="Mai Khao">Mai Khao</a>, and <a href="/en/Surin" title="Surin">Surin</a>-<a href="/en/Kamala" title="Kamala">Kamala</a>.  There are <i>no</i> "cross-beach" connections, and eg. travelling from Surin to Patong (15 min by taxi) requires an hour-long detour via Phuket Town.
</p><p>Upon your return, though, often the bus will drop you off not at the main terminal but at a bus stop somewhere in the middle of Phuket Town, where travellers will immediately be set upon by the rip-off tuk-tuk and taxi drivers. Tourists beware!
</p><p>It's not unusual for the tuk-tuk drivers at the bus terminal to tell arriving travellers that the local bus service has finished, even though it hasn't. The bus stop is near the market in the old town. From Bus Terminal 1, make a right onto Phang Nga Rd. Continue down Phang Nga until it terminates at Yaowarat Rd., then turn left.  Within a few steps you will see a roundabout. Once at the roundabout, keep right. By keeping right, you will find Ranong Rd. Within 100 to 200 m you will find the local bus stop.

<p>Phuket has three types of taxi — millions (or so it seems) of small <a href="/en/Thailand#Songthaew" title="Thailand">songthaew</a>-style minivans (usually bright red, occasionally bright yellow) called tuk-tuks, a much smaller number of conventional sedan-style taxis (yellow and red, with a "Taxi-Meter" sign on top), and random indistinguishable vehicles that serve as unofficial taxis.
</p><p>The minivans are universally referred to as <a href="/en/Thailand#Tuk-tuk" title="Thailand">tuk-tuks</a> (even though they have four wheels, not three). They have no meter, and their drivers are notoriously mercenary, so always agree a price beforehand and do bargain hard. Short hops around town shouldn't cost more than 40 baht, but good luck getting from Patong to Phuket Town for under 400 baht. Tuk-Tuks should be avoided whenever possible, these are run by what locals call the "Thai Mafia" and charge you 200 baht for less than 1km runs. 
</p><p>Metered taxis are a much better option when available, being safer, more comfortable, and usually cheaper than tuk-tuks. However, they are often hard to find, and during peak periods their drivers will also ignore the meter and demand flat fares. You can arrange one by telephone. It is highly recommended you insist your hotel gives you taxi meter phone number and keep on the front desk. Take the taxi meter land line number from the yellow booth at the right had side of ground floor of airport before you depart, approximately 150 meters to right as you exit arrivals. Use and promote metered taxis and give numbers to hotels and post to trip advisor to help others be safe.
</p><p>Finally, many beaches have little shacks with "TAXI" signs, sometimes unofficially supported by a hotel, offering quick transport at high prices. They are usually pricier than the tuk-tuks, with most fares exceeding 500 baht, but they are usually air-conditioned and more comfortable.

<p>There are also motorbike taxis (<i>motosai</i>).  While you should never hop on the back of just anyone's motorbike, motorbike taxi drivers wear bright numbered vests and are usually the cheapest way to go.  However, these are more dangerous than a tuk-tuk, for obvious reasons, and are not comfortable for long trips. However, if you just need to get around town, they are a great way to go.

<p>Renting a car or motorbike to explore the island on your own is a cost-effective way of getting off the beaten track. However, given the driving habits of most foreigners and the resulting carnage on Phuket's roads every year, the risks do demand careful consideration. Driving habits are Thai style ignoring all the rules and keeping going at all costs, not much worse than Naples, but like there it keeps traffic moving. Traffic lights have just made things worse in the last few years.
</p><p>Due to the geography of the island with its winding hilly roads and poor vision, Phuket certainly gets more than its fair share of accidents. In fact, the death and injury statistics are more than high. More than 10,000 people are injured and over 250 killed every year in road accidents in Phuket. Nine out of ten accidents involve motorbikes.
</p><p>Drive <i>very</i> defensively at first and watch what the locals do. Of course, it helps if you are accustomed to driving on the left side of the road, which in itself could be enough to distract some North American or European drivers. Be aware that many motorcyclists will drive on the wrong side of the road to cover short distances, and undertaking is a very common occurrence on Phuket roads. Driving under the influence of alcohol is both illegal and dangerous, and driving at night also increases the risk of accidents — even if you're sober, many others aren't.
</p><p>Motorcycle and scooter rentals start at around 200 baht/day, coming down to 150 baht/day for rentals of a week or more. Although both drivers and pillion passengers are required to wear helmets, this rule is sometimes ignored by locals, and tourists riding around without one are more likely to be taxed 300-500 baht (seems to be another rip-off for tourists, as the official fine for driving without a helmet is 200 baht) by the police if caught.  You must carry a valid driving licence with you, or you'll be slapped with a 500 baht fine.  Police can check for motorcycle licences, and not having the correct licence type may result in a fine. Your licence will be confiscated if you're fined, and returned when you pay the fine at the appropriate police station. There can be police check-points on the way, and regular check-point locations include the northern end of Patong Beach Road, Chalong Circle and the northern end of Karon Beach. If you do wear a helmet chances of being stopped should be low though.
</p><p>Renting a car usually costs between 1,000-1,200 baht if you want to go for an ecomonical one like a Toyota Vios (stay away from the jeeps). Several rental companies are located in and around the airport. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.avisthailand.com">Avis</a> is located within the airport while <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.hertzthailand.com">Hertz</a>,<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.taxiphuket.com">phuket taxi</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.nationalcarthailand.com">National</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.sixt.co.th">Sixt</a> are located within walking distance of the airport (across the road).

</p><p>Be careful to check the level of insurance on a hired car, as many local companies say they have 'full' insurance when in fact it is only a very basic level. Motorcycle rental generally includes little or no insurance, so take extra care if you decide to opt for the motorbike option.

<p>There are several small beautiful islands around Phuket such as Phang-nga bay, Phi-Phi island, Khai island, Racha island, Hae island or Coral island, Maiton island.etc. It is possible to charter boat to those islands from Rassada pier or Chalong pier, but may be too much expensive, so to buy the one day tour is a good idea. 
</p><p>Many tour agencies sell all-inclusive day tours from all over Phuket, and most everywhere else on Phuket Island. Prices for join group tours range from 900 baht/person to 3,900 baht/person. Quality and safety seem to match the prices paid.
</p><p>The cheaper speedboat tours take approx. 30-35 passengers per 2-engine speedboat and 50-60+ passengers on 3-engine speedboats.  Very cheap tours take over 100 people in a speedboat. 
</p><p>The higher-end tours take approx 15 to 18 passengers on 2-engine speedboats. Insist on knowing the exact number of guests that will be on the boat. Keep in mind that tour desks will tell you anything to get your money, as they receive up to 65% commissions from the lower-end tours. It is always best to contact the company running the tour directly to ensure that you are getting what you pay for. 
</p><p>The more people on the boat the longer it takes to get on and off at each stop, decreasing the time one gets to spend off the boat. A packed boat is not very fun or safe when there are large waves. 
</p><p>Private companies providing small group tours are few (currently only 3 - 1 is listed below). Full day tour prices range from 3,200 baht to 3,900 (no discounts are offered; can only be booked direct). The tours include stops at all the major sights, higher quality lunches (from picnic to seaside sit-down restaurant meals), full sets of snorkelling equipment,Kayak or canoe, minibus and miniboat transport, fresh tropical fruits, snacks &amp; drinks on-board, foreign owner/guide, small groups, attention to safety, and national park fee.

They are situated about 68km from the west coast of Phang Nga province, which is just north of Phuket. It offers just about the clearest waters in the region, ideal for snorkelling. Fishes are plenty and easily seen, though the corals are not very pretty. Similan Islands have been considered one of the top places in the world to snorkel. Book from any travel agent in Phuket (ask around - prices vary quite a bit, and avoid the big shops - they charge more. Go to a small roadside agent, who can give you lower prices). A minibus will pick you up from your hotel. The travelling time ranges from 1 to 2.5 hours for Phuket to the Phang Nga pier. Here speedboats make the 1.5 hour trip to the islands. You'll visit 3 to 4 islands, depending on the schedule and traffic. Full snorkelling gear is provided in the price. The downside is the travelling time there and back to Phuket, which can come to 7 to 8 hours in total. 
</p><p>If you're really into snorkelling, you might want to consider staying in <a href="/en/Khao_Lak" title="Khao Lak">Khao Lak</a> in Phang Nga province instead, where access to Similan Islands is easier.

<p>Phuket has some decent dive sites and is the centre of diving in Thailand. Most dive sites are off nearby islands, but distances are fairly short and there are dozens of dive shops and boats to cater to your needs, mostly based near <a href="/en/Chalong_Bay" title="Chalong Bay">Chalong Bay</a>. The reefs around the area are in a healthy condition with both solid hard corals and colorfully soft corals. There is also an abundance of marine life. Most of the dive locations are suitable for all levels of divers but there are also some that are quite deep.
</p><p>The most well-known dive site in the Phuket area is <a href="/en/Ko_Racha" title="Ko Racha">Racha Yai</a> with its sloping rocky reefs and its plenitude of solid coral forests. It is home to Ter Bay where there is an exciting wreck in the depths of 25-35 meters. The island south of Racha Yai, <a href="/en/Ko_Racha" title="Ko Racha">Racha Noi</a>, is a haven for experienced divers as the depths are greater and the currents stronger. The overall topography is strikingly different from Racha Yai with huge granite boulders. The diving in Racha Noi compared to Racha Yai is definitely more challenging but the rewards are far greater.
</p><p>Just off Phuket, is the limestone island of Ko Doc Mai that soars vertically from the sea-bed. It is home to a diversity of fish and offers the opportunity to view leopard sharks, moray eels, octopus and turtles. Phuket can also function as a base for dives further afield, such as <a href="/en/Ko_Phi_Phi" title="Ko Phi Phi">Ko Phi Phi</a>. Diving in Phuket's warm clear blue waters is best from mid-October to May, when the calm seas and rain free days make Phuket diving a truly unique experience.
</p><p>On the west coast of Phuket in front of Bangtao breach are two dive sites: Koh Waeo and Tin Lizzy. Koh Waeo is a pinnacle with plenty of marine life such as turtle, octopus, cuttlefish and moray eel. There are plenty of hard corals to find with a few spots of soft corals. Tin Lizzy an old tin dredger wreck is artificial reef with sea creatures like moray eels, pufferfish, barracuda, scorpionfish, stonefish, batfish, and lionfish. Many artificial reef blocks/cubes have been placed around the wreck and are now home to lots of marine life. 
</p><p>Thailand's top shore dive site at <a href="/en/Kata" title="Kata">Kata</a> Yai Beach is very convenient for a couple of hours scuba experience. The dive site is well known for macro marine life such as seahorses, ghost pipefish, up to 6 different species of shrimps, goby and juvenile schools of fish. The site is accessible for diving between late October to early May. Kata Yai North Reef is well know also for walk-in night dives. 
</p><p><b>Snuba diving</b> is the safest and easiest way to try diving on holiday in Phuket. Popular in Hawaii, the Carribbean, Mexico, and Japan, Snuba gives an introduction into the world of diving. No certification required, children 8+, just like scuba diving except easier. SNUBA trips go to most Phuket dive sites. No heavy equipment to wear, no long classes, maximum depth of 7 meters, professional dive guides accompany each group.

Specialist shops dealing in souvenir products can be found on Ratsada, Phang-nga, Montri, Yaowarat, and Tilok-U-thit roads, in <a href="/en/Phuket_Town" title="Phuket Town">Phuket Town</a>, Thepkasattri Road, north of town and at the beach centres of <a href="/en/Patong" title="Patong">Patong</a>, <a href="/en/Kata" title="Kata">Kata</a>, <a href="/en/Karon" title="Karon">Karon</a> and <a href="/en/Rawai" title="Rawai">Rawai</a>.
</p><p>Phuket's larger beaches are ravaged by ravenous hordes of touting <b>tailors</b>, who are certainly cheap, but will screw you over if they can. For example, suits done in 24 hours are usually just glued together and will fall apart the first time you take them to a dry cleaner.  Choose your own fabrics (you can buy them on Thalang Rd in Phuket Town), insist on multiple fittings and check the quality of work carefully.  It makes little difference which tailor shop you choose, since they're all just sales fronts for a few central sweatshops.
</p><p>There are two giant shopping malls in Phuket: <b>Central Festival</b>, at the northwest edge of <a href="/en/Phuket_Town" title="Phuket Town">Phuket Town</a>, and <b>Jungceylon</b>, in <a href="/en/Patong" title="Patong">Patong</a>.

<p>Food in Phuket is surprisingly cosmopolitan, especially in Patong, as many foreigners have set up shop to cater to their fellow travellers. All the usual Thai favourites are of course still available, with a particular emphasis on seafood. See the individual town articles for detailed listings. 
</p><p>Phuket has its own style of preparation and cooking.  Some interesting local dishes include:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Fried or boiled noodle dishes (หมี่ผัดหรือหมี่น้ำแบบต่าง ๆ)</b>, usually with pork or chicken, are available at many noodle shops in the town such as Mi Ton Pho, Mi Sapam, Mi Ao Ke, Mi Hun Pa Chang.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Khanom Jin</b> (ขนมจีน), a version of noodles eaten at breakfast, usually served with a spicy curry sauce and fresh vegetables.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Nam Phrik Kung Siap</b> (น้ำพริกกุ้งเสียบ) is a mixture of dried chilis and smoked shrimps eaten with various fresh vegetables.</li></ul>
<p>Cashew nuts and pineapples are grown in Phuket and available all year round.  The nuts are available dried, fried, or coated.  Phuket pineapples are delectable, sweet and firm.

<p>There are lots of options available in Phuket. But for the more popular hotel's and resorts in the better locations, you should book at least a couple months in advance during high season (Nov-May). Cheapest air-con room rates start at around 1,000 baht in beach locations or 500 baht away from the beach, with proper resorts starting just under 100 USD and going right up.  Best rates are usually found online by searching and many hotels offer best rate guarantees when you book direct.  Most of the time you will pay more if you walk in.  
</p><p>For long term residence, a 2-3 bedroom furnished houses available for 7000-10000 baht/month/up (only available far from the beach). But you have to pay 3 months' rent fee in advance. In addition, luxury villas can be rented at a range of prices, depending on the season and the location and size. Anywhere from 9,000-60,000 baht per night with deep discounts available for monthly or longer terms.
</p><p>With the rise of accommodation sharing websites like Airbnb, there are more options than ever before to find a vacation property. However, renting an apartment or house from a possibly untrustworthy stranger is a bit unsettling.
</p><p>Stay in the town is normally cheaper than near the beaches. Today there are several budget hotels and hostels near Phuket bus terminal 1 and around old town. You can save a lot of money to stay in the town and go to the beach by a local bus or rental motorbike.

<p>Phuket, Thailand’s Pearl of the South, is a choice many people from overseas make for medical and dental tourism as the cost is usually  much lower than in their home country for these. There are a number of decent hospitals, including JCI-accredited Bangkok Hospital Phuket and Phuket International Hospital.<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thailandmedtourism.com/Article/119/0/Nine-Reasons-to-Make-Thailand-Your-Medical-Tourism-Destination">[30]</a> These hospitals have experienced, professional medical staff, modern state-of-the-art equipment and premier services, such as international departments and translation services for visitors from many countries.
</p><p>Other major medical facilities on the island designed to cater to and care for medical tourists from overseas include Mission Hospital Phuket, Patong Hospital, and Bangkok International Clinic.  
</p><p>As far as elective procedures are concerned, such as a number of cosmetic and reconstructive procedures, Phuket has a number of  hospitals, clinics, and medical facilities which do these.

<p>The area code for Phuket is <b>076</b>. You only need to dial the 0 if you're calling from within Thailand. Pay phones are rare since most Thais have a mobile phone. Phuket has very good mobile phone coverage, albeit over slower 2G/2.5G GSM networks. Pay-as-you-go (pre-paid) SIM cards can be purchased for a few hundred baht, and local call charges range from 1 to 3 baht per minute depending on the package.
</p><p>If you arrive by air, the easiest way to buy a local pre-paid (pay-as-you-go) SIM card is to go to the <i>True Move</i> booth in the airport. They will give you a free, pre-paid SIM card, with a booklet instructing you how to activate and use it. Calling voice is much cheaper than sending an SMS. You can top up the card at any 7-Eleven or convenience store. 
</p><p>Mobile Internet is available from all providers, with <i>True Move</i> offering 3G access from a limited network of base stations on the eastern coast, including Patong, Kata and Karon. All other networks offer EDGE and/or GPRS access, so don't expect fast Internet connections on your mobile device. For e-mail and basic surfing GPRS speeds are normally fine, but access to websites hosted outside Thailand can be slow. 
</p><p>Unlike many western countries, Thai networks bill mobile internet usage by duration rather than bandwidth, with PAYG users paying around 1 baht per minute.  Most networks have PAYG monthly unlimited GPRS deals for around 750 baht, and you can easily purchase a SIM and the Internet package at one of the numerous phone shops around Phuket.
</p><p>If you don't have a pressing need to use the Internet everywhere, wait till you're back at your accommodation and then use their Wi-Fi. This saves you money because you don't have to buy an internet SIM package.

<p>Particularly in the summer monsoon season, there are <b>strong currents</b> on many of the beaches and drownings are a depressingly common occurrence. Heed the warning flags on popular beaches and play it safe if off the beaten track.
</p><p>Crime as of late has definitely increased in the Phuket area among tourists and you should keep this in mind and be vigilant of anyone who wants to befriend you or trick you into gambling (which is illegal) and anything else you consider out of the ordinary. Katoeys (ladyboys) are notorious for pick pocketing as you walk around the tourist areas at night. Also muggings do take place regularly. Avoid walking down unlit sois; stick to the main roads. If something looks/sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
</p><p>Tourist Police can be contacted locally by dialling <i><b>1155</b></i>. They have a good basic understanding of English, so if in trouble these people should be contacted. Thai police speak hardly any English and normally take the side of the locals even if it is their fault. Always insist on the Tourist Police if you have any run-in with the Thai police. Use only metered taxis and ask hotels to call, take down driver licence plate and taxi registration numbers before you board. You can use the receipt from taxis to complain to police or find lost property, so take a receipt and licence numbers.
</p><p>Scams are, unfortunately, rife as the downturn in trade recently has forced some locals to desperate measures. Try to not to engage with any Thai person who approaches you in the street speaking English, use your common sense, and be extremely careful if renting a motor vehicle or jet ski. If they claim that you have damaged the vehicle and demand $2000 from you, there is little that you can do unless you took careful photos beforehand. Also, never hand over your passport as a deposit, once the vendor has it you are over a barrel. Don't invite people back to your room that you don't know, sure 90% of the time you will be fine but it only takes one time for a person to slip something in your drink and run off with all of your belongings. Most hotels demand ID for additional guests but Thai people know this and can easily get fake IDs produced leaving you high and dry if anything goes wrong.
</p><p>In addition, take care because bill padding takes place in many places and they will deliberately write the bill in Thai hoping that you don't understand it. Keep track of how much you are spending and don't be scared to ask for the bill in English if you suspect something fishy is going on. Also, and this is especially important in poorly lit bars and clubs, always try and pay with small bills. It is very common to pay with a thousand baht bill and get back 500 baht less change than you expected, and they will be adamant that you paid with a 500. In this situation there is practically nothing you can do, it's your word against the restaurants and you will always lose. A lot of bars and restaurants are struggling financially with the decline of the tourism industry on Phuket and unfortunately this means that this kind of unscrupulous behavior has become more and more common. There are loads of places to exchange your bills, and 7-Elevens are everywhere for you to buy a bottle of water and ask for the change in 100 baht notes.

<p>Tap water is generally not potable. Liquids from sealed bottles nearly always are, and should be used wherever possible. Take care in restaurants and bars. Some may use untreated/unsafe tap water to make ice for drinks that otherwise have bottled/safe ingredients. Some residents claim that ice with round holes is made by commercial ice makers who purify their water; others state that it is wise not to rely on that claim. Tap water in most hotels should not be used for drinking unless explicitly labelled as safe.

<p>Unfortunately this beautiful island is home to some less than dubious touristic attractions that often rely on animal exploitation. You can help avoid endorsing such places, shows, or so called “conservation” projects ("Help us to help them!"), as even most of the latter are little more than just touristic attractions with little or no real intention of actually helping to release or even protect these animals. If you are considering volunteer positions or day tours with elephants, thoroughly do your research before making any commitments.
At some bars and touristic spots some people may offer you to take your photograph with animals, even baby animals, in exchange for money. Please remember that the most likely way (and many times the only way) these babies were acquired were by poachers killing the mothers, or the entire family. Endorsing this practice only leads to more demand, and more killing. Moreover, some of the species used are endangered and protected under Thai law, which makes the possession and abuse of many of these animals illegal.
</p><p>The Gibbon Rehabilitation Project is a sanctuary for former photo prop and pet gibbons, and has been working hard for the last decade to rehabilitate and reintroduce them into the wild, in the National Park by Bang Pae Waterfall, should you be interested in learning loads of information about these issues, you may visit their Education Centre inside the park.
