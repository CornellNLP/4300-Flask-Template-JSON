<p>Most of tourist Yerevan is concentrated in the centre. The centre is very compact and easily walkable, with endless dining and entertainment options. The rest of the city is mostly sleeping or business quarters, so a typical tourist will not have much incentive to leave the centre. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Kentron</b>, <b>Centre City</b> or <b>Downtown</b> - is central Yerevan, locally called as <i>kentron</i> ("Kentron" is the romanized way of writing the Greek word "κέντρον" which means "centre") or just <i>kaghak</i> (meaning 'the city').  This is the heart of Yerevan and indeed Armenia. Though Kentron's architecture is diverse, ranging from Belle Epoque to Soviet Panel blocks, the great majority of the centre is in Beaux-Arts tradition. Downtown Yerevan follows Tamanyan's plan for a circular city with two hubs - grand Republic Square, and the more elegant and soft Opera district (Opera house, Freedom Square and the Swan Lake Park). The two are linked with newly-constructed pedestrian-only Northern Avenue. The Main Avenue (standard South European Corso) is still under construction (for the last 60 years, although on a greater scale during the last couple of years) and will eventually reach the hill on which the historical Kond district rests. Kentron is also home to the University City, where the campuses of State University, Medical University, Engineering University, Agricultural University, Economics University, Pedagogical and some other universities come together in one big group. Virtually all of the museums, hotels and popular places to eat and drink are in Kentron, so most visitors will probably not venture much past it.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Barekamutyun</b> - Meaning friendship, Barekamutyun is the area around the metro stop of the same name. The neighboring district is Arabkir, which is considered small downtown (Pokr Kendron).This hub is home to the Hayastan Hanrakhanut department store (which is more of an indoor bazaar than an actual department store). The hub branches off to Kievyan and nearby Komitas streets.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Monument</b> - At the top of the Cascade steps rests the towering monument to Soviet victory in WW2.  Directly adjacent is the large construction site of the Cafesjian Museum, which houses a large collection of contemporary art, including perhaps the best glass art collection in the world.  Beyond the monument is Victory Park, and the district around it is known as Monument as well.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Erebuni</b> - In this district is situated the ruins of the fortress of Erebuni, founded in 782BC by king Argishti. The famous Statue of Sasuntsi David (David of Sasun) is located in front of the grand classical Soviet train station of Yerevan, right by a metro station of the same name. Lyon Park, popularly known as Tokhmakh park is down the street from the train station. With a big lake, nice lawns and playground, this historic water hole is a great spot for recreation or a picnic. In the vicinity is a natural salt bath that is raw (meaning open to all without management). It is popular with locals.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bangladesh</b> - Not to be confused with country in Asia! Not much to offer a tourist, the name however is worth an explanation.  At the time this was one of the furthest new districts built in Yerevan, and because of the distance, locals quickly began calling it Bangladesh, which has stuck to this day. The biggest outdoor bazaar of Yerevan is located in this district.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Nor Nork</b> district is the last Soviet project of residential expansion of Yerevan. It entirely consists of standardised Soviet Panel blocs. However, every tourist crosses this district on the way to 'obligatory' Garni temple and Geghard monastery (as the highway to that direction is connected to the main avenue of this district). The main attraction of this district would be the Gay Statue, though the name has nothing to do with homosexuality (to avoid this interesting misunderstanding most often the name of the avenue and statue is Romanised as Guy). Even though people call it Gai ardzan, it is the statue of Hayk Bzhshkyants (Հայկ Բժշկյանց). to meet someone, it is enough to say "Gayi Ardzan" and people will know. Unfortunately not everyone knows about Hayk himself. He was a member of people's volunteer corps (Kamavorakan), and participated in fights near Mush and Erzrum in Western Armenia. It's just the Russians gave him such nickname since there is no sound H in Russian. By the way, it is the tallest statue in the world among the ones that have the horse standing on their back two legs. It's height is 12.5 meters and it weighs 30 tons and was erected in 1978.</li></ul>

<p>Even though the history of Yerevan dates back to the Erebuni fortress, making it at least 2800 years old, little remains of what was  small settlement saving the excavations at Hrazdan river gorge, Erebuni, Karmir Berd and Avan.  These sites have been excavated, and the artefacts found are in museums today. Being on a strategically important place Yerevan was a constant war stage for rival Ottoman, Persian and Russian Empires. It has been repeatedly ruined by those wars or natural disasters (e.g. an earthquake in 17th century almost entirely destroyed the town). Few buildings of the old Erivan survived to the present-day Yerevan.
</p><p>At the time of Armenia's independence in 1918, when Yerevan was made the capital of an independent Armenia, Yerevan was a town of just 20,000.  Large scale construction began, which took a more holistic approach under the new city plan laid out by Alexander Tamanyan.  The plan involved the demolition of much of what existed, in favour of concentric circles, parks, and taller structures. He planned for Yerevan to become a metropolis of 200,000 people.

<p>Yerevan is a very homogeneous city, though tiny Yezidi and Molokan (Russian) minorities exist. Because the population of the city was only 20,000 a century ago, the vast majority of the Armenians are immigrants themselves, from all over the world.  From the villages and towns of Armenia, from Tbilisi which was the centre of Eastern Armenian culture before 1918, from Western Armenia as genocide survivors poured in, and even from the Middle East and Europe in a large, post-WWII wave of immigration.  Since independence, the city has become the heart of the entire Armenian world, as the divisive communist governments demise has allowed the Diaspora – larger in number than the population of Armenia itself, to embrace the city as its own.

<p>Many visitors will be surprised to know that Armenia is not just an outcrop of Christianity in the <a href="/en/Caucasus" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, but was the first country in the world to adopt Christianity as a state religion. The king declared Christianity the state religion in 301AD. Christianity has been uninterruptedly practised in Armenia ever since in its own traditions. 
</p><p>The <b>One Holy Catholic Apostolic Orthodox Armenian Church</b>, or just <i>Apostolic Church</i>, is the National Church of Armenia. It is very traditional; in practices (but not history) is similar to both Orthodox and Catholic movements as well as to the Reformed Churches, e.g. the Church of England. At the same time the Armenian Apostolic Church has some strikingly different practices, like allowing animal sacrifices or celebrating Christmas on 6 January. 
</p><p>The great majority of Armenians identify themselves as Apostolic Christians and have their own <i>Catholicos</i> (religious leader, like the Pope for Catholics). Today, the vast majority of Armenians do not attend church each Sunday, with visits revolving around weddings and baptisms, or occasionally dropping in to light a candle. Soviet restructuring of the city left Yerevan with very few churches: Currently some new ones are being built, and old ones rehabilitated.
</p><p>The <i>Protestant (Evangelical) Armenians</i> are rather few in number with only one church on Baghramyan street (Ex American Embassy bld). <i>Anglican (Episcopal)</i> Christians congregate at St Zoravor church for Sunday Eucharist. In April 2013 a new Anglican Chaplain, Fr John Barker, arrived in Yerevan and services of Holy Communion in English take place every Sunday at 18:30.
</p><p><i>Orthodox Christians</i> currently maintain one church in Kanaker district of Yerevan. A new, large-scale, onion-domed Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Cross is under construction at Yerevan Lake district, visible from the highway coming from the airport. However, this will have mostly symbolic structure as the Orthodox Christians are very few in number.
</p><p><i>Assyrians</i> do not have a church in Yerevan, but rather in the villages around Yerevan.
</p><p><i>Yezidi</i> (pagan religious and ethnic minority in Armenia) religious rituals, as most of that religion, are kept secret. So no Yezidian practice can be observed easily in Yerevan.
</p><p><i>Muslims</i> are steadily growing in numbers since the collapse of the Soviet State, fuelled by Iranian immigration. There is currently one Mosque on Mashtots Ave.
</p><p>Many Christian independent churches are also present in Yerevan, and they congregate in schools, sport clubs, concert halls and the like.

<p>With a continental climate, Yerevan experiences long hot summers, and cold winters, both with little or no humidity. Spring offers mild but sometimes wet weather, and lots of green hills and wildflowers. Summer is very hot, but the long, late nights at the cafes, and the fruits and vegetables are amazing. Fall is the most popular, with perfect weather, and great farm fresh foods.

<p>Armenia, similar to some other post-soviet countries, faces serious problems relating with smoking culture, lack of law regulations protecting non-smokers and poor law enforcement. The country has one of the highest rates of smoking in the world, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/Prevalence-of-tobacco-smoking-in-Armenia-STEPs-survey,94872,0,2.html">every second men</a> is a regular smoker. Due to very low level of awareness of smoking-associated health risks it's very hard to avoid cigarette smoke in public places, restaurants and even when using public transport. To avoid the smoke, visit strictly non-smoking cafe or restaurant, you will find them in <b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://non-smoking-armenia.com/">Map of Non-smoking Places in Armenia</a></b>. For example Art Lunch, Yum-Yum Donuts, Cinnabon, The Green Bean Cafe are strictly non-smoking. Let your taxi or bus driver know it is not okay to smoke, they usually respect passengers.

<ul><li><b>Airport shuttle bus</b> no. 201 runs between the city centre and the airport from 7:00 am until 9:30 pm. Bus stop is located few meters from the entrance to the airport building. City centre bus stop is in Yeritasardakan at an entrance to Metronome shopping mall on the corner of Isahakyan and Abovyan Street. The fare is 300 Drams.

<ul><li>A <b>taxi ride</b> from the airport to the city will cost from AMD4,200 (USD10) to the centre, and up to AMD6,700 (USD16) for the most distant parts of the city.  Some drivers may try to convince you to pay more, but don’t ever believe them, and telling them you will call the police (who will help you) should straighten out any opportunists. Almost 100%  of taxis are using a taxi meter (<i>sheochik</i>), so, the best if you have local currency with you to pay for the trip.</li></ul>
<p>You may want to use taxis that are the official transport of Zvartnots Airport - <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.aerotaxi.am"><b>AeroTaxi</b></a> so that in case of losing your baggage, you always know where to find it.

<p>An overnight (sleeper)train runs every second day<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ukzhd.am/batumi2014/eng/schedule.html">[1]</a> from <a href="/en/Tbilisi" title="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a> in <a href="/en/Georgia_(country)" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>. After departing at 22:15  the journey takes nine hours with a scheduled arrival time in Yerevan of 07:18. Border formalities will be at 23:00, expect it to take some time. The wagons are the standard Soviet era hold-overs but they are fairly comfortable. Bring your own food and water as there is no restaurant car onboard. Fares start at 31 laris per bed (includes sheets, pillow and towel). Make sure you get a ticket early on the day you travel as the lower bunks sell out fast.
</p><p>Overnight trains in the winter depart at 20:20 or 22:00, you should check at the station which time is valid for any day. The journey takes approximately 11 hours. The cheapest seating place in "obschij vagon" is 22 lari, but you may find yourself being seated among hundreds of boxes of mandarins and other fruits, since this is one of the ways of moving goods to Armenia. Perhaps this information is outdated. Check at the railway station.

<p>You can reach Yerevan by bus from Tbilisi, fare costs 15 lari ($10US) and takes about 12 hours. More expensive is to take a 30 lari ($20 US) marshutka/minibus but it’s much faster at about 5 hours. Sometimes you can take a shared car from Tbilisi as well.  Again, a bit more expensive than minibus, but faster and more comfortable.
</p><p>Bus service to Yerevan also is available in <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, or many of the cities on the Black Sea coast of Turkey en route to Yerevan, with a detour through Georgia. 
</p><p>There is also a daily service to/from Tehran and Tabriz. Buy ticket at Kilikia bus station, 25000 dram (55USD) the same for Tabriz and Tehran. 
Ticket office with old lady (probably speaks no English) works till 17:00. Bring passport with you. 
Departure around 12:00. 
The bus is extremely comfortable, a small bag of snacks and water is provided, it stops at least once each side of the border and the scenery is incredible, however it does take about 22 hours. The border crossing is, of course, an absolute nightmare beyond imagination. (November 2015 was very easy, but took 2.5 hours in total)
</p><p>After you clear Iranian border you can change money. Rate is good  (34900 IRR/USD, November 2015). Almost the same as in Tehran.

<p>The center of Yerevan is very compact and easy to get around by foot. Be aware, that there are recently introduced penalties for jaywalking and crossing the streets in non-designated areas, and once spotted by police, you will have to pay a fine of AMD 3000 ($9). A nice walk if you like nature and not cars, is through the Hrazdan gorge on the margins of the city center.

<p>The Subway system in Yerevan (people call it metro) is quite reliable and relatively modern, having been built in the early 1980s. It is the quickest way around town, and at 100 dram (less than US$0.30), the cheapest aside from walking. Plastic coins needed to enter (but not to exit) the system can be purchased at each station's manned booth.

<p>Today the metro operates as a single line, with a shuttle branch and covers 12km (7.5 miles), with trains running every five minutes from 6:30 a.m. till 11 p.m. Due to Yerevan's uneven landscape, the metro in some cases goes above ground. Continuing the tradition of all ex-Soviet underground systems, most of the stations are exquisitely decorated, often blending Armenian national motifs with late-Soviet architecture.

<p>More than a hundred minibus (marshrutka, pronounced mar-shroot-kah) routes exist that criss-cross the city and travel to the suburbs and beyond (such as to Georgia or Karabagh). At 100 dram (US$0.33) a ride in Yerevan, they are a bargain. The minibuses are often overcrowded, and you may find yourself standing, crouched without a seat during rush hour.  The route number is displayed prominently in the window, along with Armenian text listing the major landmarks and streets of the route.  The Opera (ՕՊԵՐԱ) is an easy Armenian word to recognize on these signs, and is the main crossing point of many of the lines.  When you want to get off, you should say “kangnek” or “ijnokh ka” for the driver to hear, or else, just say “stop” in English. The numbers of the minibuses are written on the bus stations though and the webpage of the tourist information has the whole list with destinations. Pay when leaving a minibus.

<p>Yerevan has lots of  buses and a few trolley lines , operated by "Yergortrans." The fare is very inexpensive (100 dram for busses, nearly $0.25 and 50 dram for trolleys ) and the vehicles are not too crowded. Pay when leaving a bus or trolley.
</p><p>Buses and minivans are the major means of transportation within the country. From Yerevan you can get to literally every place in Armenia within a day. To make things confusing for foreigners, there are several different regional bus-stations in Yerevan and the minivans tend to leave from hard to find places just somewhere at the side of the road. When heading into Yerevan, they are not unknown to drop you at random spots somewhere in the city, so ask the driver beforehand to drop you at a convenient place.

<p>This bus station lies around 5km north of the city center on the Yerevan-<a href="/en/Sevan" title="Sevan">Sevan</a> Highway.

<p>Trains are cheap but inconvenient and uncomfortable options, but for the adventurous they can be taken on the Yerevan - Lake Sevan, Yerevan - Gyumri, Vanadzor - Alaverdi - Yevlakh routes. The overnight sleeper train that runs between Tbilisi and Yerevan is fine.

<p>Abundant throughout the city, a taxi ride anywhere downtown should not cost more than 1000 dram (US$3). Almost all taxis with company names on the sides have meters, and prices tend to be competitive among taxi companies. To flag an empty one down on the street, just hold your arm out and pat your hand in the air, if they’re free they’ll stop.  Taxis without a logo on the side tend to charge more, and may to try to get more out of foreigners. To avoid being ripped off, either call a taxi from a big company or head for the most modern looking ones which usually have a meter. Make sure that the driver switches it on when you start and politely remind him to do so if he has "forgotten" it. If taxi has meter and the driver hasn't turned it on, in most cases passenger can not pay for the trip. Carry some coins to prevent the drivers from telling you that they have no change on them. Standard price is a minimum of 500-600 Dram for the first 5 km and than 100 Dram for every further km.  A car and driver can easily be rented for day trip outside of Yerevan, for as little as $20 plus gas.
Beware of moonlighting "taxi" drivers at the airport who will try to charge you ridiculous amounts (20,000 dram or more) to get to the city. Finally never ever believe any taxidriver who wants to convince you that there is no bus or minivan to the destination you are heading to.
</p><p>Download apps such as GG or Yandex (both similar to uber), makes getting around very easy and cheap for tourists. GG works in many parts of Armenia.

<ul><li><b>Republic Square</b> - Make sure to see the main square. Though it never took the planed shape of the Grand Square of a perfect city of Tamanyan, it still can be considered the finest example of Soviet era architecture as far as squares go. The early buildings (the Houses of Government, the Ministry of Communications, and the Marriott Hotel) are fine example of Neo-Classical architecture with Armenian hints. The buildings from later period (the Foreign Ministry, and Art Gallery) are Modernist imitations of previous ones.</li>
<li><b>Northern Avenue</b> - impossible to miss, this pedestrian avenue was just opened in 2008 connecting Opera with Republic Square, the two hubs of central Yerevan. It's a Post-Modern response to post-WWII Soviet Yerevan architecture. It is emerging as the shopping district, together with Sayat-Nova ave., Terian st., Tumanian st., and Abovian st.</li></ul>

Most often they are in a very poor condition due to neglect. Hanrapetutian st. might get a special attention if you are not time constrained.</li>
<li><b>The Opera</b> – It's the 'soft' center of the city. It is topped by the magnificent building of the Opera House. The building is perhaps modeled after SemperOper of Dresden, however it is supposed to be double as beautiful as the Yerevan building is two sided: One side (entrance from the Theatrical/Freedom square) is home to Opera and Ballet Theatre, while the street side houses the Khachaturian Concert Hall.</li>
<li><b>Freedom (or Theatrical) Square</b> is part of The Opera. North side of the square is the Opera House, followed by a park full of open air cafés on the West, from South it borders the Northern Avenue, and on the East the square slowly transforms into park with Swan Lake. The Swan Lake park ends with the controversial statue of the composer Arno Babajanyan, which already was majorly reshaped twice during the first year of its placement. The Swan Lake park usually hosts various open air art exhibitions.</li>

The main part of the museum is in the Cascades - an Art Deco version of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon stretching nearly the height of the Empire State Building. It's a massive white stairway up a hillside of central Yerevan, decorated with green stretches, fountains and waterfalls.

It is overly noisy because of the heavy traffic (mostly unorganised public transportation) but the parts close to The Opera is a favourite hangout place for the locals. There are 3 buildings on the avenue which are well worth attention - Matenadaran, and the Blue Mosque.</li>
<li><b>Matenadaran</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://matenadaran.am/">[3]</a>– Houses the worlds largest collection of Armenian illuminated manuscripts, and one of the largest such collections of any kind in the world.  A display room has a sampling of some of the finest works, and the additional cost of the guided tour is worthwhile. The building is dug into the hill and can withstand a nuclear attack.</li>
<li><b>Blue Mosque</b> - is a reconstructed 18th century Shia Islamic Mosque, one of the extreme few surviving structures of once (before Soviet secularisation) prospering Muslim Community of Yerevan. If you are fortunate, you will be approached by an ethnic Armenian refugee from the Iranian revolution who will describe the mosque in context for a small fee.</li>
<li><b>Covered Market</b> - It's an original building, a combination of Jungenstil and Beaux-Arts. It still houses a market of fresh, sun-dried and conserved produce. A few years ago, the covered market was turned into a huge supermarket. For a more authentic experience, visit the Gum market.</li>
<li><b>Main Railway Station</b> is a Neo-classical building, small scale version of Soviet skyscrapers such as Moscow State University or Warsaw Culture Palace, with a red-star-topped high spire serving as a symmetry axis. The Railway Station building dominates the David of Sassoun Square which has the statue of David of Sasoun (hero of the Armenian epic tale) as a centerpiece. The statue itself is worth seeing (some would claim more than the building): It is the masterpiece of Kochar - the mastermind of Cubism driven Dimentionalism movement in Armenia - a very dynamic Equestrian statue. The metro stop 'Sasuntsi David' opens into the square. Unfortunately, the square, the building and the statue are in a measly condition now, as the blockade-driven underusage of the railway left the place unattended.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Victory Park/Monument</b> - Amusement park. Features a huge monument of Mother Armenia as well as some Soviet military equipment on display. Very nice view of the city center.</li>
<li><b>Lover's Park</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bg.am/">[4]</a> - the oldest park of Yerevan. Recently renovated in tradition of Japanese landscaping with Armenian spirit. It often hosts open air art exhibitions and concerts. It is best reachable by metro, station 'Marshal Baghramian' - perhaps the most underused building and allegedly the best in Modernist style.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Children's Park</b> - This is yet another beautiful remnant of Soviet urban planning in Yerevan. The park, opened in 1937, is situated in a gorgeous canyon of Hrazdan river and features a Children's railway. The park was renovated in 2012, so the "ghost park atmosphere is not that present anymore. In order to find it you will need a direction from a local.</li>
<li><b>The Singing Fountains</b> - From early Spring to late Autumn each evening there is a fountain and light show in front of the Art Gallery at the Republic square. The program includes some classical favorites, as well as contemporary Jazz, Rock and Pop (US or Russian). Usually it spans from 10pm to 11pm. It is free of charge.</li>
<li><b>Khachkar Park</b> - located 3-minute walk away from the Republic Square, next to the Republic Square metro station, this park features replicas of famous Armenian khachkars, a form of Armenian medieval art.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Parajanov Museum</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://parajanovmuseum.am/">[5]</a> - The House-Museum of Sergei Parajanov, a famous Soviet film director. The museum is best known for special Parajanov collages and his bizarre art. It is comprised of found pieces of material, household objects, and other doodads. Many high level official informal meetings are conducted here. The entrance is 1000dram and the guided tours are offered for about 8 euro.</li>
<li><b>Saryan Museum</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://saryan.am/eng/">[6]</a> If you are a lover of bright colours and enjoy Expressionist Art then House Museum of Martiros Saryan is a place for you. It's a 3 floor structure, built during the lifetime of the artist, as his house and house for his heritage after his life. So most of the Museum is designed by the artist himself. Address: Saryan 3, EVN002.</li>
<li><b>Cafesjian Museum of Modern Art</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://cmf.am/">[7]</a> is a museum of modern art, house to the collection of Gerard Cafesjian. It has Arshile Gorky, Andy Warhol, Marc Chagall and other big names on display. The collection is very rich in Glass Art, has many pieces of Libenský-Brychtová couple, including special-made "For Armenia" series. A separate floor is devoted to Swarovski Chandelier collection. The inside elevator is opened 8-20, the exhibition halls are opened until 5pm on weekdays and until 8 on weekends.</li>
<li><b>The National Art Gallery</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://gallery.am">[8]</a> - Located at Republic Square in the same building as the National History Museum. Features several floors full of mostly paintings, organized by their country of origin.  The Armenian collection is the best and of very high quality, the Russian is quite good (Kandinsky, Serov, Chagall), and art lovers will enjoy the European collection as well.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://genocide-museum.am/eng/permanent_exhibition.php"><b>The Armenian Genocide Memorial</b></a> (<i>Genocide Museum &amp; Tsitsernakaberd Monument</i>) is on a hill above the city centre. A very austere monument dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide and well worth seeing. Tsitsernakaberd (meaning "Fortress of swallows") is probably best reached by taxi. Genocide Museum is home to French artist Jean Jansem's startling collection of paintings named <i>Génocide</i>.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://yerevanhistorymuseum.info.am"><b>The City Museum of Yerevan</b></a> presents all periods of the life in Yerevan starting from the palaeolithic settlements of 50,000 years ago to modern times. Ancient maps and pictures of the lost city -  pre-Soviet Erivan - are of special interest.</li>
<li><b>Museum of Woodwork</b> houses some artefacts of Armenian historical wood carving culture (doors, furniture and the like) as well as wood-based sculptures of modern day artists. Situated at the address Paronyan 2 (at a ring border of downtown).</li></ul>

<p>Churches in Yerevan are open from early morning till very late evening. There is no entrance fee ever charged. If you manage to find the priest you can ask him to bless you and any object (of non-violent usage) that belongs to you (including friendship and other relationships).
</p>
<ul><li><b>Katoghike</b> is the oldest surviving church of Yerevan. It is a tiny structure constructed in typical Armenian style. Currently, the area of Katoghike (also named St Holy Mother of God) church is under construction: It is planed that a white stone based St Anne Monastery will be built, of which Katoghike church will be only a minor part. On the crossroads of Sayat-Nova ave. and Abovian st.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>St Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral</b> was completed in 2001 to commemorate the 1700th anniversary of Armenia as a Christian nation. The holy relics of St Gregory the Armenian were given back to the Armenian Church by the Vatican in 2001 and placed in this cathedral. The building is a megalomaniac exaggeration of traditional Armenian Church Architecture. As opposed to all other churches in Yerevan (and Armenia) the Cathedral is full of light and does not carry any stand for candles. The candle-house is a separate structure next door. However, the complex is vastly and visibly unfinished. Not far from the Republic Square (visible from there).</li>
<li><b>St Sargis Vicarial Church</b> is at the border of the city centre, on a picturesque gorge of Hrazdan River. From the Victory Bridge (or alternatively the Brandy Factory building) there is a beautiful view on the church and surroundings (structures of different shades constructed in immediate proximity to the church during the Soviet years of forced secularisation). The church is always crowded. Usually there are also many young people as St Sargis (or St Sergius in Western churches) is the patron saint of young people and of lovers.</li>
<li><b>St Astvatsatsin of Nork</b> is the replica of a beautiful 18th century St Holy Mother of God (Sb Astvatsatsin in Armenian) church destroyed during the Soviet years of forced secularisation. Because of the sudden death of the benefactor the church complex was never finished. The most convenient way for reaching the church is using Yerevan funicular. The funicular itself is a special experience. However the church is not immediately next to the funicular stop so you may need some help of the locals at the end. The entrance to funicular is at the crossroad of Nalbandian and Charents streets. The church is in the Nork district of Yerevan - the sleeping quarter of rich.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Armenian brandy</b> (locally called Cognac as well) is considered one of the world's finest brandies and is accordingly a popular gift to take home for tourists. It was Winston Churchill's brandy of choice. There are many shops within central Yerevan centre devoted solely to brandy from the Ararat Cognac Factory; the airport is also a good place to stock up at duty free. As a rule, the more aged the brandy, the more refined the taste and the more expensive.</li>
<li>Armenian rugs, new and old are a favourite choice. New carpets can be purchased at the Mergeryan Rug Factory for a good price. More upmarket is the international brand “Tufenkian Carpets”, with a shop on Tumanyan near Abovyan. Both will add your name or inscription request into an existing rug, or do a custom rug for you. There is no problem with exporting these. Old rugs are found in shops all over town, or in Vernissage. Be sure the seller obtains an export certificate from the ministry of culture for you – or you’re taking a chance that it may be confiscated. Negotiate to have the certificate delivered to you as part of the purchase price, and buy your rug a week before you go to give them time to obtain this certificate. New rugs do not require certification, but keep your factory certificate as proof that it is new.</li>
<li>More fragile, but maybe worth the effort are some of the more exotic jams and preserves made in Armenia. From walnut preserves, to “Sea Buckthorne” (Chichkhan), virtually everything that grows in Armenia is canned.</li>
<li><b>Armenian Vodka</b> is made out of fruit (mainly peach or apricot) and is a typical Armenian brevage. The bottle is recognisable as it has a fruit drawn on it. It's branded АРЦАХ (in Russian), ԱՐՑԱԽ (in Armenian) or Artsakh in latin Armenian characters.</li>
<li>Cigarettes are cheap, but you better buy them before you go to the airport, as they are more than twice more expensive when bought at the duty free.</li></ul>

<p>The <i>dram</i> (<b>AMD</b>) is the national currency of Armenia.
</p><p>As of August 17, 2018:
</p>
<ul><li>EUR1 = AMD546</li>
<li>GBP1 = AMD608</li>
<li>USD1 = AMD482</li></ul>
<p>Rates vary widely.
</p><p>When arriving in Zvartnots International Airport exchange only small amounts for taxi or airport service as the exchange rate at the airport is always poor. Exchanges can be found all over the city, and do not charge a commission – count your money on the spot, though they tend to be patently honest. Banks tend to be the least convenient place to exchange, and tend to have the worst rates – exchange on the streets. Exchange rates on the streets are almost all quite competitive, so shopping around is only worthwhile for very large amounts. Shops and restaurants will frequently accept dollars in a pinch, though they prefer dram. 
</p><p>Cash (in dram only) can be withdrawn from numerous ATMs located in the city, but you may have to try several machines before getting money. Try local banks (like Ararat). HSBC ATMs usually refuse to recognise non-Armenian cards. Though Visa and Master Card are accepted in many restaurants, supermarkets and shops in Yerevan, carry some cash. To withdraw dollars from your credit card, you can go into a bank.

<p>Stands selling Armenian-style "pizzas" called "lamehjun" or "lahmajoun" are prevalent throughout Yerevan. This cheap snack consists of a thin layer of dough topped with an herb and meat paste. Another option if you like fresh vegetables and lean meat is to use buffets in supermarkets and shops. Many locals buy lunch and dinner at these places. Good value for money and though dishes are cold, food that is served in restaurants often is cold as well. Expect to pay 1200 to 1500 Dram for a vegetable salad of your choice, a piece of meat and fried potatoes or buckwheat.

<ul><li><b>Anteb</b> a family-run joint that serves a huge variety of kebabs in a very casual cafe-type setting.

<p>Armenia itself is a place to drink, with no prohibition against drinking in public. Cafés, bars, restaurants, clubs and the countryside on a picnic are all popular places for vodka, the usual drink of choice, with wine, beer, champagne and brandy all popular as well. You can even drink in a car – as long as you’re not driving. Drivers cannot have a drop of alcohol in them, with Zero being the legal threshold – and the penalties for violating this are stiff.
</p><p>Drink water. Yerevan has numerous small fountains with crystal clear drinking water of the kind that Western entrepreneurs put in bottles and sell.

<ul><li>Cognac – see the buy section above.</li>
<li>Homemade fruit vodkas – these are not flavoured from fruit like most of the western vodkas, they are actually made from pure fruit. The most popular is the Tutti Oghi (Mulberry Vodka), but just as impressive if you can find them are the Cornelian Cherry (Hon), Pear, Apricot and Peach.</li>
<li>Wine – Areni grapes are only grown in Armenia, which is in the oldest grape and wine producing part of the world. Old Yerevan is the best brand.</li>
<li>Compote – if you can get it, this usually home made fruit juice is fantastic. Ask locals, and if some of them have it at home, they will drag you in to try.</li>
<li>Tan – blended plain yoghurt with water and a dash of salt, this drink is often an acquired taste, and very refreshing. It’s a healthy alternative to soda, so give it a try.  You can sometimes find bottled fizzy tan, which is an even more acquired taste!</li></ul>

<p>Yerevan has a wide variety of accommodations but for the most part they are overpriced.  If you're staying for an extended period of time, <b>rent an apartment.</b> 
</p><p><br />
</p><p>It's almost impossible to sleep cheaply in a hotel in Yerevan. Try home stays with Armenian families that rent out rooms. There are many of these places and they cost from USD8-12 per night per person. Many are located in the centre of Yerevan and if you can handle not having your own “space” they are a wonderful way to truly see Armenian hospitality up close. You can get a list of these home stays by contacting the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://armeniainfo.am">Armenian Tourism Development Agency (ATDA)</a>.

<p>Yerevan is generally safer than many western-European cities. Crime and street violence is almost non-existent here. Nevertheless, as in the most cities of its size, in crowded places and transport beware of pickpockets.  
</p><p>The traffic can be quite rough, so pay close attention when crossing the street, especially in non designated area. There are about 3000 Dram (9 USD) fine for jaywalking.
</p><p><i>Be Informed</i>
There is an additional 10-15% charge on almost all restaurants for service. So, tipping isn't mandatory in Armenia and it is already included in the final price of the receipt.
</p><p>Some night clubs have entrance fee. When entering a night club ask if they charge an entrance fee. Specifically Palazzo di Lusso on Nothern Avenue has a bad reputation. Upon entry, you will be warmly welcomed and probably have a great time. At then end of the evening however, a ridiculous amount of money (e.g. 5000 Dram per person) is added to the bill as 'entrance fee'. When you mention that this was not clear beforehand or displayed anywhere at the entrance / inside the club, their friendliness changes. Uniformed (Police-look-a-like) men enter the bar and behave very aggressive, saying that you have to pay now or will end up in jail. Pay attention at bars / clubs that are (almost) empty, for example during the week or in low season and when going out with foreigners only.

<p>There are three GSM service providers operating in Armenia. It is strongly advised to acquire a temporary prepaid SIM card as they are cheap and convenient, allowing both local and international calls, no charge for incoming calls and no monthly fee. Mobile internet and UMTS are also offered from all companies, as well as the normal full range of wireless services. 
</p><p>Viva-MTS and Ucom have booths offering free SIM-Cards to incoming visitors at the airport. They are also easiest to top-up (at pretty much any store or kiosk in the country!) and have better English service, rates and coverage. 
Majority of foreign visitors find their unlocked mobile phones compatible with Armenian SIM cards (GSM 900/1800). GSM coverage maps of Armenia: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://gsmworld.com/roaming/gsminfo/cou_am.shtml">[31]</a>.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Viva-MTS</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://mts.am/">[32]</a> (formerly known as VivaCell-MTS and sometimes called that) is the leading GSM service provider in Armenia and offers quality service at reasonable rates (owned by the Russian giant MTS). They have the best coverage outside of Yerevan. At their flagship store off of Republic Square, Viva-MTS is very helpful to foreigners and will make sure that you understand everything in English, French or Russian. They offer very low prices for international calls from your phone via a VoIP (be sure to dial 77 00+country code+the number, i.e.77001... for US or 770048... for Poland), in fact it is much cheaper per minute to call the US or Canada(13AMD/$0.03) or Russia(30AMD/$0.08) than it is to dial Armenian networks.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Team Telecom Armenia</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.telecomarmenia.am/">[33]</a> (known as Beeline from 2006-2022, and ArmenTel before that) have a pre-paid card. Note: this option may no longer be available to those without Armenian residency, although Russians and Ukrainians seem to be exempted. As of September 2019, Beeline sim cards are also available at the airport for holders of EU passport (150min &amp; 7 GB data for 3500AMD).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ucom</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.ucom.am">[34]</a> has been operating in the country as Orange Armenia since mid-2009. The rate for all networks in Armenia 35AMD/$0.09, lower rates may apply within the network or for night-time calls, US or Canada(15AMD/$0.04), Russia(30AMD/$0.08). The company also offers fixed internet.</li></ul>

<p>Venders, small and big shopkeepers, taxi and marshrutka drivers tend to overcharge tourists, particularly Western tourists without knowledge of Russian. Observe what common people are paying and just follow their example or ask them.
</p><p>Traffic in Yerevan is not as chaotic as in Tbilisi (Georgia) and more car and bus drivers tend to reckon with pedestrians who have a green light when crossing a street. Strange that all zebra crossings are marked with the word STOP (not at the point where cars start to cross, but at the sides where pedestrians start to cross). Strange and perhaps unique in the world. Once you are on the zebra cars usually stop. However not always. So pay attention.

Take the minivan from the Mercedes showroom on Gai avenue northeast of the center at 10am to Garni or further to Gogh, then walk to Geghard. 40 minutes, 250dram. Alternatively, there are taxis near Garni temple taking tourists for 2000 dram roundtrip per vehicle to Geghard. You can also negotiate the taxi to take you to Yerevan center for an extra 4000 dram or so. Khor Virap is also possible for extra.</li>
<li><b>Khor Virap Monastery</b>. The local bus to Khor Virap leaves from a bus station behind the central train station (you have to go through the underpass under the tracks and metro station). It leaves at 9am and 11:00 am. Return times should be checked with the driver. The fare is 500 AMD. Taxis to Yerevan metro back charge about 4000 AMD. The closest bus stop is Pokr Vedi which is a one-hour walk from the monastery. Friendly locals may offer you rides, even in the low season.</li>
<li><b>Saghmosavank and Hovhannavank monasteries</b> overlooking the Kasagh River Canyon and the churches of Ashtarak.</li>
