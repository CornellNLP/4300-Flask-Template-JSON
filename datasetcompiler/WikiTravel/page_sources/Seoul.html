<p><b>Seoul</b> (서울) is the capital of <a href="/en/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>. Before, Seoul was the capital of the Korea from 1394 until the formal division of the country In 1948. With a municipal population of over 11.8 million, and a metropolitan population totaling over 25.6 million, Seoul is by far South Korea's largest city and one of East Asia's financial and cultural epicenters. Seoul also serves as the cultural, economic, business and political center of South Korea where skyscrapers towers over its buddhist temples. A fascinating blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge digital technology, home to endless street food vendors and vast nightlife districts, an extraordinarily high-pressure educational system and serene Buddhist temples, a trend-setting youth culture and often crushing conformism, extraordinary architecture and endless monotonous rows of grey apartment buildings, Seoul is a city filled with stark contrasts.

<p>Seoul is the largest city in South Korea as well as the political and economic capital. The city houses 11.8 million people, and the metropolitan area has 25.6 million, which is just over half of the population of South Korea. By some measures it is the world's second largest urban agglomeration, after <a href="/en/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>.
</p><p>Seoul has a long history stretching far back into Korea's dynastic past. There is evidence for settlement in this area as far as 18 BC but Seoul as the capital city of Korea has a history back to the 14th century. Originally named Hanseong (한성; 漢城), the city was the capital of the Joseon Dynasty from 1392 to 1910, and remained the capital of Korea during the period of Japanese colonial rule which followed under the name Gyeongseong (경성; 京城), or Keijo in Japanese. The Joseon Dynasty built most of Seoul's most recognisable landmarks, including the Five Grand Palaces and Namdaemun. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the city was re-named to its current name, Seoul. Since the establishment of the Republic of Korea in 1948, Seoul has been the capital of South Korea. Occupied twice during the Korean War by Communist forces, the city was extensively rebuilt and today is one of Asia's primary metropolises. 
</p><p>While few historical points of interest remain (most of the temples and palaces are reconstructions), much of Seoul's infrastructure is exceptionally modern and clean. Skyscrapers and high rises abound. The subway system is the third-largest in the world and perhaps one of the finest. Seoul is truly vast - though the casual traveler can see most of the main sites in a few days, a dedicated traveler could spend weeks exploring all the alleyways and far-off neighborhoods. As the capital of a country that has gone through massive development in the past sixty years, it is constantly changing at an incredible pace, matched only by the mainland Chinese cities. This frantic pace of life is reflected everywhere - in Seoul's cutting-edge digital technology, in the millions of commuters rushing to work everyday, in one of the vibrant nightlife scene, and in the thousands of buildings still under construction.
</p><p>In recent years, Seoul has been swamped with tourists from China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, following the success of Korean pop culture. Travelers will frequently overhear Japanese, Mandarin, or Cantonese; many restaurants and stores, especially in the more touristy areas like Myeongdong, will have signs in Japanese and Chinese as well as Korean and English. Long popular among Asians, Seoul has been relatively unknown in the West and frequently passed over by Westerners for nearby <a href="/en/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, <a href="/en/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="/en/Beijing" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, and <a href="/en/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. However, recently things have been changing; tourism numbers to Seoul have been exploding in the past five years or so, with no indications of slowing down or stopping.

<p>Seoul is a very well organized city covering over 600 km² with a population of around 11.8 million. It is a new modern city built on an ancient and shining history. The city is located in the north-western portion of South Korea approximately 40 km east of the Yellow Sea and 60 km south of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The city is roughly bisected by the Han River (한강 <i>Hangang</i>), which runs east to west across the city. Seoul blurs seamlessly into its surrounding satellite cities, most of which are also served by the Seoul metro. The largest of these is Incheon (to the west) in which Seoul's main Airport, and the area's main seaport, are located. Other satellite cities include such as Ilsan (to the north), Gwacheon and <a href="/en/Anyang" title="Anyang">Anyang</a> (to the south).

<p>Administratively, Seoul is divided into 25 districts (구 <i>gu</i>), each with an area and population comparable to a small city. The districts are then further subdivided into 522 sub-districts (동 <i>dong</i>). The Han river bisects the city, splitting it into two halves: Gangbuk (강북), the northern, more historical half, and Gangnam (강남), the southern, wealthier and more modern half. The sheer size of the city means that travelers to Seoul will find it difficult to locate a true "center" of Seoul; instead, Seoul is almost more like a collection of cities that happen to be bunched together, each with their own central business and commercial districts. The two largest core areas are Jongno/Jung in the north, and Gangnam in the south. For travelers with more time, there are many more, smaller centers and districts to be explored, such as the island of Yeoui-do and the college district of Hongdae/Sinchon. For the typical traveler, it would be useful to divide the city into the following areas:

<ul><li><a href="/en/Jongno" title="Jongno">Jongno</a> (종로) &#8211; The Joseon-era historical core of the city, containing most palaces and government offices. This district, along with Jung (중) district immediately to the south of it, makes up one of the main centers of the city. Here you can find the most famous of the Five Grand Joseon Palaces, <b>Gyeongbokgung</b>, with a long avenue attracting many tourists leading up to the main gate. To the east of Gyeongbokgung are clustered <b>Changdeokgung</b> and <b>Changyeonggung</b>, two more of the Five, and <b>Jongmyo Shrine</b>, the main Confucian shrine in the dynastic era designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. Sandwiched between these two areas is <b>Bukchon</b>, a quaint housing area filled with 'hanok', beautiful traditional Korean houses that also date back to the dynastic era.

It holds some of the few remaining European-style government buildings left over from the Japanese imperial colonialism era - the City Hall and the Bank of Korea, both in the west, centered around a large plaza often serves as a rallying point for protests and soccer games. Immediately to the southwest of the City Hall is <b>Myeongdong</b>, an large upscale shopping district that gets extremely busy at night and on weekends, and one of the top ten most expensive shopping districts in the world by rent. To the south of the City Hall is <b>Namdaemun Market</b>, another large shopping district that is decidedly cheaper than neighboring Myeongdong. Further south of Namdaemun is Seoul Station and <b>Namsan</b> Mountain, with the Seoul Tower at its summit.

This is also where you'll find <b>Itaewon</b> (이태원), perhaps the most culturally diverse area on the entire peninsula and home to dozens of restaurants featuring cuisine from the world over, numerous shops selling everything from custom-tailored suits to antiques, and several Western pubs and bars. Itaewon also has the only mosque in Korea, and as such there are a growing number of Middle Eastern and Pakistani immigrants. Talks are also finalizing on Yongsan International Business District, a $28.8 billion dollar project that when completed, will have a 665m centerpiece tower, the second tallest in the world.</li></ul>

<p>Seoul has a temperate climate with 4 distinct seasons that is heavily affected by the east asian monsoon season and Siberia. Winters are cold and dry and warm clothes are definitely recommended. Most of the season's winds blow from eastern Siberia, leading to colder temperatures than cities in the same latitude such as <a href="/en/Niigata" title="Niigata">Niigata</a> and <a href="/en/Qingdao" title="Qingdao">Qingdao</a> in Japan and China respectively. Most nights drop below -5°C (23°F) and days usually remain just above freezing. When strong cold waves hit the country, Seoul is usually one of the first cities that gets affected leading to temperatures sometimes below -10°C (15°F) and on extreme cases below -15°C (5°F). The most recent occasion was in January 2016, when a very strong cold wave affected a large part of Asia, the mercury in Seoul dipped to -18°C (0°F) for the first time in 15 years. The lowest recorded temperature is -22°C (-8°F). Precipitation is usually limited to around 60-70 milimeters each year (2.5-3 inches) and most of it falls as snow. 
</p><p>Spring and fall are by far the best times to visit since the city doesn't have neither too warm nor too cold temperatures. Just keep in mind that March and November still have chilly nights and that September falls in the Asian Typhoon Season.
</p><p>Summer is warm and very wet. Temperatures usually hover between 20°C (68°F) and 30°C (86°F) but occasional heat waves can push them as high as 35°C (95°F). The record high is 40°C (104°F) but such high temperatures are rare. What a visitor really needs to watch out during summer are the torrential rains, brought by the East Asian Monsoon. Most of it falls in July and August, in the form of thunderstorms, with these two months accounting for more than 60% of the yearly precipitation. Flash flooding can occur in the mountainous areas so one needs to be careful when venturing there and the weather forecast calls for rain. Typhoons very rarely hit Seoul itself but the remnants of those that hit the southern coast of Korea can bring heavy rainfall.

<p>Most visitors arrive via <b><a href="/en/Yeongjong_Island" title="Yeongjong Island">Incheon International Airport</a></b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>ICN</b>),(<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airport.kr/eng/">[1]</a>), located on <a href="/en/Yeongjong_Island" title="Yeongjong Island">Yeongjong Island</a> in the neighboring city of <a href="/en/Incheon" title="Incheon">Incheon</a> and covered in detail <a href="/en/Yeongjong_Island" title="Yeongjong Island">in its own article</a>. 
</p><p>Upon arrival, it is worth visiting a convenience store to purchase a <a href="/en/Korea,_South#T-Money_card" class="mw-redirect" title="Korea, South">T-Money card</a>. This is a rechargeable transport card that can be used on subways, city/local buses, a reasonable number of taxis and can even be used to make purchases at convenience stores. Along with ₩50 discount upon each bus/subway use, it also gives you discount for connecting buses from subway, or vice versa up to 5 times within 30 mins. You will be surprised that the ATMs in the airport don’t accept most foreign credit cards, therefore bringing cash can be very helpful. 
</p><p><b>Getting to Seoul from Incheon Airport</b>
</p><p><b>By AREX</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.arex.or.kr/">[2]</a>
</p><p>AREX or 'airport train 공항철도' connects Incheon airport to Seoul Station (for further connections to KTX high-speed services) and Gimpo Airport (most domestic flights and some International <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.seoulcheapflights.net/cheap-flights-seoul-japan/">flights from/to Japan</a>, China, and Taiwan), operating from 5:20 AM until midnight.  Two versions exist: Express services to the city (every half hour) takes 43 minutes and cost ₩9,000 or ₩7,500 with a group discount (with WiFi available on board), while all-stop trains (every 6 to 12 minutes) take 59 minutes and cost about ₩4,000. Some subway lines of Seoul are connected directly to the all-stop train, so consider it if you have plans to take subway to go on.  If you show your boarding pass from Asiana or Korean Airlines you get a discount when buying the ticket for the AREX Information Booth <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3000735">[3]</a>.
</p><p><b>By Airport Limousine Bus</b>
</p><p>If you have a lot of luggage, limousine buses are a good option.  <b>Limousine buses</b>(₩10,000 - 15,000 to/from city for one way, ₩6,500 to/from Gimpo Airport. They travel directly to major areas and big hotels in Seoul, while public buses (₩8,000-9,000) will take you to major transit hubs.  If you're visiting for the first time, it's worth paying a bit extra for the limousine bus. For either bus type, consult the big maps or staff to figure out which route best suits your needs; you can then find the shuttles outside 1st floor arrivals (if possible get this information from your hotel before arriving). Or simply, walk out and ask the many ticket sellers (they are wearing vests) which bus goes to your hotel because if it's a popular one or in a popular area, they'll surely know which you'll need. It's best to buy tickets at any of the ticket gates near the bus arrival area but you can also pay the fare using won or a T-Money card. The limousine bus drivers are extremely friendly but don't count on them knowing too much English. There are maps inside the buses letting passengers know which stops are upcoming and these are also announced in Korean and English. Pressing any of the red buttons inside signals to the driver you want off at the next stop.
</p><p>If you have a late flight and plan on getting into Seoul via bus, make sure you get out to the curb as soon as you can. The last buses run shortly after the last flights land. If you miss your bus, you'll be stuck paying for a taxi, as the trains will stop running too.
</p><p><b>By Taxi</b>
</p><p>A taxi direct to Seoul will cost around ₩60,000-90,000 depending on your destination. You are expected to pay any road tolls on top of the meter fare (usually 6,500 for the main bridge linking to Seoul). Having your destination written down in Korean will be very helpful. As both buses and taxis are subject to traffic, allow extra time for rush hour delays. Beware of drivers that might take detour or fake taxis that charge "tourist prices".
</p><p>Book a taxi, van, minibus, coach in advance<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.funtastickorea.com/en/van">[4]</a> to have the driver meet you upon arrival and pay fixed prices (no surprises). If you have children in tow, big group or lot of luggage, door-to-door service would be helpful.  
</p><p><br />
<b>Getting to Incheon Airport from Seoul</b>
</p><p>Take AREX, taxi or Limousine Bus. Leave ample time considering the traffic if you are taking taxi or bus. Rush hours are usually weekdays 8-10am, 5-8pm, all day on weekends or holidays. Traffic will get worse just before holidays. 
</p><p>It is worth noting that with some airlines you can check into your Incheon flight in Seoul Station before you get on the AREX train. Immigration officers are also on hand to stamp your passport, which means you are processed and can quickly go through the Diplomatic Departures entrance in Incheon Airport. However note, you can only do this if flying from Incheon on Asiana, Jeju Air or Korean Air.

<p>For most Koreans, especially upper class, the car is the preferred mode of transportation, which leads to huge traffic jams and chaotic parking situations, throughout the city. Taxis are common to get around since public transport doesn't cover large parts of the city, but are slow since they get stuck in traffic and can get expensive due to the extended travel time during rush hour. Use the subway whenever possible, but try to avoid the rush hour during weekdays. Street and subway signage is usually written in English as well as Korean.

<p>Koreans have been driving on the right side of the road since 1945 when it was more convenient to US and Soviet forces using their imported military vehicles.
Walking however, continued to go on the left side.
It was only in 2009 when it was formally decided to switch walking to the right as well.
You will see many markings on the pavement to encourage people in this.
However. Many people have not changed habits ingrained from childhood (haven't we all...), so many people continue on the left. Be prepared for the ensuing conflicts...
Be cautious when using pedestrian crossings. Cars are legally required to stop for pedestrians but often they won't stop, which can lead to dangerous situations.

<p>In Seoul, you can visit most places by using the subway system, the second most used metro transportation system in the world.  
</p>
<ul><li>There are currently a total of 18 lines (nine numbered lines, the AREX express airport line, plus a smattering of named suburban lines), all distinguished by different colors.</li>
<li>Some colours are quite similar to others, like the blue (or violet?) and dark blue line. In some representations this can be hard to distinguish, so look carefully. Colours also seem to be changed when there are major upgrades on the services. Some (formerly) blus lines are now shown in green on current maps.</li>
<li>Mobile phone coverage on the trains is excellent, under ground and above.</li>
<li>Wifi is available, too.</li>
<li>Transferring between lines might involve longish underground walks and a lot of stairs or escalators.</li>
<li>Plattforms are accessible through elevators which involves detours, though. While those are clearly marked inside the stations, it can be tough to find them from street level.</li>
<li>Many exits do not have escalators, so you might have to carry luggage up and down stairs (however, there will always be a lift/elevator available, it just might not be the closest exit to your destination).</li></ul>

<p>All signs in the subway system are in Korean (both <i>hangeul</i> and if applicable, <i>hanja</i>) and English.  Most signs also have Japanese and Chinese written names.  The signs leading to the platform for a particular direction of travel on a given subway line typically list the names of a number of stations in that direction. Stations each have a 3 digit number, but locals rarely make use of these numbers, and they're not on most subway maps, so don't rely on them. Note that the first digit gives the line number.
</p><p>On the platform, directions are indicated by giving the previous and the next station in the direction of travel.
</p><p>Be sure to search for updated subway maps as the Seoul metro system is constantly expanding and many maps even on the subway cars may not be the fully updated versions. A subway map can be found here:<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://cfs5.tistory.com/upload_control/download.blog?fhandle=YmxvZzExODM3MkBmczUudGlzdG9yeS5jb206L2F0dGFjaC8wLzEuZ2lm">[6]</a>.  Also be sure to download the KakaoMetro app for <b>IOS</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kakaometro/id1095533900?mt=8">[7]</a> or <b>Android</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.orizinal.subway&amp;hl=en">[8]</a> to transit around Seoul.
</p><p>Using navigation apps works on the trains, even underground. If in doubt of your direction or the next station, check on your smartphone.
Also, most trains have electronic displays showing the line, the next station and which side the exit will be on in English.
</p><p>It is a good idea to check the exit you want in advance using a navigation app. Exits are numbered and shown clearly on the platforms in yellow fields.
Some stations are extensive with long underground walks and getting the right exit lets you avoid detours and crossing busy roads.

<p>Subway fares are based on the distance traveled, but the shortest ride costs ₩1,250 (base charge with T-Money card) or ₩1,350 (single-ticket journey)
</p>
<ul><li>The base charge roughly covers up to 10km of the journey and ₩100 is added for every 5km beyond that.</li>
<li>Single-ride cards can be purchased from vending machines ONLY.</li>
<li>All vending machines accept coins and bills, up to ₩10,000 notes (and some ₩50,000 notes, but cash exchange machines are at each station).</li>
<li>Hang onto your card until the end of your trip, as you'll need it to get out.</li>
<li>Most of Seoul's automated card machines are equipped with touchscreen and full English support (along with Chinese and Japanese).</li>
<li>Since ticket machines may be crowded, buying two cards (one for each way) is recommended.</li></ul>

<p>If planning on using the Metro extensively or staying for more than a few days, you should consider purchasing a <b><a href="/en/Korea,_South#T-Money_card" class="mw-redirect" title="Korea, South">T-Money</a></b> stored value contact-less smart card. 
</p><p>Using this card will allow you to save ₩100 on all trips, and it will account for transfers between bus, train and subway instead of charging a single trip for each type of transport - these are common with Seoul's extensive subway system. It also saves the hassle from figuring out how much you need to pay or waiting in line to buy a single-use ticket.
</p>
<ul><li>Cards require a deposit ₩500 (refundable if you return the card at designated machines at each station).</li>
<li>Cash can be charged onto the card as often as you like.</li>
<li>Multi-day passes are available at approx. W10.000 per day and are limited to 20 trips per day. So they are useful from 8 trips per day.</li></ul>

<li>Blue buses go across town</li>
<li>Red-and-green 'G' (Gyeonggi) buses are intercity buses.</li></ul>
<p>Buses will only stop at designated bus stops and will not wait for indecisive travelers.
</p><p>Adult fare is as follows:

<ul><li><b>Cash</b> &#8211; ₩1,300</li>
<li><b>T-Money Card</b> &#8211; ₩1,200</li></ul>
<p>By using a T-Money card, you can transfer for up to 30min between bus and subway and don't have to pay twice but less or even 0 depending on the distance. Note that if you do not tag the machine as you leave the bus, you will be charged the maximum fare possible by the route.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_taxi">By taxi</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Seoul&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27" title="Edit section: By taxi">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>There are many types of taxis in Seoul.  Standard taxis will be an orange or silver color while deluxe taxis are black with a yellow sign and are more expensive than regular taxis but provide better and more comfortable service. For the most part, regular taxi cabs have leather interiors and the drivers are nice--so, for many people, "regular" in Seoul might be "deluxe" in their hometown. It is easy to hail a taxi any time of the day or night along any relatively major Seoul street with bright LED lights in the front of the windshield to denote an available car (빈차) or off if the car is taken. If the LED screen denotes "빈차" it means it is available and if it denotes "예약", it means the taxi is en route to a previously arranged appointment through a call service which may be used without fee when needed. 
</p><p>You can call a deluxe taxi wherever you are by calling 3431-5100. Sometimes, you can find a visitor's guide taxi or an international taxis exclusively for foreigners, a kind of deluxe taxi, the drivers of which know English and Japanese and can guide you around Seoul.
</p><p>The basic fare for regular taxis is, as of 2014, ₩3,000 (₩3,680 at night), with a surcharge of ₩100 applied according to time and distance. (The basic fare is up to 2 km, plus ₩100 per 144 m.) In deluxe taxis, the basic fare is ₩4500 and the additional fare increases in increments of ₩200. (₩4500 basic fare for up to 3 km, plus ₩200 per 164 m). International taxi drivers speak at least one foreign language (generally English) fluently.  International taxis use the same basic fare as regular taxis, plus an additional 20%.
</p><p>If there is more than one passenger, and you are traveling only a short distance (like 1-2 metro stops) it is usually cheaper to catch a taxi than to take a bus or subway. 
</p><p>In general, taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign language, so have your destination written in Korean to show to the taxi driver. It is also wise to get your hotel's business card in case you get lost. Some may even reject looking at a map so whenever possible, have the location written in Korean.
</p><p>All taxis advertise a free interpretation service that can be called if you need help. The phone number for the interpretation is on the window sticker of the back seats. Taxis that have an "On Base Authorized" sticker on the side, or a green sticker on their front bumper, are capable of entering US military bases in Seoul. These drivers are required to speak better English as part of their contract and may thus be easier for any English speaking tourists.
</p><p>Most taxis accept credit cards and T-money cards and thus have a V-shaped orange card sign on the roof of the taxi by the front passenger seat window. However, drivers generally prefer that you pay cash, especially for short rides.
</p><p>You can also ask for your receipt ("Yeong-su-jeung" 영수증).
</p><p>As in any other  city, there are some bad apples, and some drivers may take you the long way. Although the drivers often have a GPS device on the dashboard of their car, this is relatively meaningless if you do not know the area or cannot speak sufficient Korean to argue the point.  Korean taxi drivers have been known to take "the long way" when arriving to destinations when the passenger seems to be oblivious as to how to arrive at the respective destination.  Therefore, it is important to be tough-minded to keep the driver in check and to make sure he knows where the destination is.  However, you will have no problem getting to a destination if you have an accurate address as no place in Korea is unreachable due to its immaculate GPS systems. 
</p><p>In general, make sure the driver turns on the meter, get an idea of the cardinal direction of your destination (north, south, east, west), and use the interpretation service if you want to agree to a fare beforehand.  Meters are standard in every taxi in Korea and it is illegal to haggle for a negotiated fare.  
</p><p>However, keep in mind that there is often road construction or protests around Seoul, so sometimes a long route is necessary. If you suspect you are being ripped off, the most a non-Korean speaker can do is write down or take a picture of the driver's ID (located above the glove box) and report the details to the company.  Also, make sure to get into the taxi first then tell the driver of your destination as it is illegal and grounds for prosecution if a driver refuses to take passengers once they have entered the vehicle.

<p>Internationally known car rental companies like Hertz are in Seoul, just be prepared for a driving challenge and long rush hours. In addition, parking spaces are hard, if not close to impossible to find, especially during peak hours. Therefore, unless you are planning to head out of the city, it is not advisable to rent a car and you are better off relying on the excellent public transport system instead.

<p>Getting around in Seoul without a local escort (be it friend or cab driver) can be tricky, since this is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. While Seoul occupies less land than New York City, it can be more confusing. The major roads twist and turn, the various rail lines, rivers and mountains are obstacles and the smaller roads turn into a labyrinth of alleys. Most people will try to help you find your way around but often won't know themselves; best to familiarize yourself with some landmarks and the nearest subway stations. Learn the landmarks closest to where you are staying. The better-known landmarks in Seoul (such as the N Seoul Tower located in the center of town) can prove helpful at times. A compass will still work when a GPS fails.
</p><p>Once you know your immediate surroundings, you'll find that Seoul isn't such a huge place and the pedestrian approach can be an enriching experience. 		
</p><p>There's usually a subway stop within a ten-minute walk in any direction.
</p><p>Whether on bicycle or foot, the best way to escape traffic is to learn the rivers and streams. Most of these waterways empty into the Han River or another tributary to the Han, so look to the direction of water flow at any creek; chances are, it's headed for the Han. The Han runs right through town, generally moving West (sometimes Southwest; sometimes Northwest), so knowing where you are in relation to the Han is helpful. 
</p><p>The Han River as well as most streams are lined with massive parks that feature outdoor gymnasiums, multiple-lane bicycle paths, and 24-hour restrooms. Cars are generally not allowed. Pedestrian bridges on the smaller waterways are common.
</p><p>Numerous mountains with hiking trails can be found in the city.

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>See also: <a href="/en/Korean_phrasebook" title="Korean phrasebook">Korean phrasebook</a></i><br />
</p><p>As elsewhere in Korea, a grasp of basic <a href="/en/Korean_phrasebook" title="Korean phrasebook">Korean</a> will be helpful. If you plan on an extended visit, consider learning to read the Korean written script, hangeul. It takes very little time to pick up the basics, and it can be endlessly helpful.  A quick (free) visit to the Story of King Sejong Exhibition Hall beneath the Statue of King Sejong in Gwanghwamun Square will give you an introduction to the Korean written language and some interactive exhibits to practice.  Thirty minutes there will see you recognising and pronouncing some Korean words.  
</p><p>Shops in major tourists areas, including Insadong, Myeongdong, and Itaewon, will probably have staff that speak at least some English, and some may have staff that speak Mandarin, Cantonese and/or Japanese. While all younger Koreans are required to study English in school, due to a lack of practice, proficiency is generally poor, and most residents of Seoul only know a few simple words and phrases. If lost, a useful tip is to write down your question in simple words and show it to someone young. That being said, it is still possible to get by using only English, though it goes without saying that a basic grasp of Korean will make your trip much smoother.

<p>As the ancient seat of Korea's royalty, there are no fewer than 5 major palaces in Seoul, and some are definitely worth a visit. You can pay admission fee with T-money at the entrance(no additional discount applies). ISIC holder can get a discount at ticket office.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Gyeongbok-gung</b>(경복궁,景福宮), Yulgukno (<i>subway Gyeongbokgung</i> or <i>Gwanghwamun</i>).  This is Seoul's grandest Joseon Dynasty-era palace and the seat of power for centuries before it was razed in 1592 by a Japanese invasion (and again by the Japanese in 1910).  This was the first palace used by the Joseon Dynasty. Large parts have now been restored and the vast grounds also house the <b>Joseon Palace Museum</b> and the <b>Korean Folk Museum</b>.  Admission fee is ₩3,000, open 9AM-6PM (open till 7PM on holidays) daily except Tuesdays.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Changdeok-gung</b>(창덕궁,昌德宮), 99 Yulgong-ro, Jongno-gu (<i>Metro Line 3, Anguk station 5 min walk</i> or <i>Line 1, 3, 5 Jongno-3ga Station</i>). This palace is second only to Gyeongbok-gung (the original Gyeongbok-gung was built before Changdeok-gung but wasn't used for as long a time) in historical importance, this was first built in 1405 and was the seat of power between 1618 and 1896.  The buildings have all been recently restored and freshly repainted, creating a dazzling but still elegant effect that got the palace listed as an <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site" class="mw-redirect" title="UNESCO World Heritage Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>.  Buildings of particular note include the blue-roofed <b>Seonjeongjeon</b>, which was the King's office, and the <b>Daejojeon</b> ("Great Making Hall"), his bedchamber, but perhaps most famous of all is the <b>Huwon</b> ("Secret Garden") in the back.  Access to the complex is by guided tour only (₩3,000) except on Thursdays when only self-guided tours are available in summer from April to August. Korean-language tours run every half hour (Japanese-language tours also available) but English tours are only offered at 10:30AM and 2:30PM, and last around 60 minutes with a walking distance of about 2.5 km, including some steps and inclines for the Huwon portion (the grounds are wheelchair-accessible for most parts but may have to enter certain areas in a reverse direction from the group). Closed Mondays. Mainline bus (blue): 109, 151, 162, 171, 172, 272. Branch line (green): no.7025.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Deoksu-gung</b> (덕수궁,德壽宮), (<i>subway City Hall</i>).  Located in downtown Seoul across the street from City Hall, Deoksu Palace vividly contrasts to the other nearby palaces like Changdeok Palace. Built during the mid-fifteenth century, the architecture of the buildings inside are heavily influenced with Western designs.  Hence, you will see a fusion of both Korean and Western architecture. Closed on Mondays. Admission: Adults (19 to 64 years old): ₩1,000 (groups: ₩800), Children (aged 7-18) and soldiers: ₩500 (groups: ₩400), Children 6 and under, seniors 65 and over: free.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Changgyeong-gung</b> (창경궁,昌慶宮), (<i>Subway line 4, Hyehwa Station 10 minute walk</i> or <i>20 min walk from Changdeok-gung</i>). Originally built in 1104 as a summer palace for the Kings of the Koryo Dynasty, it became one of the main palaces during the Joseon Dynasty.  The palace was used as a temporary home for the King during the time Gyeongbuk Palace was being built. Unlike other palaces that has a North-South orientation, Changgyeong Palace faces East-West.  Also, what is famous about this palace is the fact it connects to Jongmyo Shrine, a holy place for the Joseon Dynasty, where sacrificial rites are practiced for previous kings and queens. Closed Tuesdays. Admission: Adults (19-64): ₩1,000 (groups: ₩800), Children (aged 7-18): ₩500 (groups: ₩400), Children 6 and under, seniors 65+: free.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Gyeonghui-gung</b> (경희궁,慶熙宮) and <b>Seoul History Museum</b> (서울역사박물관), (<i>Subway line 5, Seodaemun Station, exit 4</i>). Originally built in the 17th century, it was burnt down twice in the 19th century. It was largely destroyed by the Japanese during the colonial rule to build a school for Japanese children. It was finally restored in 1985 and opened to the public. Free admission.</li></ul>

<p>Seoul offers many excellent opportunities for hiking. The mountains in Seoul are at most 800 m (3,000 ft), accessible by public transit and the trails range from easy to difficult.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Mount Inwang</b> (인왕산) &#8211; Located in central Seoul, contains some shamanist shrines, and is the starting point for an easy hike along the old city wall that nevertheless offers possibly the best view of the city. Easily accessible from Dongnimmun Station on Line 3.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Mount Bukhan</b> Offers probably the best hiking opportunities in Seoul. It is in the north of Seoul and can be extremely crowded on holidays. To visit a popular area, take line 1 to Dobongsan station.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Mount Gwanak</b> &#8211; Gwanak station, line 1. The sammak temple is located in.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>4.19 Memorial Cemetery</b> &#8211; 224 people were killed during the April 19 Movement, and were buried in this cemetery. It became a national cemetery in 1995. This place has a museum, several statues, and a mausoleum. It is a popular park to learn about culture and heritage.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Boramae Park</b> &#8211; Formerly the site of the Korean Air Force Academy, which in 1986 turned into a park - Boramae, or hawk in English, symbolizes the Air Force. The size of the park is about 360,000 square meters and its sports facilities, a small zoo, a pond, and walking paths are well designed. The huge pond, which is 9,000 square meters, is surrounded by willow trees and benches, and people love to sit here. The pond is full of cool shades during the summer, and is spectacular when snow falls in the winter.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b> Namsan Park</b> &#8211; Located in the center of Seoul and considered a symbol of Seoul. Namsan Park is an ecology-island surrounded by urban districts.

<p>Korea has a long history of fermented and distilled alcohol, mainly from rice. In the 1900s, cheap and mass-produced soju(distilled spirit) and makgeolli(fermented, hazy rice alcohol ranging from 5~18% ABV) replaced and almost eradicated a variety of alcohols made within the country. However, many people are now interested in making and tasting different kinds of Korean alcohol.

<p>There is an immense demand for ESL (<i>English as a Second Language</i>) instruction in Seoul.  See the main <a href="/en/South_Korea#Work" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> article for details.
</p><p>Note that Seoul municipal government has decided to phase out foreign (<i>non-Korean</i>) teachers of English in all public schools. Although it has yet to be seen if this will be successful in practice, it may have an effect on your options in Seoul. Positions in private schools are still available. It is recommended to obtain a job through a reputable recruiter to avoid sketchy hagwons.
</p><p>Korea offers a working holiday visa program for citizens from a number of countries across the world. Those who hold this visa will likely be able to find bar/restaurant work in the nightlife spots of Hongdae, Itaewon and Sinchon (although those looking for work ought to be able to speak at least a basic level of Korean).

<ul><li><b>Gwangjang</b> (광장시장), This covered market near Dongdaemun offers a great array of Korean streetfood, and is particularly lively in the evenings. Walking distance from Euljiro 4-ga Station (Lines 2 and 5) and Dongdaemun Station (Lines 1 and 4).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Namdaemun</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Travel2/4">[29]</a>. The largest traditional street market in Korea. This market is located in the center of Seoul and is a famous shopping place for tourists. Clothing for children and accessories are the most-commonly sold goods in this market, but there's lots of food as well and many outdoor eating options, especially in the evening. There is also a huge digital camera market in this area. Take Seoul subway line 4 to Hoehyeon station and follow signs to exit #5.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Dongdaemun</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dongdaemun.com/">[30]</a>. This market is of equal historical significance to Namdaemun market.  While Namdaemun is an old-fashioned market, Dongdaemun market has large department store-like buildings such as Doota, Migliore, and APM that have trendy shops and stalls grouped together so customers can shop efficiently and save time.  Many younger people and tourists come here to shop. One of the buildings here, <b>Dongdaemun General Market</b>, sells <i>Chimachogori</i>, which is a Korean traditional dress, or bedclothes.  Some of the shops like <b>Nuzzon</b> are open all night.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Insa-dong</b>. Insadong is known for its art galleries and shops, and is possibly the most touristy place in South Korea.  It is a great place to buy cultural souvenirs.  There are also a few stores that offer interesting vintage toys and various kitsch. Insadong also contains many traditional tea and coffee shops.  It is one of the few places that vegetarian restaurants can be found.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ewha Women's University</b>. At the front gate of Ewha Women's University, visitors can find a dense market geared towards young women. You can find stores that sell clothes, shoes, hats, handbags, and so on. There are also clothes for men. Recently franchise stores have started to move into the area.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Yongsan Electronics Market</b>. (<i>Metro Line dark blue ,Yongsan stn</i>)Yongsan Station is in IMall which is another huge shopping mall with two storeys full of electronics. Without negotiating you can have cheaper prices when compared to amazon.com.  Yongsan is one option in Seoul if you are looking for electronics goods. Made up of over 20 buildings housing 5000 stores, you can find appliances, stereos, computers and peripherals, office equipment, telephones, lighting equipment, electronic games and software, and videos and CDs. A lot of the products are bought in Japan and resold in Korea by dealers. The market has a reputation for fleecing foreigners, particularly due to its proximity to the Yongsan U.S. Army Base. Be wary as Koreans try to avoid Yongsan for their electronics needs and rely instead on internet shopping as sellers in Yongsan are not averse to ripping you off if you don't seem to know a lot about electronics. If you go, it's best to bring a Korean guide so you can ensure you're getting a good deal. The problem is no or very poor English. Only Korean warranty. Cash prefered. At IMALL they add 5% as tax when you pay by Visacard. At Yongsan Electroland it dependes on the seller. Up to 10% addition is possible.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Techno Mart</b>. There are two Techno Marts in Seoul:
<ul><li>the new store at Sindorim station (use Sindorim station exit 2) has most of one floor dedicated to electronics, so it's a bit of a misnomer. It is more like a department store.</li>
<li>the original at Gangbyeon station houses over 2,000 stores across most of its floors that sell a variety of high-tech products. From electrical appliances to computers, you will find everything you need. However, do not expect cutting-edge technology or bargains relative to your home country (pricers are similar to what you would pay in most of Europe, for example).
<ul><li>The basement and first floors have clothing, cosmetics, accessories, and stationeries. The second and third floors comprise Korean-made electrical goods, while the fourth and fifth floors sell foreign-made electrical appliances. The sixth floor sells cell phones and their accessories. Computers are sold on the seventh, and on the eighth music and DVD stores. Aside from all the high-tech gadgetry, there are over a dozen restaurants on the 9th floor, and a cineplex and arcade on the 10th.</li>
<li>the 9th floor also has a roof terrace which offers a great view of the Lotte World Tower across the Han river.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Fashion shopping in Seoul isn't a mere industry, it's an art form.

Much of Korean social life revolves around food and the city is packed with restaurants, so it would take a determined person to starve to death in Seoul.  This fate may still befall you if you insist on English menus and meals consisting only of easily identifiable, familiar ingredients, so see <a href="/en/South_Korea#Eat" title="South Korea">South Korea#Eat</a> for a quick Korean menu reader.  An alternative is to just point and eat, your hosts generally will accommodate. If you look in the right places, a good meal (lunch or dinner) including side dishes can cost ₩5,000 or less (try basements of large department stores).

<p>In addition to Korean food, Japanese restaurants in Seoul tend to be excellent, featuring excellent sushi and sashimi. Chinese restaurants exist, but are typically adapted to suit local preferences.  There are a few Italian restaurants; these are generally excellent, with chefs trained in Italy, although flavors tend to be more or less Koreanized, with sugar in the garlic bread and meatballs.
</p><p>Big chains are common in South Korea as well, with so many cafes and bakeries. If you ever get a chance to visit Seoul, so many uniquely designed cafes are common there, so one would spend most of their time taking many pictures and eating delicious pastries and dishes.

</p>

<p>Seoul has plenty of budget places to eat. Everything from convenience store junk food and noodles to street stall food and lots of 24 hr Korean fast food restaurants. The 24-hour restaurants are great because they've usually got a wide variety of foods, including mandu, odeng, dokbokki, naengmyeon, udon and ramyeon. Prices do vary from about ₩2,000-9,000 at these restaurants. Also open late into the night are Korean BBQ restaurants, which are everywhere in Seoul.  These can be very cheap and are usually of good quality.  Barbecue options usually are limited to pork and beef, and they often come with a smattering of side dishes. Korean BBQ is, in itself, an experience that makes you feel like a Seoulite. The larger department stores in the city have basement food courts that offer excellent food (not recommended if you care about atmosphere).

<p>Seoul features a mind-bogglingly large array of nightspots catering to every taste and budget, often being considered the best and most vibrant in the world. While most cities feature only a few areas for nightlife, Seoul features many such districts in staggering size and array of locations to choose from.  Not only the sheer volume of bars and restaurants but also the relatively low cost of soju (the number one alcohol sold in the world) attributes to the lively nightlife atmosphere in the city.  
</p><p><i>Note</i>: Certain entertainment districts, such as Hongdae, are off-limits to American military personnel, U.S. government employees, contractors and their dependents.

<p>South Korea is the land of the coffee shops. It seems the amount of such places can easily compete with the number of convenience stores. Many Koreans dream of having their own coffee place, although with the oversupply of such places the profit is probably very low. There are many big coffee chains around, which you will see repeatedly. You should, however, opt for any one that is smaller and cosier.

A number of notable bars and clubs spot the area, both on the main street and in the nearby alleys, and the area has become more gentrified as more upscale restaurants and chains move in. Due to Itaewon's proximity to the nearby United States Army base, a large number of American military are found there in the evenings and weekends. However, the US army has decided to move the  base to a location outside of Seoul within the next few years, so expect regular changes to the area.
</p><p>Many bars in Itaewon celebrate Thursdays as Ladies' Night, which often means that women drink free before 12am. There are also a few gay bars located two alleys east of the main street, with a mix of clubs and places to drink.

The station is a transit hub and a ton of buses run through the heart of the entertainment area, so finding your way there is extremely easy.

<p>Sinchon (신촌), home to universities including Sogang University(서강대학교), Yonsei University (연세대학교) and Ewha Womans University, is a great place to soak up a more Korean environment. Not to be confused with Sincheon, which is closer to Jamshil, Sinchon is set up like many Korean entertainment areas in which bars, clubs, restaurants, karaoke boxes and sometimes even motels are structured in a grid-like fashion. The only way to familiarize yourself with the area is to stroll the alleys and discover all of the different places. Korean bars tend to be rather anti-social compared with their Western counterparts, with people sitting at tables with friends and not tending to mix. Yet a number of Western-style bars in the area have opened up.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Woodstock</b>. Around since 1991, the bar has prompted a slew of copycats but is the best place to hear classic rock and pop. The sound system is awesome and the owner/DJ knows his stuff. Expect large crowds Friday and Saturday nights and seeing people dance next to their tables. Great place to mix with Koreans of all ages.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Nori Ha Nun Saram Dul</b>. A basement bar infamous for both its great rock music and its decrepit interior with writing on the walls. Difficult to find and almost impossible to get a seat after 9 p.m. Secure valuables as theft is not uncommon in the bar.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Beer O'Clock</b>. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://beeroclock.ca">[36]</a> This Canadian-run bar serves great pizzas and other grub in addition to showing sports on the big screen and offering darts. Weekends are pretty wild at this joint.</li></ul>

<p>Hongdae (홍대), short for Hongik University, is the other premier club area in Seoul. Located around Hongik University, clubs and bars are strewn everywhere around the place. The clubs aren't near the station but aren't hard to find. 
</p><p>Some good all-around bars are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Spill Out</b> Fun spot out Hongdae exit 3 near many of the guesthouses. Good for solo travelers or clubbing pre-drinks. Only 15-20 seats or standing inside, but patio seating is good for warmer months. Run by Americans, good pizza, beer, bourbon, bar snacks, and shot-and-a-beer deals.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>B-Dan</b> on Hongdae's main strip, offers up take-out draft beer by the plastic cup.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Suzie Q</b> an LP bar playing classic rock and pop, near the 7-11 around the clubs.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bricxx</b> A hookah lounge with an intimate atmosphere and a large mixed drink and wine list.</li></ul>
<p>Some of the most popular clubs are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>M2</b> Trance/techno.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Cocoon</b> Hip-hop and dance music. Entrance: Thursday ₩10,000, Friday/Saturday ₩15,000-20,000.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>S Club</b> hip hop club.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Tin Pan (1,2,Euro)</b> A clubs/bars with cheap drinks and a dance floor. You must have a non-armed forces identification to enter.</li></ul>
<p>The place is huge and you could party for a whole week in all the bars and clubs. The best way to see it is to stroll around and find something you like. An interesting note: the entire club district of Hongdae is officially off-limits to U.S. military personnel, Federal employees and their dependents. However, it is not unusual to see crew-cuts here on the weekends since it is rarely enforced.
</p><p>Near Hongdae Park is <b>Joon's</b>, a popular little venue with a variety of clientele. They have beer pong, darts, and their own DJs.

<p>Apgujeong (압구정) is the upmarket area of Seoul. Walk around the streets and you'll see teenagers valet parking their new Benz or Audi, strutting their new designer threads, and looking generally, well, rich. That said, a lot of people who party here aren't necessarily rich and live far away. Apgujeong is rather subdued when it comes to nightlife though it has a few posh clubs and bars. Places where valet is unavailable are unlikely to be great hits traditionally. There are, however, a few small clubs in the area. Expect English to be more commonly spoken in this area, too, due many Koreans in the area having studied abroad or received a lot of private tutoring. This has also meant, however, a certain desensitization to foreigners, so don't expect people to stare or approach you as much as they would in other parts of Seoul. Consider Apgujeong a great place to hang out, not party. If you want to impress a date for example, this is a great place to go to. The backstreets of Apgujeong tend to sprout and lose new clubs seemingly at random throughout the year, so getting off the main drag from time to time can yield a new "hot club of the month."
</p>
<ul><li><b>Superclub Circle</b> usually playing house music, sometimes hip hop(only availible for private parties as of July, 2009)</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Club Air</b> House/Techno club.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Elec</b> Small, trendy club that is quite difficult to find.</li></ul>

<p>Seoul's has two unofficial backpacker districts, <b>Jongno</b> (Anguk/Sinseol-dong) to the northeast of the city and <b>Hongdae, Sinchon</b> out to the west.  Within walking distance to Dongdaemun Market, Jongno is better located for sightseeing and can be reached directly from Incheon Airport on limousine buses or city bus 6002 to <i>Sinseol-dong</i> stop (₩9,000, 90 min).
Hongdae, Sinchon area is located in university area. Yonsei Univ., Ehwa woman's Univ., Hongik Univ. and Sogang Univ. are around this area. so there are many restaurants, bar, club and shopping center and easy to be reached from Incheon Airport by limousine bus and Arex (Airport express train) in 1 hour.
</p><p>Alternatively, try a <i><a href="/en/South_Korea#Sleep" title="South Korea">jjimjilbang</a></i>. ₩4,000-15,000/night. You don't get a room of your own, but you can store your luggage into one of the small lockers and you can live quite cheaply for a long time, sleeping in the public sleeping rooms and enjoying the hot-tub and steam room facilities (sometimes a gym is available, also movies and TV shows often play until 11PM or so). To find a jjimjilbang keep an eye out for the the words jjimjilbang (찜질방) or 24 hr sauna (24시 사우나) in Korean. Not all saunas have jjimjilbang stay-over facilities to watch out for that. E.g. try <b>Dragon Hill Spa</b> at Yongsan station, ₩13,000/12h with overnight stay possible, but quite packed sometimes.

There are two large dormitories for men and women, plus a snorers' room which sounds like a dragon's lair. The dormitories are arranged unconventionally into lines of bunk beds, more like an open capsule hotel than a standard sleeping floor. In the communal area there are various hot rooms, an ice room, a large gym, a PC room, singing and games rooms and a restaurant.

<ul><li><b>Best Western Premier Seoul Garden Hotel</b>, formerly the Holiday Inn, located in the Mapo area across from Yeouido Island.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Co-op Residence Serviced Apartments</b>, Samseong, Ul-Jiro (near Dongdaemun Stadium), Western (Dongdaemun), Whikyung, Ohmok, Sincheon. From around ₩80,000 for very small but very comfortable single-bed studios to slightly larger double studios. Depending on the property, super-fast internet is either free or cheap (you need to ask for it). The staff are very nice but don't always speak more then rudimentary English. Some of them have restaurants that serve decent food. The Ul-Jiro Co-op is across from the Dongdaemun Stadium and Market and is a little worse for wear. The Samseong Co-op is newer and has heated floors for winter. All of them are handily located and are a fine place to stay if you are on your own. The bathrooms are tiny, as are the TVs.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Hamilton Hotel</b>, in the heart of the Itaewon shopping district, and next to the Itaewon subway station. Nice rooms, stay here to help reduce culture shock.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Han Suites</b>, in Chungmuro, right near Myeongdong. An unassuming building, it has a range for rooms from ₩80,000 for a reasonably-sized Studio through to ₩250,000 for a two-bedroom 'Premier.' Popular with both Koreans and expats, it also has super-fast internet at a reasonable price, they restock with fridge in the kitchen with free beer and water and a reasonable selection of TV stations (including ABC Asia-Pacific for homesick Australians). It isn't glamorous or in an amazing part of town, but it's a nice walk to City Hall through Myeongdong.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ibis Hotel Ambassador</b>. Walking distance to the COEX in Gangnam-gu at Samsung-dong, next to line 2 subway system Samsung. Convenient for international travelers as it is very close to the check-in and limousine server at KCAT, Korea Air City Terminal, next to the COEX.

Internet cafes known as <b>PC bang</b> (PC 방) (pr: pee-shee-bang) are ubiquitous in Seoul, and usually cost anywhere from ₩800-2,000/hr. </p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="/en/File:Roman-hangul.wikitravel.adams.JPG" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/4e/Roman-hangul.wikitravel.adams.JPG/300px-Roman-hangul.wikitravel.adams.JPG" decoding="async" width="300" height="225" class="thumbimage" srcset="https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/4e/Roman-hangul.wikitravel.adams.JPG/450px-Roman-hangul.wikitravel.adams.JPG 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/4e/Roman-hangul.wikitravel.adams.JPG/600px-Roman-hangul.wikitravel.adams.JPG 2x" data-file-width="3648" data-file-height="2736" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/en/File:Roman-hangul.wikitravel.adams.JPG" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>A Korean keyboard using a Korean OS can type in English or Hangul.</div></div></div><p>Most have printers at the front desk. These places cater chiefly to gamers, which translates into fairly fast computers, loud sound systems and large screens. Smoking is generally not allowed anymore. Typically, the computers run a Korean version of Windows Vista/7 and use Internet Explorer.  
</p><p>You won't find free WiFi in many places, although larger cafes do offer it and most accommodation will provide you with some level of access. Another way to connect Wi-Fi is going through Wi-Fi password sharing application on smartphone. There are many applications such as Wifi Map, Wifi Master Key and Waple. If you are planning to travel in Seoul, Waple could provide most of Wi-Fi network because this application is from South Korea. There are more Wi-Fi password data than other applications. However, three major telecom companies have licensed airspace almost everywhere (including trains, both subway and regional). These three companies are Olleh, T Mobile and LG's U+. You can buy prepaid vouchers for WiFi access to any one of these networks from convenience stores and they also allow you to buy online using a credit card. If you feel you need to be connected a lot but don't want to use your carrier's data when roaming, this could be a good option.
</p><p>The high-speed KTX trains offer free WiFi for passengers (30MB limit per session).
</p><p>Console gaming (Xbox 360, PS3) is widely available, and for those with proficiency in Korean language, you might also be able to enjoy a round of online gaming; the fantasy MMORPG <i>Lineage</i> was created in Korea and a slew of MMORPG titles not available anywhere else can be found here.
</p><p>
Post offices are basically everywhere in Seoul, although many are hidden on smaller roads and alleys. If you cannot spot any post office nearby, it is good idea to visit university (every university has its own post office in it). </p><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="/en/File:Postal_insignia_wikitravel_adams.JPG" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/0/03/Postal_insignia_wikitravel_adams.JPG/300px-Postal_insignia_wikitravel_adams.JPG" decoding="async" width="300" height="225" class="thumbimage" srcset="https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/0/03/Postal_insignia_wikitravel_adams.JPG/450px-Postal_insignia_wikitravel_adams.JPG 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/0/03/Postal_insignia_wikitravel_adams.JPG/600px-Postal_insignia_wikitravel_adams.JPG 2x" data-file-width="3648" data-file-height="2736" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/en/File:Postal_insignia_wikitravel_adams.JPG" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>The Korean postal insignia is orange and white.

<p>Seoul is a remarkably safe city given its size, comparable in safety to Hong Kong or Tokyo. Pickpocketing is not very common and violent crime is minimal if not almost unheard of. 
</p><p>If you happen to be a non-Korean male walking hand-in-hand with a Korean female, drunk older Korean men might give you a tongue lashing or occasionally worse. Note that this is far less of a problem than it used to be.
</p><p>If you do end up in a fight, remember that Korean law is possibly different to your home country. Just because someone else started the fight does not provide you with legal protection if the attacker ends up hurt. As in anywhere else in the world, get out of such a situation as quickly as you can. 
</p><p>U.S. military personnel now have a curfew 1am-5am 7 days a week on the Korean Peninsula, although the curfew can be extended at very short notice. If you are a westerner then the American Military Police may request to see your ID and, if you refuse, may summon the Korean National Police, who have the right to demand it.  (<i>This is done to catch American military personel breaking the curfews.</i>)
</p><p>Although rare, crimes by American soldiers against Koreans can happen, and when they do they often receive a huge amount of national attention. If you are a westerner then you should exercise some extra care when such a case hits the media, although it is still highly unlikely you would be in any danger.
</p><p>Large scale demonstrations in Seoul against the government happen from time to time. Often they can result in a riot where there are pitched battles between protesters and riot police. People do get seriously hurt, so try and avoid getting too close to the action.

<p>Over the last 15-20 years Korea has undergone a major English language boom. Korean families are eager for their children to learn English and commonly place them in private language schools. English is also a compulsory subject in public school from elementary grades on. Nowadays, a large number of high school aged to young adult Koreans on the street will have at least a rudimentary grasp of English.
</p><p>However, note with caution that the majority of Koreans will speak little English if not none at all, particularly the older generations. A few tourist information centers dotted around Seoul are staffed by English speakers, but by and large the average service provider will not speak English. 
</p><p>English signage is visible everywhere in the city, from road signs to subway maps to shop posters.

<p>Air quality in Seoul has improved significantly. However, there is pollution coming from China, Korean industries and the growing number of motor vehicles on the road. When approaching metro Seoul via train a visible dome of smog exists. Asthmatics frequently have acute problems, especially in the low-lying areas of town. Pharmacies carry a variety of allergy and smog masks, both of which are a common sight outdoors. If you are sensitive to such things, you may want to avoid visiting in spring and summer.
</p><p>Mold is common during the hotter months and the rainy season. While most common nearest rivers and streams, mildew and mold are also at many subway stations. 
</p><p>Mongolian yellow dust storms in spring have always been considered dangerous, but more so in recent years, as these storms blow across China's industrial belt, picking up toxins, before sweeping across the Korean Peninsula. Efforts to mitigate these storms include a donation of several thousand trees from South Korea to China. When dust storms come through Seoul, residents usually wear mask specifically for such dust and try to stay inside. Some locals refuse to travel these storms occur.

<p>Mostly, Koreans are very curious about foreigners. Many will gawk and glare while others will try out their English. For the most part, Koreans are very friendly on the street and will take great pains to be helpful, even approach you on their own initiative, if you seem to need help, despite the above attitudes. 
</p><p>If working in Korea, one should do a little reading on Confucianism and how it translates into social standing.
