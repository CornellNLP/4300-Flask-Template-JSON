</p><p>Consistently ranked among the world's top 10 destinations by TripAdvisor, the city and its surrounding region get more tourists every day.

<p>The old Hanoi is contained within four districts: Hoàn Kiếm, Ba Đình, Hai Bà Trưng and Đống Đa. These districts are vastly contrasted by the skyscrapers and shopping malls in the newer Western districts Cau Giay, Thanh Xuan, Ha Dong and Nam Tu Liem.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Hoàn Kiếm District</b> - center of the city, with its core in the Hoan Kiem Lake (Sword Lake). You most likely will stay and visit this district first. The fascinating Old Quarter covers its northern half while its southern half has mostly French architecture with shady streets and villas. A large number of foreign embassies are located in the southern half of Hoan Kiem. The district also houses a majority of Hanoi's tourist attractions, including Hoan Kiem lake, Ngoc Son temple, The Huc Bridge, the neo-Gothic Hanoi Grand Cathedral (St. Joseph's Cathedral), Hoa Lo prison, Eiffel-designed Long Bien Bridge, Hanoi Opera House and several museums.</li>
<li><b>Ba Đình District</b>: political center of Vietnam, housing the national assembly building, president's palace, Ho Chi Minh mausoleum and most embassies. It also contains the One-Pillar Pagoda and the recently discovered Thang Long Citadel. The French Quarter with large shady boulevards is in its eastern part. Its northeastern part surrounds the Truc Bach lake where John McCain's plane was shot down. Its western part is mostly residential with a large number of new skyscrapers around the Japanese Embassy on Lieu Giai street.</li>
<li><b>Hai Bà Trưng District</b>: located south of Hoan Kiem with the largest population of all districts. Its northern part also has French-style streets with big trees. A large number of universities, including the Hanoi University of Technology are located here. Times City, in the southeast of the district, is a huge shopping mall with an aquarium located within the complex.</li>
<li><b>Đống Đa District</b>: one of the original four central districts, is mostly residential. The Temple of Literature - Imperial Academy (Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám), Vietnam's first university, is located in the north end of the district, bordering Ba Dinh.</li>
<li><b>Tây Hồ District</b>: named after West Lake (Hồ Tây), one of the largest natural lakes of Vietnam. Thanks to its serenity and close proximity to downtown, it is a high-end residential area housing a large population of expatriates.</li>
<li><b>Cầu Giấy District</b>: houses a large number of universities, including the National University's main campus and Hanoi University of Education. The Museum of Ethnology, one of foreign travelers' favorite, is located in this district. Its southwestern part bordering Nam Tu Liem district has numerous high-rises, including Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower, Vietnam's tallest building. This is where you see a completely different side of a modern Hanoi, in contrast to the old inner districts.</li>
<li><b>Long Biên District</b>: the only urban district located east of the Red River, it is named after the iconic Long Bien Bridge. The Bat Trang ceramic village and Le Mat snake village are located here.</li>
<li><b>Thanh Xuân District</b>: houses Royal City, Asia's largest underground mall. Inside this mall, there are an ice-skating rink and a water park. The plaza above ground have large, cheesy looking Greek god statues.</li></ul>
<p>Other urban districts:
</p>
<ul><li>Bắc Từ Liêm District</li>
<li>Hà Đông District</li>
<li>Hoàng Mai District</li>
<li>Nam Từ Liêm District: a newly formed district, almost entirely consisting of high-rises</li></ul>

<p>Invading forces from every direction agree: Hanoi makes a fine capital. It has held that title for more than a thousand years, through several invasions, occupations, restorations, and name changes. The Chinese conquered the imperial city of Thang-Long in 1408 and renamed it Đông Quan. Le Loi repelled the invaders in 1428 and ascended the throne, becoming known as Lê Thái Tổ (黎太祖); for his efforts, a slew of legends about his heroic exploits, many centred around the <b>Hoan Kiem Lake</b> in the Old Quarter. 
</p><p>The Nguyen Dynasty gave the city its modern name of Ha Noi in 1831, but they had transferred power to <a href="/en/Hue" title="Hue">Hue</a> by then; it remained there until 1887, when the French made Saigon and then Hanoi the capital of all French Indochina. It changed hands again in 1954, when it was ceded to Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh after almost a decade of fighting, and it became the capital of North Vietnam; Saigon was the rival in South Vietnam. Upon reunification in 1976, it assumed that title for the entire country.
</p><p>The first institution of learning in Vietnam, Quoc Tu Giam, was founded here in the 11th century. Nine hundred years later, the first western-style universities in Vietnam were also founded in Hanoi. The city is one of the leading centres of scientific study and research in the country. Hanoi retains much of its older charm of bygone eras, despite the battles that have raged over it; conflict had the side effect of making it largely oblivious to modern architecture, and as a result, few buildings in the city centre area are higher than five stories. The Old Quarter is second only to <a href="/en/Hoi_An" title="Hoi An">Hoi An</a> for uninterrupted stretches of colonial and pre-colonial architecture, well-preserved on dense warrens of narrow, wonderfully atmospheric streets. It trades the commercial boom and sprawl of <a href="/en/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a> in the South for a more understated charm, worth enjoying for an extra day or two, and with countless transport options and travel agents, it makes a perfect base for exploration of the North.
</p><p>As you walk along the street, you may find that people start talking to you. It is a cultural norm there to make conversation with strangers. They might ask you where you are from and other general questions. It takes a while to get used to that. However, there are times when you find this friendliness extremely helpful, such as when you are lost or need help. 
</p><p>The <b>Tourist Information Centre</b>, ☎ +84 4 926 3366, Dinh Tien Hoang, just north of Hoan Kiem Lake, can provide a fairly useful map although bewilderingly, the blow-up of the Old Quarter is missing, making it useless in that part of town. The Centre also offers free internet and English-language advice.
</p><p>There are self-help interactive screen information booths around the Old Quarter but their purpose is to superficially conjure an image of coming-of-age "Vietnam has arrived" impression to the unsuspecting passer-by. An example was an inquiry typing out the American Embassy as prompted by an empty field, then it flashed on to the next interactive page asking for which district (one may not be aware that the US embassy has branches in every district) - smart and amazing!

<p>The climate is tropical, with wet and hot weather much of the year. But due to the city's latitude, temperatures drop drastically in the wintertime and the wind chill and dampness means winter weather can feel cold. If possible, avoid the summer months of mid May to mid September, as the city turns into a sweltering sauna with little to no wind.

<p>Most people arrive at the <b>Noi Bai International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>HAN</b>), 35km (45-60min) north of the city. For decades, the Noi Bai airport was small and heavily congested. Queues used to be long, but still shorter than Ho Chi Minh City's Tan Son Nhat. With the 2015 opening of the international terminal, immigration has become a lot faster, usually taking around 10-15 minutes. The new terminal is clean and modern with lots of sunlight. Shopping options however are overpriced and limited. Several airlines run flights from Noi Bai, including:

<ul><li><b>Express bus 86</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.facebook.com/BusExpress86/">[3]</a>: Hanoi opens a new high quality public bus from Hanoi train station to Noi Bai Airport. The bus stop is directly in front of the two terminals. Most airport employees would be happy to direct you there as well. The bus will run at 5:10 AM in the morning in Hanoi station and 6:30 AM in Noi Bai airport with an interval of every 20/30 minutes. It'll finish at 10:30 PM in the evening in Hanoi station and 11:30PM in Noi Bai airport. You'll spend 50-55 minutes/one way for transfer 30.5 kilometers from the airport. The authorities expect that having 80-94 round trips/day with 45.000 VND one way (28JUN2022). The purpose of opening the new bus improves transfer for tourist, especially, foreigners visiting Hanoi. Within Google Maps you can add the route map. For the Old Quarter it stops in front of the Post Office at Hoan Kiem lake. It also stops in front of the "Melia Hanoi" hotel: to catch a shuttle to the airport, wait at the bus stop across the road from Melia (not the stop directly in front of Melia).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Public buses</b> to the city centre from Noi Bai airport take about 1.5h. Bus #7 crosses the Thang Long bridge and goes to the Daewoo Hotel on the western part of Hanoi (almost an hour on foot to the historical centre of Hanoi). To catch bus #7 from the international terminal, exit the arrivals level and then left, keep walking right past the taxis and minibuses, past the outside restrooms and to the bus stop which is located in the corner of the parking lot and is equipped with an easily noticeable shelter. <b>Bus #17</b> goes straight to the Old Quarter (Long Bien bus terminal), it doesn't stop at the international terminal (<b>March 2016</b>), perhaps as a courtesy to local taxi drivers milking the touristic cash cow; however it does serve the domestic terminal, which is just 1 km away from the international terminal in the eastern direction (upon exiting the international terminal, walk to the left, past the bus#7 shelter and follow the pedestrian walkway conveniently connecting the two terminals).  Luggage is permitted aboard the buses, <b>as of March 22, 2016</b>, you're not supposed to pay extra for it, unless it's the size of a tiger cage. Ticket price for bus #17 is VND9000, as of March 2016. Don't listen to taxi drivers or shuttle bus operators that claim the stop for the public buses is a few kilometers away or that service has been terminated. Public buses operate 05:00-22:00. <b>Bus 90</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.facebook.com/xebus90/">[4]</a> begins at the international terminal bus stop then to the domestic terminal, and ends at Kim Ma bus station with stops on Lac Long Quan, Hoang Hoa Tham, Van Cao, Lieu Giai, and Kim Ma.  This direction operates from 06:40-22:30. From Kim Ma station to the airport (domestic terminal first, ending at the international terminal), the bus goes along Giang Vo, Kim Ma, Lieu Giai, Van Cao, Thuy Khue, Lac Long Quan. This direction operates from 05:30-21:10. Tickets are 9,000VND and the buses are orange. The journey takes about 55 minutes. Many locals and airport workers take the #90 bus, so space is limited. There are no luggage racks available on this bus.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Shuttle-buses</b> from the airport to Hanoi stop at the Vietnam Airlines Office on 1 Quang Trung (a bit south of the old quarter but conveniently stocked with taxis and motorbike drivers, of course!). Tickets are sold in the building in front of which the minibuses park, or you can give the fare directly to the driver. The fare is USD2 or 40,000 dong for foreigners (insurance reasons), and 35,000 dong for Vietnamese (which includes Vietnamese-Americans), which rate is indicated on the sticker fixed to the bus's body. The driver will potentially give you trouble if you have additional bags, but if you push, you will get the same USD2 rate. They also try the 'typhoon in Ha Long Bay' scam whereby they take you to a street where you cannot see the hotel name and tell you that the Ha Long Bay guests are still in the hotel and they will take you to their other hotel for the same price. This place is a complete dive facing the highway. You should also beware the drivers trying to offer you a ride to your hotel for USD5, claiming the Old Quarter is 5km from the office - it is much cheaper to go to the Vietnam Airlines office and switch to a taxi (or walk, it's not more than 2km to anywhere in the Old Quarter). The taxi will not cost more than the USD3 price differential and if it does, you should refuse to pay as the driver has cheated you somehow. They say that the shuttle buses go to the airport hourly, but they will only leave when the bus is full (took 2+ hours in one case) and will not tell you this. Meanwhile the taxi drivers, who are supposed to offer the same service, will constantly offer to take you to the airport. Despite the fact that the shuttle buses are supposedly run by Vietnam Airlines, the employees in the office across the street don't have any information on the buses, and tourists will get scammed (or waste time) if traveling alone. Note: <i>as of October 2014</i> it's been observed that 4 Vietnamese sharing a taxi paying around VND50,000 each. So it's possible to go with an un-metered taxi for VND200,000-300,000 from the Vietnam Airlines stop to the airport depending if there are too many taxis in the stop and it's convenient for them or not.</li></ul>

<p>Passengers on Vietjet Air can take their airport shuttle at VND36,000 one-way, booked through their website. Buses leave hourly and the journey takes about an hour. The shuttle passes both terminals, Nhat Tan Bridge, Nghia Do Park, Daewoo Hotel, Kim Ma bus station, Hanoi train station, and ends at Thong Nhat Park on Tran Nhan Tong St.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Taxis to central Hanoi can be hired at Noi Bai</b>. There are fixed price taxi stands right outside the exit, offering fares ranging from USD15-25 into the city. These are provided by various taxi companies and are slightly more expensive than the tout taxis, but fixed price, so no hassles about the fare. Later into the night, there don't seem to be any physical taxi stands, however you can still negotiate directly with taxi drivers for fixed prices all the same. Some taxis will engage in negotiations while others will agree only to metered fares so shop around. Drivers in general may try to take you to a hotel of their choice or even a hotel pretending to be the one you named (your passenger door being opened by a person showing you your hotel name and correct address on a clipboard, insisting you should come in) as destination, to collect a commission, so be very specific about your destination ahead of time and on arrival if this happens, as they usually give in. To be sure, have the address ready and maybe print out a map beforehand: since every street in Hanoi has clearly visible street signs at both ends, you should be able to discern which street you are in. Non fixed-price taxi agents will quote prices ranging from around USD15-30 as you leave the airport, so be sure you have a clear price agreement also with the driver before getting into the car, as the price quoted by the agent may not be what the driver is expecting.</li></ul>
<p>Be careful of agreeing to operating the taxi meter: the meter may be tampered with, and can run upwards of USD40-60 or more to get to central Hanoi, and the upper limit is entirely out of your control. If you have changed money into dong at the airport you can, of course, pay in local currency. <b>November 2014: there is no longer an official fixed price taxi service from Noi Bai to the city!</b> It may be possible to negotiate something with an individual driver, but they will generally request you use the meter. The total cost will vary between around 325,000-475,000 depending on the company and your destination. It may also be possible to secure a lower (fixed) rate if you book in advance. <b>April 2015</b>: Taxi drivers will still agree to a fixed price and most quoted 350-400k to the Old Quarter which is the same that a properly set taxi meter will run (driver agreed to 360k and taxi meter ended up at 358k, using silver/pink ABC taxi).
</p><p>There are a few official looking tourist information booths inside the arrival hall that will offer rides into the city for significantly higher prices than the taxi stands outside -- USD25-35 per car as they tell you not to take the cheaper taxis outside because of various scams.
</p><p>To sum things up, taking a fixed-price taxi from one of the companies outside of the arrival hall is the least costly way with the least risk of surprises to get to your destination. However if you do this, as mentioned above, make sure to be very clear on the agreed price with the taxi driver himself and confirm that the taxi driver agrees to take you to your hotel's exact address.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Motorcycle taxis (xe om)</b> are not allowed at the terminals, but can pick you up from the motorcycle shelter 300m outside the international terminal (turn left as you exit). A motorcycle taxi ordered through the Grab app will cost about US$6-7 for the 45min ride to Hoan Kiem District. Motorcycles are not allowed on the main highway, but will take parallel slip roads instead. You'll make up the time once you enter town and buses/taxis get ensnared in traffic.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Private Transfer</b> pick you up from the airport and drop you off at your hotel. The driver will holding the paper with your name that you can easily to recognize them. Cat Ba Express is one of some company provide this service, they did a good job for their business. With the price only $18 for 4 seaters car or 7 seaters car with $20, they will waiting for you at the airport even your fly delay for some reason. They also provide 16 seaters or more than that, you can feel free to contact them at "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://catbaexpress.com/">http://catbaexpress.com/</a>". You can chatting with them and they will ask for some detail then they are willing to send a confirmation through your email (normally other place ask you to order through their email at the first time and it is watse so much time to contact and reply) then you can just confirm everything are correct or not. ALl the payment you can pay when you get in the car.</li>
<li>They also provide a private car to some famous place with a really good price that your all family can travel by yourselves.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you already have a hotel booked, you might ask the hotel to dispatch a driver. The nicer hotels will do this and put the fare on your room bill. An $18 fare is fair for an airport pickup, and it is possible to get to the airport for $15 (Oct 2015).</li></ul>

Tickets can be purchased from Hanoi Station, too. In Hanoi Station, international ticket booth clerk may go to work much later than other booths', like 09:30 in the morning. A ticket for a soft sleeper compartment (4-berth compartment)  costs 1.060,000 dong per person. Be cautious buying these tickets from hotels or travel agents in the Old Quarter, as they may quote prices substantially higher. If you are taking the evening train out of Nanning, you will arrive at Gia Lam very early in the morning. Be sure to change some of your money at the border so you can get a cab to take you to the city when you arrive in Gia Lam. Exchange the rest of your money for a better rate in the city the next day.
</p><p>All other trains use the main <b>Hanoi train station</b> for daily services from cities in the south including <a href="/en/Hue" title="Hue">Hue</a> and <a href="/en/Nha_Trang" title="Nha Trang">Nha Trang</a>. The <b>Reunification Express</b> goes all the way to <a href="/en/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, although there is very little 'express' about it.

To board trains bound for these destinations, you have to enter the railway station compound through the "backdoor" at <b>Tran Quy Cap station</b>. Just tell your driver which destination your train is heading to. Be mindful of any "helpful" stranger who offers to carry your luggage - he probably has a sum more than the cost of the ticket in mind for the help.
</p><p>Tickets for all destinations are sold in the main station, though there are two counter halls, north and south, serving the respective destinations. 
</p><p>Technically, there is a queuing system in place to buy tickets at Hanoi Station which involves obtaining a numbered docket and waiting to be called up to one of the ticket counters. In practice, the process is chaotic and many locals disregard the system altogether, often pushing their way to the counters to be served (<i>Update April 2013</i>: nobody uses the queue any more; instead fight your way to the counters or you will be waiting around for hours). If travelling to Nanning, China, it is advisable to ask a staff member where to go, as not all counters can sell these tickets. 
</p><p>Buy your tickets as early as possible, especially since sleeper-tickets can be sold out several days in advance. If you can't get a ticket any more, try a travel-agent who still might have stocks. You may also try your luck in the station just before boarding time, agents still holding tickets will be eager to sell as the departure draws near. Nevertheless, travel agencies in Hanoi are known for their bad business practices. Some of them will try to overcharge you up to 300%, so it is better go to the train station by yourself and find out about the prices before you agree on any deal.

<p><b>Taxis</b> are the best way to travel long distances, but the <b>cyclos</b>, or pedicabs, are a cheap way to make shorter trips. Taxi fares are not always consistent, and the rates for each taxi company have not been standardized. For lone travellers, rides on the back of <b>motorbikes</b> (actually low-powered scooters) are popular too (known as <i>xe om</i>, literally meaning motorbike-hug).  <b>Uber</b> has also launched in Hanoi, and while they has a few districts they operate on, they do offer more consistent pricing than taxis.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_taxi">By taxi</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Hanoi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: By taxi">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Use only reputable and reliable taxi companies, which include Hanoi Group Taxi (+84 4 3856-5656) and Mai Linh Taxi (+84 4 3861-6161). As a reference, Hanoi Group Taxi charges an initial fee of VND14,000 covering the first few kilometres, then VND16,300 for every additional kilometre, with 6,000 dong for every 5min of travel. Thanh Nga Taxis (+84 4 3821-5215) are cheaper with smaller, hatchback cars, starting at VND9,000 and VND12,000/km.
</p><p>Some drivers will attempt to negotiate a flat fee in advance rather than use the meter. If you have a fair idea of how far you're going or how much you're willing to pay, this is probably a good idea. If the driver refuses, turning around and walking away will almost certainly change his mind.
</p><p>It has become common for drivers of less reputable companies to "fix" their meters to run faster. While meters may operate "normally" initially, they start jumping faster after you've let your guard down. A 10min drive can rack up almost US$30 in downtown Hanoi alone! Some taxis are known to lock passengers in and demand large amounts of US dollars before letting them go. The driver may threaten to have you beaten up or arrested, but will let you go if you kick up enough of a fuss.
</p><p>Another common scam is that the driver takes you for "sightseeing", and extends the tour to make more money. This is very hard to discover unless you know the city well, but if you catch your driver doing this (e.g. going around Hoan Kiem Lake twice), demand that they stop the taxi and leave the taxi without paying.
</p><p>Most taxi drivers speak limited English, so it's a good practice to get your hotel to write the name and address of you destination in Vietnamese to show the taxi driver, and get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.
</p><p>Be vigilant when taking a taxi; the driver may jump out at the destination and dump most of your bags out of the trunk. While you're busy putting your rucksack on, he has taken off with your other bags.
</p><p>When getting off your taxi wait for the driver to open the door, or check both front and back to see if there are any motorcycles whizzing past before opening your door. Although Vietnam is right-hand traffic, ghost motorbike riders could be approaching your taxi on the wrong side.

<p>Motorbike drivers ("Xe Om" in Vietnamese) can be found on virtually every corner, especially in the Old Quarter. Expect to be offered a ride every half-block (or more). You should absolutely negotiate a fare in advance. As a general rule, a reasonable fare should cost around 10,000 dong per kilometre of travel for a motorbike (possibly varying 10,000 dong in either direction), so know the distance you are travelling or understand that you have no real basis for negotiating a fair rate. Walk away towards the next street filled with motorbike drivers if you don't like their offer, as this is an incredibly reliable bargaining technique. There are far more drivers than tourists, and they know it - your fare could be the only one they get all day.
</p><p>You should also write down the negotiated fare (with all zeros) to avoid confusion. Even if you do speak Vietnamese, a driver might mis-hear (accidentally or intentionally) that you said 50,000 dong instead of 15,000, In case of argument over fares after the ride, keep calm and repeat the original agreement (remember, you have the leverage). Many drivers will accept US dollars as well. At the end of a ride, some will offer to hang around to drive you to your next destination - either be clear that you don't want a return ride (and don't go near him when you leave), or get a price in advance. Otherwise, you might be surprised when the driver tacks on several million dong for having waited.
</p><p>Keep your wallet out of arms reach of the drivers when you pay, less honest motorbike drivers are not adverse to helping themselves to the cash they think they are entitled to and promptly taking off without waiting for your consent.

(VND100.000 for 1 hour is good price, included tip - you have to agree this beforehand.)
</p><p>Be aware that it is common for cyclo drivers to agree to a price, then take you to a different place, pretend to be confused and hit you up for more money when you reach your destination.
</p><p>If you chose to travel by cyclo, be clear on your destination, negotiate your fee first (100,000 dong is more than fair for a 30-34 minute ride in any direction), be willing to get out and walk away (if your driver tries any monkey business), also be willing to walk away at the end of the journey if the driver won't stand by your original agreed price.

<p>Motorcycles can be rented for around USD5-6 a day, and can be arranged by most hotels. A typical bike will be given with 1 litre of fuel, so top up at the nearest petrol kiosk. Queue up with the other bikes, unscrew your fuel cap and hand over your money (USD1 per litre) to the attendant who will top up your bike for you. 
</p><p>This is good for making lots of trips around the city for individuals or duos, but be careful: Hanoi is a great place to sharpen motorbike skills, provided you emerge alive. Park on the sidewalk with other bikes, and be sure to lock the front wheel. Locals will help arrange the bikes near their stores.  Many shops that have bike attendants will give you a ticket in exchange for parking your bike.  This may or may not come with a fee (typically ranging from 2,000-5,000 dong). However, parking at Hoan Kiem lake on a weekend can go up to 10,000 dong. The ticket will either have your license plate number written on it, or the ticket itself will be numbered, with that number subsequently chalked somewhere on your bike.  In such cases (where you've been given a ticket), the attendants may ask that you NOT lock the steering column or front wheel of your bike so that they can rearrange the bikes as customers come and go.
</p><p>Riding outside the city is a refreshing change. Winding through the alleys and through the local markets inaccessible by cars allows you to see Hanoi from a different perspective. Google maps are rather useless once you leave the city due to the number of small lanes, forked roads and roundabouts that do not show up on the map. Stop and ask locals for directions, so be sure to brush up on the correct pronunciation of your destination!
</p><p>The Riverbank fields just past the flower market can be a great trip within the city stop at the KUB Cafe on route and the staff there will give you some suggested routes around the flower fields.

<p>Motorcycles can be bought and sold by foreigners. Many travellers opt to buy their own bike and ride it throughout the country. A lot of riders prefer to start in Hanoi and ride to Saigon as popularized by the British "Top Gear" TV series (although they did it the other way round and swapped to the train for the second half). Many people are unsure about the legality of purchasing bikes in Vietnam. Technically it is illegal for foreigners to own bikes in Vietnam without the proper documentation. However, this law is not enforced and thousands flock to Vietnam annually to buy bikes and ride them all over the country. It is possible to convert your driving licence from your home country to a Vietnamese licence, but few people go through this trouble. It is a well-known fact among riders that the police in Vietnam are highly unlikely to carry out routine traffic stops on foreigners. As long as the rider cares for his or her own safety and the safety of other road users they can go the entire trip without hassles. Most vendors do not sell bikes, they only rent them. There are some trusted companies selling bikes in Hanoi with good track records. The KUB cafe (Kustom Urban Bike)  #12 ngõ 264 Âu Cơ, Tây Hồ, Hà Nội offers a great starting point for your journey by motorbike or a great place to end your trip in Vietnam, It's run by bikers for bikers of all sizes.

<p>Scam free, cheap but a bit difficult to comprehend at first, the <b>buses</b> in Hanoi are relatively fast and surprisingly comfortable. Pick up a map with printed bus lines at the Trang Tien street (the book street by the Opera house) and spend a few minutes to identify the more than 60 bus lines, find your bus stop, wait for the bus, get on and off you go. On the bus you pay the 7,000 dong to the conductor who will come to you. If you are unfamiliar with the city, make sure to tell the mostly helpful conductor where you want to get off. Stops are often unannounced and do not have signs with their names on them, although there are now some newer buses with LED displays and lilting voices announcing the next stop. It's best to ask the driver or conductor when to get off.

<p>Hanoi's traffic is chaotic, with seemingly perpetual traffic jams, and a large number of almost suicidal motorcyclists and pedestrians. As such, driving yourself around is not recommended and because the International Driver's License is not allowed in Vietnam, and you should leave your transportation needs in the hands of professionals.

It includes cars crashing through walls to represent the chaos of post-war American capitalism, soldiers charging around with electric plugs, a cave hideout re-imagined as the inside of Ho Chi Minh's brain, and several other post-modern confections integrated with the main story of the man's life and his country's struggle. One of the more informative museums in Vietnam, albeit with a high dose of personality cult and political propaganda.

It's the locals' favourite leisure spot, and a great place to watch people practising <i>tai chi</i> in the morning or to sit and read in the afternoon. <i>Hoan Kiem</i> means "returned sword", and the name comes from a legend in which King Le Loi was given a magical sword by the gods, which he used to drive out the invading Chinese. Later, while boating on the lake, he encountered a giant turtle, which grabbed the sword and carried it down to its depths, returning it to the gods from whom it had come. (You can see a version of the legend at the <b>Water Puppet Theatre</b> - see below.) Rumour has it the giant turtles still inhabit the lake.

A visit to Ca trù Hanoi Club should be the first priority for ones who love Asian traditional arts and aristocratic court music. Ca trù is an unique and fascinating genre of chamber music in Vietnam which traces it roots back to the 10th century. It is performed by a female vocalist who sings a repertoire of poetic melodies using her <i>vibrato</i> and unique breathing techniques. Rhythm is kept using a<i>phach</i>, which the singer manipulates by striking three wooden sticks against a bamboo bar; an accompanying instrumentalist plays the three-stringed lute <i>dan day</i>; a drummer using a small drum completes the trio. The songs are all fascinatingly restrained and expressive, at times hauntingly beautiful. Today, ca trù is promoted by the government of Vietnam as the country's national asset, and it was officially recognized by UNESCO as one of the Intangible Cultural Heritages of humankind in 2009. Attending a "ca tru" show in Ca tru Hanoi club is highly recommended for those who enjoy traditional performing arts. The atmospheric combination of sitting in a temple courtyard, imbued in soft lighting and sipping Vietnamese tea while ca tru is sung leaves a pleasant impression. Translation is provided by volunteers.  </span> <span class="price">The price of a single ticket is 270,000 Vietnamese dong (c. USD12, but only Vietnamese dong are accepted). You can ask your hotel to book it for you at the same price</span>. </span></li></ul>

A visit to the water puppet theatre is a real highlight of a trip to Hanoi. Live musicians accompany folk legends from Vietnamese history, told with wooden men, women and dragons, dancing and splashing on the face of the water. The narratives are sung in Vietnamese, but a list of titles is available in several languages.

Even in the 21st century, they still elicit an ahhh moment from the audience. Tickets are 60,000 and 100,000 dong. There are several performances throughout the day, and it's even possible to buy tickets even if the showing is going on for 15 minutes.

<p>The streets of Hanoi have heavy traffic and make running difficult.  The lack of regard that scooters and vehicles have to pedestrians make running through the streets dangerous.
</p><p>There is, however, a lake south of the Old Quarter, called Hồ Hoàn Kiếm that offers a path around the lake, and good views of the Turtle Tower (Tháp Rùa) at the south end and the Temple of the Jade Mountain (Ngoc Son Temple) at the north end.  At 5am there are usually a number of locals running and working out around the lake.  The foot traffic at peak times around the lake is manageable for a run, and the area is well lit, with plenty of commercial businesses surrounding the lake.  The distance for one lap around the lake is 1.6 kilometers (1 mile).

Reiki Healing
The word ‘Reiki’ comes from two Japanese words – ‘Rei’ and ‘Ki.’
‘Rei’ is the universal life force, and represents spiritual consciousness or universal knowledge, whereas ‘Ki’ simply means energy.
We are all made up of energy. The energy flowing through our body nourishes organs and cells, keeping our physical system healthy and strong. When this energy is disrupted or blocked, it may weaken the vital functioning of our organs/cells causing physical pain or discomfort. And at the time it departs, we die. Reiki is used to cleanse your energy pathways, thereby healing your body, mind, and soul. It increases the vibratory level of energy field and prevent you from getting sick. visit for more info: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://ashtayogaindia.com/reiki/">http://ashtayogaindia.com/reiki/</a>

<p>Overcharging is common in Hanoi, especially on tourist markets. The mentality here is that "it is acceptable to rip off rich" - many sellers truly believe this is how they take back what was "stolen from them". Of course "rich" is defined as "anyone with more money than me". This is not limited to white foreigners only, even Vietnamese, especially from South, are routinely overcharged in Hanoi. A number of sellers won't even haggle at all after quoting a ridiculous amount, as they would rather sell a single item with 2000% profit than sell much more for a reasonable price. So if you're going to other cities, do your shopping there.
</p><p>If you do need to shop in Hanoi, try to buy from younger sellers, they seem to be more honest than older sellers. Which means they'd only try only to ask 4x of the item price, and not 10x. Also at the tourist markets some stalls have "no discount" sign, and those typically offer prices much closer to reality, which should be used as a reference. Note that in Hanoi it still won't prevent a seller at the next table to ask twice the price of the "no discount" table for the same item.
</p><p>Avoid sellers who set prices in dollars/Euro, as this dramatically limit your ability to haggle. Note that even $1 is still too much for many souvenirs, for which the fair price is 20,000 VND.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Money_Changers">Money Changers</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Hanoi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40" title="Edit section: Money Changers">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Money changers are usually in most guest houses and banks, and they give bad rates. Don't exchange money from the black market people on the streets. The best place to exchange money is at Ha Trung road and Hang Bac where they give real good rates. Just walk into the gold shops or jewellery shops and ask them if they change money and ask to show their rates. Ask up to nearly 5 or more shops to see which shop gives the best rates. Best rates are at Ha Trung which is 15-25 mins walk West from Hoan Kiem lake. Look for Hang Da Market on the pedestrian map.Its a short street of Gold traders, and small sewing factories.Correct as at Dec 18th 2014.
</p><p>Inside the Noi Bai airport arrival hall, there are several money changer booths of major local banks; unlike in many airports, their exchange rate is competitive (around +/-1% to mid-market for USD) and do not seem to differ from the rate in the city offices (which you won't find at Old Quarter anyway). Besides US dollar and euro, they will change currencies of major Asian countries; that may come handy if you come from (or was traveling in) these countries. Rate vary slightly between the banks, so you may like to shop around and to see what you will get.
</p><p>Currencies accepted for exchange (into Vietnamese Dong: VND) at Vietnam banks include USD / EUR / HKD / JPY, etc. But a warning about Chinese Yuans (RMB or CNY): for some strange reason Vietnam banks (at least all the ones in Hanoi) do NOT exchange Chinese currency. *If you need to change RMB into VDN, go to the gold shops @ 'Ha Trung' road (as explained above).

<p>ATMs are everywhere and cash is king here. The most common transaction limit at the vast majority of ATMs is 2-3,000,000 dong. A few notable ones allow larger withdrawals. Be sure to check the fee they charge. The Techcombank SE of the Hoa Lo Prison allows transactions of at least 7 million dong (these statements may be outdated). In the Old Quarter, Techcombank, Vietcombank, DongA, etc etc all have limits of 2,000,000 - 3,000,000 dong with the majority sitting at the paltry 2,000,000 dong limit. The notable exceptions are ANZ, HSBC, and CitiBank; the ANZ on the western shore of the Hoan Kiem Lake allows up to 5,000,000 dong (updated June 2014), all HSBC ATMs around the city have a limit of 5,600,000 dong (June 2014), and Citibank (there is an ATM on the north side of Hoan Kien Lake for example) leads with a 8,000,000 limit (July 2014). 
</p><p>Check exchange rates daily. Jewelery shops will consistently offer a better rate than banks or hotels.
</p><p>If you arrive in to Noi Bai Airport without any Vietnamese dong be careful about using the ATMs in the airport arrivals area. The BIDV ATM charges a 99,000 dong fee (as of Jan15) for a withdrawal (max 3m dong withdrawal) but doesn't notify you of this charge until the end when the transaction has completed. It might be wise to bring sufficient dong for your taxi/bus ride in to Hanoi in advance and then use one of the other ATMs (as mentioned above) with lower fees.

<p>Vietnamese cuisine is very diverse and most delicious. Most famous remains 'Pho Ga' (chicken noodle soup) or 'Pho Bo'(Beef noodle soup). There are various dishes including chicken, beef, fish and seafood, and there are hundreds, if not thousands, of restaurants nowadays in Hanoi catering to everyone's taste. Hanoi street food become a cuisine culture of Hanoi.
</p><p>In Hanoi, there are thousands of street stalls in small kiosks on the sidewalk, with plastic tables and chairs on the pavement. Grabbing a bite at these eateries is a great way to experience the local food and culture. It is worth mentioning that food quality, freshness, and hygiene can vary greatly. A bowl of noodle soup goes for as little as 30,000 dong. Market food stalls also offer an assortment of other snacks: fruit portions, sausages, donuts, and other eats for 10,000 to 20,000 dong (Jan 2011, 0.5-1 USD). Be sure to get your change as a few vendors seem to 'forget' to return it to you, and learn a little Vietnamese because vendors often speak little to no English.
</p><p>The rule of thumb is if the price is expensive, hygiene quality may or may not be OK, but if the price is cheap, definitely hygiene quality is compromised. There seemed to be no regular food Health Department inspector working regularly in the city. 
</p><p>Another rule of thumb is that Vietnamese have no qualms charging double or more for tourists, as prices are seldom listed on stalls or within shops. Either learn to speak Vietnamese or prepare to pay up to 70,000 dong for that bowl of <i>pho</i> which locals next to you are paying 35,000 dong (as of June 2016).
</p><p>To know which restaurants and dishes are highly rated by locals, try downloading popular food apps among locals such as MenuX, Foody, or Lozi on app stores. They are available in English and work with both Android &amp; iOS.
</p><p>For groceries, there is a large supermarket east of Hoan Kiem Lake (Fivimart, 27A Ly Thai To, at Tran Nguyen Han).
</p><p>The suburb of Le Mat (aka the Snake Village) has numerous restaurants specializing in <b>cobra foodstuffs.</b> Live cobras are stored on the premises much the same way one would find live lobsters at a Western seafood restaurant. If one orders cobra blood wine from the menu, the waiter will take a live cobra, kill it on the spot, drain the blood into a shot glass of rice wine, and top it off with the cobra's still beating heart for you to gulp down! Le Mat is about ten minutes across the river from downtown, take bus 10, 15 or 17 and get off at the large "mega-mall" just beyond Gia Lam station, and walk 500 metres down the road at the right of the mall. Cobras are not cheap at around 400,000-1,000,000 dong (USD$50-) but it gets turned into a dozen unique dishes, enough to share between three or four people.
</p><p>A local delicacy in the Hanoi area is <b>dog meat</b> (<i>thịt chó</i>), which is especially popular in the winter. There are a number of restaurants in the Tay Ho district. Another exotic regional taste is <i>ca cuong</i>, an extract from the <i>belostomatid</i>, or <b>giant water bug</b>. Just a few drops are added to noodles for the unique aroma.
</p><p>Be sure to check out the boiled duck fetus eggs (same as the filipino balut) sold by peddlers almost everywhere priced at 5,000 dong. This delightful experience consists of the vendor cracking the egg in front of you, and peeling the shell and dropping the contents in a plastic micro bowl, then garnished with juliened ginger, basil leaf, and sprinkled with chili sauce. You can see the severed head and beak of your chick that fell off if you are lucky enough to have your first bite from a different spot - Bon Appetit!

<p><a href="/en/Vietnam#Beer" title="Vietnam">Bia Hơi</a> is abundant in the streets of the Old Quarter. At the crossing of <i>Ta Hien</i> and <i>Luong Ngoc Quyen</i> five separate venues fill up with travellers in the evenings, but you can get more local atmosphere on some of the side streets.
</p><p>Hanoi is a lively city on the weekends, but the Old Quarter closes relatively early (at midnight) on weekdays, so you might want to start your night early. Other places outside the Old Quarter stay open later and vary in closing times.
</p><p>Local young people gather around the cathedral located in Ly Quoc Su to have lemon ice tea (Tra Chanh) and sunflower seeds in street bars. After dark it gets quite crowded. Tra Chanh: 8,000 to 10,000 dong.
</p><p>Sit on a plastic chair in front of one of the Bia Hoi (fresh beer) establishments which are invariably situated on the corners of many of Hanoi's 'Old Quarter' streets. This preservative-free light beer is the perfect drink to sip as you watch the city's frenetic life bustle by. The beer costs typically 5,000 dong and gives you an excuse to relax and take photos of the passing local characters. Should not be missed. Moreover, once you reach the Old Quarter, you will find that almost every corner is filled with stalls selling Pho (Vietnamese noodle) and cafe (the name is not limited only to coffee, but also tea, sweets and grocery items, and yes, even to Pho!).
</p><p>On <i>T&#244; Tich</i>, a small street connecting <i>Hang Quat</i> and <i>Hang Gai</i>, you can help yourself to a refreshing fruit milkshake (<i>sinh tố</i>) at one of the stalls (~7000 dong).

<p>Many people plan to move to Hanoi for a year to relax before "settling down". This plan often falls apart at the job phase. Many people will find it difficult to get a job relevant to their interests, especially if they do not speak Vietnamese. However, hostels and hotels in Hanoi may need bar staff, night porters, and the like who speak English and other languages. There are also specialist websites for English and non-Vietnamese speakers looking to work in Hanoi and they are a often a good place to start.
</p><p>One of the most common and popular jobs in Hanoi is becoming an English teacher. There is a mix of private and public schools, as well as informal at home classrooms. Some of these institutions will provide a working visa, but most will not. Keep in mind that it is illegal to work on a tourist visa.
</p><p>There are many flexible office companies in Hanoi that enable you to rent office space for a short term or a long term.
</p><p>Hanoi also has several excellent coworking spaces offering workspace, community events and great wifi. <b>Hub.it</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hubitasia.com">[10]</a> is popular with  entrepreneurs and hosts a regular calendar of tech and startup events. <b>ClickSpace Coworking Villa</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://clickspace.vn/">[11]</a>, located on an atmospheric lane outside the city center, and <b>Spacebar Coworking Cafe</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://clickspace.vn/spacebar/">[12]</a> attract a diverse array of digital nomads and freelancing expats.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Party">Party</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Hanoi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=52" title="Edit section: Party">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The above section on bars is mainly for those who just want to drink quietly by themselves and is entirely irrelevant to those who interpret "bars" as "where can I go to have a lively atmosphere or meet people or party?". Many of the listed bars are largely empty even during peak hours and are for people who want to have a quiet drink alone or with a small group of friends. Some of them may not even exist anymore. On the bright side, if you are interested in mingling or partying in Hanoi, this section addresses your needs.
</p><p>Please keep in mind that, due to city ordinances, all eating and drinking establishments are required to shut down at midnight and it is strictly enforced every day of the week. Parties wind up at 8pm and wind down shortly after the required shut down.
</p><p>Beer Street - Ta Hien Street is the central heart of the party district in Hanoi. By 9pm the sidewalks are filled with the party going crowd drinking and eating outdoors at the local establishments. This is generally a good starting base if you are looking to party. Local bars pack the street and are largely irrelevant to know by name before arriving, as they are all packed in such close proximity on Ta Hien street that it is more sensible to simply go and choose a venue of your preference once you arrive.
</p><p>Downtown Central Backpackers Hostel - Those who have traveled Vietnam are probably familiar with the reputation of "Central Backpackers" Hostel as a wildly popular and successful hostel brand that attracts and caters to young foreign travelers who want to mingle during the day and party really hard at night. So much so that this hostel hosts very packed parties in its lobby/bar area every evening (even in off season) and is probably the single most popular backpacker venue during the evening. This is also a good place to start your night if this type of crowd appeals to you (read: zero Vietnamese people, 100% loud, drunk, happy foreigners).
</p><p>In the area between Ta Hien and Downtown Central Packpackers are four major bars/clubs that are ultimately the destination of anyone who isn't at the above locations. They are patronized by varying mixes of locals versus foreigners. Temple is filled with foreigners. Hair of the Dog's 1st floor is saturated with locals while foreigners usually fill up the 2nd floor. Dragonfly is mainly locals. Rockhouse is often an even mix of both.
</p><p>After the police shut down all establishments, the only venues left for foreigners to go to are Lighthouse and Tom's Bar, which are both open very late into the night. Lighthouse is a 15-20 minute walk from said establishments and is located east, across the highway. Tom's Bar at 2 Ta Hien street, and has its metal shutters down to prevent police from charging them with breaking the law, but has workers outside who will open the shutters to let you in (easily spotted from their earpieces and walkie talkies that allow them to coordinate the opening and closing of the shutters as enforcing police patrol the area) -- it is actually quite an experience to go in, as it is ultimately harmless (the bar is the only one violating laws and the police could care less about its patrons) but a fun experience to try out. There is no cover charge for either bar.
</p><p>As a final note, there are actually the existence of proper large scale clubs, replete with complex sound systems, light shows, famous Vietnamese DJ's, and large venues where young people get dressed up and party late into the night. However, they are almost complete filled with locals and center around the reservation of tables with expensive alcohol bottles. Because of the focus on tables, the opportunity to mingle or meet people is much less than clubs elsewhere in the world, though there is a requisite bar area at most places where people who haven't booked tables hang out (read: single men) and can order drinks one at a time. Drinks can be expensive. However, the DJ's can be incredibly high quality and foreign DJ's are also known to be brought in to host events. The most popular clubs are The Bank, Lift, Infinity, and Rooftop, and all can be found through Google searches and are located roughly south of the Lake.

Be aware information about a hotel from a tout may in fact be different from what the hotel offers, their policy, etc. If ever in doubt, speak with a direct staff member of the hotel.
</p><p>It may be wise to verify the conditions of "free" products the hotel may offer or even go as far to take pictures of the room or mini bar should proof ever be needed. If ever unsure whether something is complimentary or not, check before partaking of the product or service.
</p><p>If during your stay a hotel finds a reason to move you to a different hotel, insist they provide proof their claims are legitimate and if they are asking you move to a higher-priced hotel, make sure they have an agreement with the new hotel to pay the difference in price or other arrangements which all parties find suitable.
</p><p>If at any point during your stay you decide to keep your valuables in a safe box with the hotel administration avoid giving them your credit cards. The hotel owners have been known to use the credit card information to book rooms at their hotels with your cards after your departure.

<p>The Old Quarter is littered with guesthouses and hostels catering for budget travellers. A venue down an alley will not have the constant traffic noise, but check for construction work happening next door, it can wake you up just as early. If you leave food in your room keep it covered/sealed; poor hygiene in the neighbourhood can bring rodents through the smallest of holes in search of sustenance.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stay_safe">Stay safe</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Hanoi&amp;action=edit&amp;section=57" title="Edit section: Stay safe">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Compared to other cities in the developing world, Hanoi is reasonably safe, especially for tourists and expats. It is also much safer than <a href="/en/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, where violent crime, murder and pick-pocketing are far more widespread. The most important danger to watch out for is avoiding traffic while crossing the street as car and motorbike traffic saturate most tourist areas of Hanoi.
</p><p>Violent crime is highly uncommon. Petty crime does happen on occasion, and usually takes the form of thievery of your valuables while in public or while in transit. Being attentive of your surroundings and valuables and using common sense should keep you safe and happy.
</p><p>As an aside, while not a physical crime, the common "crime" experienced is paying more for goods and services than locals do, sometimes by double the price or more. This generally happens when paying for food, transport, hotels, and useful information about this can be found on the <a href="/en/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> page. 
</p><p>Like everywhere else in Vietnam, traffic in Hanoi is dominated by an incredible number of motorbikes, all of which seem to be making a mad, desperate dash for something just out of reach — all of the time. All the while blowing their horns incessantly. In other words, pedestrian traffic can be overwhelming for visitors, especially in the narrow streets around the Old Quarter. When you leave the curb, look not only both ways but left, right, back and front, and take each step slowly and patiently allowing them to pass because even an eye contact is not enough with the oncoming drivers and actually before you know it, someone is also on your back since there is no such thing as one-directional traffic in Vietnam. The key word here is <b>slowly</b> — don't rush. This way the drivers are aware of you, and can take you into account (along with all of the other motorbikes). It may look, and indeed is somewhat chaotic, but be patient and pay attention when you're crossing any street, large or small, and you should be fine. Definitely, the streets of Hanoi has no place for faint hearted people, with hypertension and heart problems on top of the disabled and the old. You should look everywhere as you proceed. Holding out your arm toward the stream of vehicles as a "slow down, I am crossing" sign may be a good idea but not acknowledged most of the time. Don't stop suddenly when you see one coming a little fast or rush your steps when you are crossing. Just even your pace and walk slowly. The motorbikes will find their way to avoid you themselves.
</p><p>If you are exploring Hanoi on a motorbike be extremely cautious when going past stationary Taxis, expect the unexpected, like a taxi door suddenly flinging open.
</p><p>Pickpockets are well organized and very fast. They may operate in groups, so please be vigilant in crowded areas. Thieves on motorbikes are known to snatch bags from cafe tables or phones out of the hands of pedestrians. Keep all eyes on your belongings, especially in crowded area like Dong Xuan night market; expect female pickpockets and don't let them surround you. If you carry a backpack or rucksack, do NOT carry it on your back especially in crowded areas with high tourist traffic eg Hoan Kiem Lake area. Pick pockets will open your bag behind you and help themselves to your belongings. Carry it in front of you instead. 
</p><p>There is a dual price policy at food establishments: tourists usually pay more than locals. Be diligent about knowing the price for a meal before you order, or you may end up with a surprising bill. See the <a href="/en/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> page for additional advice on how to avoid paying excessive amounts on your food bill.
</p><p>Be vigilant when taking a taxi, if you have bags in the trunk, make sure he does not drive off with your bags. Ask your hotel which taxi companies are reliable - dishonest taxis are equipped with meters that run at an adjusted (much faster) rate. As of June 2014, Hanoi Group Taxi and Mai Linh are generally the two most reputable companies, though even then, dishonesty may occasionally surface from driver to driver.
</p><p>Always ask the price first, and give the hawkers and taxi drivers exact change if possible. Mobile hawkers (carrying food hung on poles across their shoulders) have been known to pocket the (significant) change and stuff more food than you had intended to buy into your hands, and than quickly take off, leaving the bewildered tourist in the dust. The same is true of taxi and Xe Om drivers. Do not allow anyone to sit in the back of you on a motorbike. If this happens, disembark immediately. The person behind you may try to steal from you.
</p><p>As in many Southeast Asian cities, Hanoi is hygienically challenged especially where locals congregate more to dine. Expect that there may be a non-existing Health Department, or this is not in the priority of the city government.
</p><p>Hotel staff members may try to pick padlocks on travelers bags, fake mechanics throw nails at tourists on motorbikes to cause flat tires and the police, probably the worst crooks of them all, are known to steal from people (both locals and tourists) and ask for a bribe to get the items back.

<p>4G internet is very cheap and readily available everywhere in Hanoi. Buying a SIM card costs between 45 000 and 55 000 dong. Unlimited internet for a month costs 40 000 Dong on Viettel (as of June 2013, rates for unlimited 4G on Viettel and the other major telco have just been raised to 50 000).
</p><p>Do not buy a SIM card at the Vinaphone counter at the Hanoi airport. The lady at the counter will tell you that unlimited internet for a month costs 500 000 dong, SIM card included. She will give you a SIM card, won't set it up correctly, give you no credit and pocket the 500 000 dong. Also, be aware that she writes fake invoices.

<p>There are plenty of internet cafés all over the city. Most are used by Vietnamese teens playing online dance or battle games. Rates vary, but can be as low as 3,000 dong/hr. Some of the better cafés, particularly in the Old Quarter, have computers that are Skype-capable for international phone calls. Close to Hanoi Youth Hostel there is a cybercafe that charge tourist ten times the actual cost. It is next door, and has no name. If you are not in a hurry use another one.
</p><p>The cafes that charge you for using the Internet usually provide desktop computers. There are also cafes where they have free wireless. All you have to do is order something from their menus and use their wifi for as long as you want. The wifi cafes are usually concentrated around Hoan Kiem lake area.
</p><p>There are restaurants and cafes with W-Fi hotspots everywhere in the city.  Most restaurants and cafes that offer Wi-Fi readily advertise their Wi-Fi password.

<p>Please note before you arrive in Hanoi (or Vietnam in general) that ATM's are notorious for having low limits. Most ATM withdrawal amounts max out at 2,000,000-5,000,000 dong per withdrawal, which may be a concern if your bank charges an international withdrawal fee. While this is not necessarily a concern except for those travelers who are on a budget, please consider this and plan accordingly before arriving in Hanoi. Some strategies include bringing cash (like Thai Baht or USD) to use at money exchangers thus avoiding ATM fees, or to open an account with a bank that either has with no international transaction fees or has a branch in Hanoi (such as HSBC or ANZ).

<p>Extending your stay in Vietnam can be done with relative ease in Hanoi. The cost will vary depending on your country of origin as well as your visa type (1 month single entry vs multiple entry vs 3 month entry etc). The most common way to extend your visa is to have an intermediary broker the transaction rather than going directly to the Immigration office to do the paperwork yourself. Every hostel, hotel, and trip agency is able to do this for you, at widely varying prices, so you should definitely ask for the cost at two or three different places to ensure you're not getting ripped off (getting a quote takes about a minute, as asking for visa extensions is a rather common request at most places). As a point of reference, a one month single-entry visa for a US citizen was quoted in June 2014 at prices ranging from $32 to $50 for an additional month extension (you can extend up to 3 months at a time, but the cost for it in the said situation ranged from $140 to $150 so it may be best to request extensions month by month), with a 4 day processing time (excluding weekends). You relinquish your passport to the broker. Please remember to get a receipt. The extension adds 30 days on top of the expiration of your original visa. For what it is worth, Hanoi City Hostel on 95 Hang Ga street did the job flawlessly for US passports for $32 (July 2014).

<p>If you are the adventurous type or simply bored temporarily of the city atmosphere, then consider a cruise in the northern countryside. A round trip will bring you to a lot of charming villages and through hills and valleys with stunning nature. Main roads are generally in good condition and you can easily do a couple of hundred kilometers a day. The villages and provinces are generally safe at night, and you get to see a lot of Vietnamese culture such as various tribe folks. While bus services are in fact available (albeit not always reliable), a recommended alternative is to rent a bike or car and make the trip on your own. Motorbikes in decent quality can be rented for as little as US$5 a day, and many places have suggestions for routes.
</p>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Ha_Long_Bay" title="Ha Long Bay">Ha Long Bay</a>'s spectacular ocean karst topography is the most popular side-trip from Hanoi. A 2 day, 1 night Ha Long Bay cruise could be bargained down to USD45 at travel agencies. If contacting directly to the guide (on the pier in <a href="/en/Halong" title="Halong">Halong</a> city or when the bus comes to pick up tourists) price could be USD40 or less. This price includes transportation, accommodation, all tickets and entrance fees, kayaking and food. Ask all the options to be written on your receipt and take foto of your receipt, since guide will collect it. Guide will try to scam you - ask to buy admission ticket, pay for kayaking, etc... Food is very limited on the boat, so it might be good idea to book tour without food (USD10 less) and bring your own. Drinks (even water) are not included and are quite expensive on the boat-50,000 dong, while on the mainland shops 5,000-10,000 dong. Furthermore some cruise charge 10,000 dong/bottom the guests who take their own soft drink or water  and 300,000 dong for alcohol drink. Boats and cabins are ok (it is well-controlled industry). There are hundreds of cruise boats leaving everyday, most are quite similar. People who pay more, for 'deluxe' cruise often are being send on the same tour with who pays minimum price.  All cabins on the same boat are nearly same, just specify in advance whether you need twin or double. Be careful in kayaking, they might give you half-broken paddles, but if it finally breaks completely, they will charge you. Beware some guild cut some program to see only 1 cave instead 2 caves.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The <a href="/en/Sapa" title="Sapa">Sapa</a> mountain region, home to ethnic minorities, gorgeous mountain scenery, and trekking paths connecting many tiny mountain villages is the second most popular trip. It is accessible by bus or train to <a href="/en/Lao_Cai" title="Lao Cai">Lao Cai</a>, then onward by minibus or hired motorbike. Sleeper bus 11-15$.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Ha_Giang" title="Ha Giang">Ha Giang</a> is also a mountainous area with even more impressive landscape than Sapa. There aren't many tours to Ha Giang, so most travelers have to figure out their own ways. But once you get to Ha Giang, you can rent a scooter and have one of the most amazing rides among mountains, valleys and escalated rice fields. Ha Giang gets a lot more popular among backpackers in the last few years, so you will most likely find young European tourists on the way. Buses are available from My Dinh bus station.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Perfume_Pagoda"><span class="fn org">Perfume Pagoda</span>,  (<span class="note directions">Not reasonably reachable by public transport. Tours are available anywhere in Hanoi.</span>), <a class="url external autonumber" href="http://www.perfumepagodatours.com" rel="nofollow">[x]</a>. <span class="description">An ancient Buddhist pilgrimage site about 60km southwest of Hanoi. A full-day excursion <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.perfumepagodatours.com/hanoi-tours/27-perfume-pagoda-day-trip.html">[1]</a>  that involves a boat trip to the main site, where you will hike (30-45min) or take a cable car up a mountain 90,000 dong/1 way,170,000 dong/round trip. Some travel companies are known to promise a trip up, but only provide a trip down. This saves the travel company money. Make sure to ensure if your ticket is for up or down. Some tour include cable car in the program some is an addition the customers buy after, so before decide to buy the tour should ask the agent include cable car or not. Near the top is a large limestone cave containing Buddhist shrines and statues. There are various other temples and grottoes along the way. The boat trip may include a hidden "tip" not covered by the company you book with. Additionally, the boatkeeper might pickpocket you. The boatkeeper might pickpocket you, and still demand a tip after being caught pickpocketing. The boatkeeper and tour guide might use the local police to intimidate you into paying for the luxury of being pickpocketed, along with a tip and thank you to the police and tour guide.</span> <span class="price">Tour from USD15 including transport, lunch, and admission</span>. </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Bat_Trang" title="Bat Trang">Bat Trang</a>, a village world-famous for its pottery, 9km southeast of Hanoi. It is accessible by taking Bus 47, which originates at Long Bien. Just hop on (the bus will be clearly labelled with the number 47 and the text "Long Bien - Bat Trang"; bus fare is 5,000 dong one-way as of Dec 2013) and take it to the last stop, which is directly opposite the pottery market (haggle for lower prices, and insist on paying in Dong). Head back up the street to the factories to see artists at work.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Cao_Bang" title="Cao Bang">Cao Bang</a>, featuring the beautiful Ban Gioc waterfall, is five hours away by bus, near the Chinese border.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The <a href="/en/Cuc_Phuong_National_Park" title="Cuc Phuong National Park">Cuc Phuong National Park</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.cucphuongnationalpark.com">the largest national park in Vietnam</a> and an easy day-trip from Hanoi,</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Co_Loa" title="Co Loa">Co Loa</a> is the oldest ancient capital in the region; a little visited site slightly northeast of Hanoi.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Tam Coc/Hoa Lu: Located in <a href="/en/Ninh_Binh" title="Ninh Binh">Ninh Binh</a> province, this day trip is a combines heritage tourism and natural landscape tourism. Hoa Lu is the site of the first capital of Vietnam in the 10th century, and was home to two kings-- Dinh Bo Linh (Dinh Tien Hoang) and Le Hoan-- there are now two shrines dedicated to these two kings. About 30 min away from Hoa Lu is Tam Coc [three grottoes]-- also known as Halong Bay on land. It features karst landforms surrounded by paddy fields, and is accessed by little wooden boats. Boats, with a boatman, are for hire at USD3.50/trip, 2 passengers to a boat, which takes about one hour. Obviously, the front seat is the better seat. This is an excellent alternative to Halong Bay for those who have short attention spans, as the boat trip takes a mere hour versus Halong Bay tourist boats which take 5 hours. One minor annoyance involves pedlars on boats hawking their wares, and your boat rower trying to sell you embroidery. This is especially trying at the halfway point when the boats are about to turn around for the return trip. A large number of hawkers on boats will be waiting at that point and will attempt to pressure the passengers to buy souvenirs or snacks, while your boatman makes no attempt to move away. Either buy a small item/snack/drink, or politely but firmly turn them down. They'll generally give up after a few uncomfortable minutes. After boat trip,there is bicycle trip around the village, but some tour agency tactic do not write in the receipt so the customer have to pay addition for rental bicycle 60,000 dong. Trip can be booked in Hanoi for about USD18-20.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Laos" title="Laos">Laos</a>: You can go to <a href="/en/Luang_Prabang" title="Luang Prabang">Luang Prabang</a> for 42$ but this trip is know as a "nightmare bus". Alternatively you can go to <a href="/en/Dien_Bien_Phu" title="Dien Bien Phu">Dien Bien Phu</a> then take a local bus to <a href="/en/Muang_Khua" title="Muang Khua">Muang Khua</a>, switch to river boat to <a href="/en/Muang_Ngoi" class="mw-redirect" title="Muang Ngoi">Muang Ngoi</a> and <a href="/en/Nong_Khiaw" title="Nong Khiaw">Nong Khiaw</a> from where minivans go to <a href="/en/Luang_Prabang" title="Luang Prabang">Luang Prabang</a> - that in total will give you the same price but much pleasant trip and opportunity to see and sleep in beautiful Laotian small towns and villages.</li></ul>
<p>Beware: almost hotel, hostel or guest house in Hanoi sell tours and there are many tour agent counters around the city, especially Shinh Cafe. But the rate of the same tour, same agent is very different. So before decide to buy the tour, the tourist have to check several counters compare the price, don't forget to ask what include,what exclude (VAT-Value Add Tax, assurance, bus, guide, meal, entrance fee, boat, bicycle, etc.) avoid to buy too expensive tour or pay more after.
