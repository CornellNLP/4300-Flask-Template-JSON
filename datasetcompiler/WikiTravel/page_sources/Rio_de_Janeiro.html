<p><b>Rio de Janeiro</b> is the second largest city in Brazil, on the South Atlantic coast. Rio is famous for its breathtaking landscape, its laid back beach culture and its annual carnival. Although, their soccer skills here are very well recognized.
</p><p>The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is comprised of a unique entry from the ocean that makes it appear to be the mouth of a river.  Additionally, the harbor is surrounded by spectacular geographic features including Sugar Loaf mountain at 395 meters (1,296 feet), Corcovado Peak at 704 meters (2,310 feet), and the hills of Tijuca at 1,021 meters (3,350 feet).  These features work together to collectively make the harbor one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://sevennaturalwonders.org/">[2]</a>).

<p>It is a common mistake to think of <b>Rio</b> as <a href="/en/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>'s capital, a distinction it lost on 21 April 1960 when newly built <a href="/en/Brasilia" title="Brasilia">Brasilia</a> became the capital. Beaches such as <b>Copacabana</b> and <b>Ipanema</b>, the <b>Christ The Redeemer</b> (<i>Cristo Redentor</i>) statue, the stadium of <b>Maracan&#227;</b> and <b>Sugar Loaf Mountain</b> (<i>Pão de Açúcar</i>) are all well-known sights of what the inhabitants call the "marvelous city" (<i>cidade maravilhosa</i>), and are also among the first images to pop up in travelers´ minds, along with the <b>Carnaval</b> celebration.
</p><p>Sadly, most people also know Rio for its violence and crime. The drug lords and the slums, or <b>favelas</b>, are the tip of very old social problems. The favelas are areas of poor-quality housing, slums usually located on the city's many mountain slopes, juxtaposed with middle-class neighborhoods. The South Zone holds most of Rio's landmarks and world-famous beaches, in an area of only 43.87 square km (17 mi²). Many of them are within walking distance of each other (for instance, the Sugar Loaf lies about 8 km/5 mi from Copacabana beach). Most hotels and hostels are located in this part of the city, which is compressed between the Tijuca Range (<i>Maciço da Tijuca</i>) and the sea. There are important places in other regions as well, such as Maracanã stadium in the North Zone and the many fascinating buildings in the Centre.
</p><p>If you plan on staying in Rio for more than a couple of days it would be good to invest in a copy of ``How to be a Carioca``(Priscilla Ann Goslin, Livros TwoCan Ltda, R$32). This is an amusing look at the people of Rio and will help you enjoy the city as well as appear less of a `gringo` when you hit the streets.

<p>Rio was founded in 1565 by the Portuguese as a fortification against French privateers who trafficked wood and goods from Brazil. Piracy played a major role in the city's history, and there are still colonial fortresses to be visited (check below). The Portuguese fought the French for nearly 10 years, both sides having rival native tribes as allies. 
</p><p>For the next two centuries it was an unimportant outpost of the Portuguese Empire, until gold, diamonds, and ore were found in <a href="/en/Minas_Gerais" title="Minas Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> in 1720. Then, as the nearest port, Rio became the port for these minerals and replaced <a href="/en/Salvador" title="Salvador">Salvador</a> as the main city in the colony in 1763.
</p><p>When Napoleon invaded Portugal, the Royal Family moved to Brazil and made Rio capital of the Kingdom (so it was the only city outside Europe to be capital of a European country). 
</p><p>When Brazil became independent in 1822, it adopted Monarchy as its form of government (with Emperors Pedro I and Pedro II). Many historians and Brazilians from other places say <i>cariocas</i> are nostalgic of the Royal and Imperial times, which is reflected in many place names and shop names. 
</p><p>In 2009, the city won their bid to host the games of the XXXI Olympics in the summer of 2016. This was the fifth bid by the city, whose 1936, 1940, 2004 and 2012 bids lost.

</p><p>To leave the aiport, there are five options: <b>common buses</b>, <b>Premium buses</b>, the <b>BRT Transcarioca buses</b>, <b>taxis</b> or some kind of <b>transfer</b>.

<p>The Premium buses are four bus lines operated by <i>Real</i> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.realautoonibus.com.br/Site/NossasLinhas-Premium-00,undefined,REAL84866120120119115236-71.html">[4]</a>,that depart from right outside the arrival section of <i>Galeão</i>. The buses are air-conditioned and comfy, with ample luggage space. They run roughly every 30 minutes from 05:30 to 22:00.
</p>
<ul><li><b>2018 Aeroporto Internacional do RJ/Alvorada (Via Orla da Zona Sul)</b> runs from Galeão via the main bus terminal <i>Rodoviario Novo Rio</i>, the <i>Carioca metro station</i> and <i>Santos Dumont Airport</i> further along the beachfront of <i>Botafogo</i>, <i>Copacabana</i>, <i>Ipanema</i> and <i>Leblon</i>, and has its terminus at the <i>Alvorada</i> terminal near <i>Barra Shopping</i> in <i>Barra da Tijuca</i>. The full run takes at least 60 minutes, often double that. Tickets are R$ 16.00 (June 2016).</li>
<li><b>2918 Aeroporto Internacional do RJ/Alvorada (Via Linha Amarela)</b> runs from <i>Galeão</i> airport along the <i>Linha Amarela</i> to the <i>Alvorada</i> bus terminal, via <i>Jacarapaguá</i> (the best spot for taxis) in as little as 35 minutes, traffic allowing. R$ 13.50 (May 2014).</li>
<li><b>2145 Aeroporto Internacional do RJ/Aeroporto Santos Dumont (Via Seletiva da Av. Brasil/Av. Pres. Vargas)</b> runs from Galeão via the main bus terminal Rodoviario Novo Rio to Santos Dumont Airport. Tickets are R$ 12 (May 2014).</li>
<li><b>2101 Aeroporto Internacional do RJ/Aeroporto Santos Dumont (Via Linha Vermelha e Perimetral)</b>, same as above, along a slightly different route.</li></ul>
<p>There are luggage storage area on all the above Express, A/C buses. Fare will be displayed on the front of the bus and is paid to the driver. Ensure you have change; they don't like changing anything above R$20! Along the bus' route you can get off wherever you ask. For the trip from the city to the airport, the buses can be boarded in front of the major hotels or simply flagged down along their route (wave vividly).

<p>The BRT system <i>Transcarioca</i>, also called <i>Expresso Alvorado-Galeão</i> is a 24/7 service of fast buses on segregated lanes, inaugurated in June of 2014. The buses have AC and space for luggage and go <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.brtrio.com/estacoes">[5]</a> from both Galeão terminals (arrivals level) with just two intermediate stops at <i>Vicente de Carvalho</i> (connection to Metrô) and <i>Madureira</i> to the large <i>Alvorada Bus Terminal</i> in the neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca, 18 km west of Leblon. 
To enter the bus is necessary to have a <b>RioCard</b>, a rechargeable card that gives access to all means of transport of the city. You can buy one at the ATMs present at the BRT station or inside the Airport Terminal.
To learn more about buying and recharging RioCard, check out their <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.cartaoriocard.com.br">official site</a>.

<p>The cheapest reliable taxi option is Uber using the same app as in other countries and Internet connection, for example airport wi-fi to request a ride. The trip to the center costs around R$ 40-50 and R$ 45-60 to Copacobana or Ipanema (2019). Uber pickups are done on the departures floor (at Terminals 1 and 2). Do not exit from the arrivals floor, but head upstairs to departures and meet your driver at the pickup point you selected. There are even Uber signs at some departure terminal entrances. There are usually several Uber drivers already waiting there.
</p><p>The taxi trip into the city centre is rather long and some taxi drivers try to take advantage of foreign tourists that are not familiar with the pricing and options of the local transportation. Scams happen more often outbound to the City and during high tourism periods such as New Years and Carnaval (mid to late February).
Options from the airport include both yellow taxis and radio taxis. 
</p><p>If you are keen to use a radio taxi (prices as of Nov 13: Galeão - Copacabana/Ipanema/Leblon R$99, haggling possible), it is advisable to organize them through the attendants at one of the booths which you will come across immediately upon exiting the customs clearance area. When you walk outside, a wide variety of people will begin aggressively offering taxi services. It's best to decline all offers along the way and walk towards the street, where taxis are lined up along the entire stretch usually grouped together with their own service. Most of the taxis are radio taxis (various colors) but there is usually also a queue of yellow taxis. At this point, you can select which option or service you prefer and walk up to them to take the next in line. During busy times, there may be a queue at these points to wait in.
</p><p>If you want to take a Yellow cab and want to avoid the touts and scammers, do not exit from the first floor (arrivals), but go down to the departures floor ("embarque"). When you walk outside there, ignore the parked taxi drivers yelling, “TAXI, TAXI, TAXI” as they often charge double the regular metered price. Turn to one side and walk some 30 meters on the sidewalk to get away from them. On the street in front of you there will be many of the standard yellow taxis dropping off passengers at the airport, or driving slowly and looking for a passenger. It’s easy to flag them down because they’re looking for you, hoping they can get a fare to go back to Zona Sul instead of going back with an empty taxi. You’re helping them out, and they tend to be of the happier, non-airport dwelling variety of taxi driver. Prices by meter (as of 2014) go as R$ 58 to Ipanema (26 min), R$ 63 to Copacabana (28 min), R$ 68 to Jardim Botanico (31 min), but may go up by R$10 or more if you get stuck in a traffic jam. From Monday to Friday from 07:00 until midday there is often traffic congestion in the lanes from the airport to the city center so that rides leaving the Galeão airport should be expected to last at least over one hour, sometimes well over. Consider using Google Maps to check the expected traffic by the time you will be leaving the airport.

<p>A cab is one of the best ways to move around Rio. However, be aware that traffic jams in Rio can be terrible at times. For instance, a taxi ride from Ipanema to the bus terminal Rodoviária Novo Rio normally takes something like 25 minutes, but if you get seriously stuck, it may take 90 minutes instead. Therefore, make sure you have a time margin in case you really can´t afford to be late.
Rio taxis are not too expensive on a kilometer basis, especially, if you can share the cost among your party - a cab can usually hold up to four passengers. That said, beware however, that distances can be quite considerable. E.g., a journey from Zona Sul to the Centro is around R$35 and takes approx. 16 min; from the International Airport to Copacabana it's around R$44 / 28 minutes.
</p><p>Rio's taxis come in different flavours:
</p>
<ul><li>Yellow taxis</li>
<li>Special service cars</li>
<li>Radio taxis</li>
<li>Uber</li>
<li>Illegal taxis</li></ul>
<p><b>Yellow taxis</b> are yellow with a blue stripe painted on the sides. In Rio, they are in great supply and are available to wave down at any time of the day or night in the primary tourist and business areas of the city. Throughout the city, there are numerous taxi stands where taxis queue to await passengers. It is preferable to get a taxi from one of these stands as they are typically a bit more reliable as they are associated to that stand . These taxi stands also exist at or near to most hotels as well. The stands range from a formal service with logos (in other words, part of a cooperative). and contact by phone to just a regular group of "freelance" taxi drivers that have come together to serve the spot.
Yellow taxis possess of meters, but make sure or ask (just say "Taxímetro?") that these are really turned on. Fares consist of a fee for the minimum ride, called <i>bandeirada</i> (R$4.90 as of 2014) and a per kilometer fee: 
</p>
<ul><li>R$2,35 on Sundays and holidays, any day between 21h00-06h00, any time in December (so called "Bandeira 2")</li>
<li>R$1.95 on other times (so called "Bandeira 1")</li></ul>
<p>About once every two years, the rate is raised by the city. When this happens (most recently in March 2014), all taxis will put a rate table on the window to convert the meter total to the updated rate. This is necessary as it generally takes about 9 months or so to get the thousands of taxis re-calibrated.
</p><p><b>Special service cars</b> are private cars without identifying markings nor a light on top. As they are typically associated with hotels, the door man will ask whether you would like to use them and will say that they are safer and more comfortable than a regular yellow taxi off the street. Special service cars do not operate from a taxi meter and the drivers are not regulated or controlled. For a certain journey they can quote whatever price they think is reasonable or that they can get. It is therefore advisable to negotiate (or at least request) the price before starting out. A good deal would usually be about R$5 more than what a yellow taxi would cost by meter.
</p><p><b>Radio taxis</b> are usually blue, green, or white. If you want to avoid being ripped off, which is most likely after arrival at the airport, then it may be worthwhile taking a Radio taxi. These are organized by calling (or your hotel staff calling) one of the about four companies, each serving all of Rio. When calling by phone, the operator indicates a non-negotiable price which does not depend on time of day or heavy traffic, so that passengers need not to worry about being overcharged. Radio taxi services are very reputable, knowledgeable of the city and directions and reliable and have the best/cleanest vehicles. Radio taxis are the safest form of transportation, especially when travelling late at night, or in a less travelled area of town. Due to their high reliability, they are also best option if you need to be picked up at an exact time (especially at night or early morning). On the downside, Radio taxis are also the most expensive form of transportation.
</p><p><b>Uber</b> is the cheapest, safe and very reliable taxi service. You only need to download an app and have an internet connection, for example wi-fi when you request a ride. Uber app is the same as in other countries.
</p><p>Generally, taxi drivers in Rio are quite knowledgeable when locating the usual destinations and hotels. However, it is advisable to write down the address of less familiar destinations on a piece of paper to show the driver before you go. This should include the neighborhood (Bairro) such as Ipanema or Copacana or Centro. This is an especially good idea for those who don't speak the language.
</p><p>You can also ask a cab for a city tour and arrange a fixed price (may be around US$20).
</p><p>For those travelling to Rio for Carnival it's worth using a company that allows you to book and pay in advance, and to try and pay as much in advance as possible as prices tend to increase a few weeks before Carnival.
</p><p>Taxi transport from/to the International Airport (named Tom Jobim or previously Galeao) is a special situation, see above.

<p>Buses are still the cheapest and most convenient way to get around the city due to the high number and frequency of lines running through the area. There are designated bus lanes in most streets that make travel times shorter. For the adventurous or budget traveler, it is worth asking your hotel or hostel employees how to navigate the system or which routes to take to arrive at specific locations. 
</p><p>However, you should be mindful of questionable characters and your belongings. By night buses are more scarce, and most lines will usually not be running by the time the bars and clubs are full. 
Keep an eye out for pickpockets when the bus is crowded, and don't be surprised if your driver goes a little faster and brakes a little more suddenly than you'd like. Except for minibuses, buses now have two doors: passengers get in through the front door and get off through the back (it was otherwise until 2001-2002).
</p><p>Buses cost R$3.95 (Jun 2018) with no distinction for the few buses with air conditioning. You can pay the passage by RioCard (rechargeable card accepted in all ways of transportation) or money. These days, you can get a RioCard easily in several locations (check the closest at www.cartaoriocard.com.br)
</p><p>Some bus stops in the South Zone are equipped with a shelter and a bench, but sometimes, far from tourist areas, they are less obvious and have no signs at all - you might have to ask. As a general rule in most parts of Brazil, buses stop only when you hail them, by extending the arm. If you don't hail and there are no passengers waiting to get off, the bus simply won't stop. The same can be said if you are on the bus wanting to get off at a particular stop. You should know the surroundings or the name of the intersection of the area you are going, or inquire to the employee operating the turnstile, so you can signal to the driver that you want to get off, or he may not stop! Typically bus drivers and controllers won't understand any foreign language. If you can't speak Portuguese at all, use a map. Trying to speak Spanish is usually not helpful.

<p>There are no schedules or timetables. Usually buses run at least every 15 minutes, but it may be just once an hour or more infrequently late at night or in remote areas of town. Google Maps and the Maps app also has the Rio bus system in it, allowing you to plug your location and destination with step-by-step instructions.
</p><p>There are a baffling 1000+ bus lines in Rio (including variants), covering nearly all of the city, operated by about a dozen independent operations. At least 6 of them ply the streets of Copacabana and Ipanema. The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rioonibus.com">[14]</a> website contains a catalog of the lines, but is of little help unless you know the line number or can enter exact street names. The website VaDeOnibus <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vadeonibus.com.br">[15]</a> contains a route planner: you can enter two addresses and it gives you the buslines that go between them, including their time tables. Many lines differ only a few streets from each other in their itineraries, and some even have variants within the same line. Bus lines with a * or a letter means that this bus has a variant. It means that there may be a bus with the same name, same number, same origin, even same destination but with a complete different route. Lines are numbered according to the general route they serve:
</p>
<ul><li>beginning with 1 - South Zone/Downtown</li>
<li>beginning with 2 - North Zone/Downtown</li>
<li>beginning with 3 - West Zone/Downtown</li>
<li>beginning with 4 - North Zone/South Zone</li>
<li>beginning with 5 - within South Zone</li>
<li>beginning with 6 - North Zone/West Zone</li>
<li>beginning with 7 and 9 - within North Zone</li>
<li>beginning with 8 - within West Zone</li></ul>
<p>Since Febuary 2016, Rio's bus system has been under major changes on South Zone. Many lines were extinguished and many others were replaced. Now, beyond the "numbered lines", there are the:
</p><p><i>"Troncal" Lines:</i> These lines connect South Zone with Downtown (Centro), serving Central do Brasil train station and the Intercity Bus Terminal (Rodoviária). The main lines are:
</p>
<ul><li>Troncal 1: Central X General Osorio - attends Copacabana</li>
<li>Troncal 2: Rodoviária X Jardim de Alah -attends Lapa, Botafogo and Copacabana</li>
<li>Troncal 3: Central X Leblon - attends Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon</li>
<li>Troncal 4: Rodoviária X São Conrado - attends Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon</li>
<li>Troncal 5: Central X Gávea - attends Botafogo and the Botanic Garden</li>
<li>Troncal 6: Rodoviária X Leblon -attends Botafogo, Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon</li>
<li>Troncal 7: Central X Cosme Velho - attends Corcovado railway station</li>
<li>Troncal 8: Rodoviária X Cosme Velho - attends Corcovado railway station</li>
<li>Troncal 9: Central X São Conrado - attends Leblon, Botafogo and the Botanic Garden</li>
<li>Troncal 10: Cruz Vermelha X Jardim de Alah - attends Lapa, Botafogo, Leblon and the Botanic Garden</li></ul>
<p><i>"Intregrada" Lines:</i> They consist on six lines linking South Zone with Barra da Tijuca area, leaving from Rio Sul shopping mall, attending Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon beaches, and connecting with the BRT system in Alvorada terminal at Barra. Integrada 2 line (Rio Sul / Alvorada) has the most scenic itinerary, going along the avenues of the oceanic shore.
</p><p><i>"Circular" Lines:</i> These lines have a circular route through all South Zone. Circular 1 (581) and Circular 2 (582) lines make their way to Urca, passing near the lower cable car station up the Sugar Loaf mountain. They also serve Corcovado Railway Station and the Botanic Garden, and are used more often by tourists, despite the price being the same as other lines.

<p>The <b>Metrô Rio</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.metrorio.com.br">[16]</a> is safe, quick, clean, comfortable, air-conditioned and has much better signage than most transport in Rio, making the lives of foreign tourists easier. It operates 
</p>
<ul><li>05:00 to 24:00 mondays to saturdays</li>
<li>07:00 to 23:00 sundays</li>
<li>00:00 to 24:00 during Carnival</li></ul>
<p>There are three lines, Line 1 (Orange), Line 2 (Green) and Line 4 (Yellow). 
</p><p>A one-way subway-only "unitario" ticket is R$4.30. The ticket window will give you a card that you insert in the turnstile; do not pull it out unless you've purchased a multi-trip or transfer pass. Rechargeable IC cards (minimum charge R$5, no deposit required) are also available and definitely worth getting if you'll be in town for a few days.
</p><p>Since 2003, the <i>Metrô</i> company operates bus lines from some metro stations to nearby neighborhoods which are not served by the subway system. This is particularly helpful for places uphill such as Gávea, Laranjeiras, Grajaú and Usina. 
The minibuses on these lines are officially called <i>Metrônibus</i> and <i>Metrô na Superfície</i> (literally, <i>Subway on Ground</i>), but actually they are just ordinary buses in special routes for subway commuters. 
You can buy tickets for these buses from the normal ticket windows at your departure metro station - just ask for <i>expresso</i> (pronounced "eysh-PREH-sso", not "express-o"). Prices are R$ 5.55 (as of Jun 2018), depending on the transfer you want. This ticket must be kept after crossing the turnstile to the metro. When you leave the destination subway station after the metro ride, give the ticket to the bus driver who shall be waiting in the bus stop just outside of the station. If you don't have an expresso metro ticket, you may use the expresso buses all the same, at the cost of a regular bus ticket.
</p><p>Recently, the last car of each train has been marked with a pink window sticker to indicate that during rush hours this car may be used by women only. This policy, aimed to avoid potential harassment in crowded trains is sometimes considered unnecessary as women have been using Rio's subway for hassle-free everyday travel since long.

<p>Rio's VLT is a modern light rail system serving the downtown and pier areas of Rio de Janeiro.  Its official name is VLT Carioca, the initialism "VLT" (which stands for veículo leve sobre trilhos, literally Light vehicle on rails) being equivalent to the English term light rail.
The network uses 32 modern Alstom Citadis 402 low-floor trams carrying 420 passengers each. They are bi-directional, air-conditioned, have seven sections, and eight doors per side. The total line has 28 km (17 mi)of tracks.

<p>Traffic within some parts of Rio can be daunting, but a car may be the best way to reach distant beaches like Grumari, and that can be an extra adventure. Avoid rush-hour traffic jams in neighborhoods such as Copacabana, Botafogo, Laranjeiras, and Tijuca, where moms line up their cars to pick up their children after school. Buy a map, and have fun.
</p><p>Note that Rio has an interesting program of traffic management. Between 07:00 and 10:00 on weekday mornings the traffic flow of one highway on the beachfront roads of Ipanema and Copacabana is reversed, i.e. all traffic on those roads flows in the same direction, towards the city. Note also that on Sundays the highway closest to the beach is closed to allow pedestrians, cyclists, skateboarders, skaters and others to exercise.
</p><p>Keep in mind that road accidents are quite common, as is reckless and careless driving by locals, who show no regard for safety of others or themselves.

<p>Rio de Janeiro is the perfect city to discover by bike. In the last five years, the city improved its bike lane infrastructure from 100km to almost 400km. The bike lanes are well maintained and extensive - you can bike all the way from Leblon to Centro on dedicated bike lanes along the coast.
</p><p>There is a public system called Bike Rio <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mobilicidade.com.br/bikerio.asp">[17]</a>. The price is R$10 per month or R$5 per day. You can use their mobile app to register, find stations, and withdraw bikes. You can only withdraw bikes by using the app or calling a special phone number. This means you can sign up and start using the bikes immediately. It also means you must always have a phone with mobile internet or credit to make calls. The chances of finding wifi near a docking station are small so mobile data is essential. As of early 2016, the system is so-so. Don't expect to find a bike near the beach after dark. There's no way to report damaged bikes, so if you see on the app that a station has one bike left, don't bother walking there because it'll likely be too damaged to use. As of January 2017, the system is extremely unreliable. In particular, the app tells you to take your chosen bike after the green light is displayed, but more often than not there is no green light and you have to repeatedly try more bikes until you eventually get a green light. Further technical issues result in individual docking stations often being offline for hours or days at a time, meaning that they lose all connectivity with Bike Rio's central servers. When this happens, you can't obtain a bike, but even worse, if you dock a bike at an offline docking station, Bike Rio's servers receive no notification that you have returned the bike and consequently your account will be blocked indefinitely because the system believes that you have stolen the bike, even after the affected docking station becomes online again. It is common for telephone calls to Bike Rio to be unanswered or disconnected, particularly if you press the option for English, leaving you with a blocked account for which you have paid. E-mails are similarly ignored. Therefore always check in the app that a docking station is online before docking a bike in it.

<p>In the last couple of years it has become common to use scooters in Rio de Janeiro. Several rental agencies exist to serve this demand. Travellers that are used to riding motorbikes will find it very comfortable and convenient to zip around Rio de Janeiro on scooter. It gives an extra dose of liberty and autonomy to visit touristic spots little bit further away, such as Vista Chinesa, Prainha, or Largo do Boticário.

<p>Even the most seasoned tourist will find the beaches here quite amazing. They are wide and clean, with soft white sand. The main beaches from Leme to Barra have plenty of services for the beach goers, including free showers at the beach, wet paths to walk on cool sand, clean pay toilets, life-savers and police, tents and chairs for rent, soft drinks and alcoholic bars, and food.
</p><p>The beaches are from East to West (Downtown outwards):
</p>
<ul><li>Ramos (in-bay) - inappropriate for bathing</li>
<li>Flamengo (in-bay) - usually inappropriate for bathing</li>
<li>Botafogo (in-bay) - inappropriate for bathing</li>
<li>Urca (in-bay) - usually inappropriate for bathing</li>
<li>Vermelha (oceanic) - Mostly appropriate for bathing</li>
<li>Leme (oceanic)</li>
<li>Copacabana (oceanic)</li>
<li>Arpoador (oceanic)</li>
<li>Ipanema (oceanic)</li>
<li>Leblon (oceanic)</li>
<li>São Conrado (oceanic) - sometimes inappropriate for bathing</li>
<li>Barra da Tijuca (oceanic)</li>
<li>Recreio dos Bandeirantes (oceanic)</li>
<li>Grumari (oceanic)</li>
<li>Abricó (oceanic, nudist beach)</li></ul>
<p>Abricó is the only official nudist beach in the area of Rio de Janeiro, it lies next to Grumari beach. Only accessible by car/taxi. An option is taking the bus numbered S-20 (Recreio) that passes along Copacabana/Ipanema/Leblon, and from the end of the line (ponto final) take a cab, for a travel time of almost 2 hours.
</p><p>It is also worth visiting the beaches in the island <a href="/en/Paquet%C3%A1" title="Paquetá">Paquetá</a>, particularly:
</p>
<ul><li>Praia da Moreninha (on the Guanabara Bay, but often not clean enough for swimming)</li></ul>
<p>Cariocas have a unique <b>beach culture</b>, with a code of customs which outlanders (even Brazilians from other cities) can misconstrue easily. Despite what many foreigners may believe, women do not go topless on Rio's beaches. The majority of females wear thong bikinis (<i>fio dental</i>). This is the cultural norm, even for some older or larger women, and it doesn't mean they're exhibitionists; most women find it offensive to be stared at. Until the 1990s, men and boys wore <i>speedos</i>, but then wearing bermuda shorts and baggy trunks became more common. Speedos ("sungas" in Portuguese), especially with a square leg cut, have made a comeback. In contrast to women, it is not the cultural norm for men to wear thong swimwear in Rio, and the tiny minority who do so will feel conspicuous. Jammers are less common but still accepted. If you don't want to stand out like an obvious tourist, and therefore a target for thieves, it's best for both women and men to wear similar swimwear to the locals. Walking vendors on the beach are often the best place to buy Brazilian swimwear with low prices and a wide choice.
</p><p>It is important to look after your possessions, particularly on the beaches most popular with tourists - Copacabana and Ipanema. Don't pack all your valuables and clothes into a bag while on the beach, as this only makes it quicker for a thief to steal everything in one go. If you do take valuables to the beach, keep them in front of you while sitting or under your head while lying down.
</p><p>Waves in Rio vary from tiny and calm in the Guanabara bay beaches (Paquetá, Ramos, Flamengo, Botafogo, Urca) to high, surf-ideal waves in Recreio. In Leme, Copacabana, Arpoador, Ipanema, and Leblon, there's a popular way of "riding" the waves called <i>pegar jacaré</i> (pe-GAHR zha-kah-REH; literally, "to grab an alligator"). You wait for the wave to come behind you then swim on top of it until it crumbles next to the sand.
</p><p>Commerce is common in Rio's beaches, with thousands of walking vendors selling everything from sunglasses or bikinis to fried shrimp to cooling beverages (try <i>mate com limão</i>, a local ice tea mixed with lemonade, or <i>suco de laranja com cenoura</i>, orange and carrot juice). For food, there is also <i>empada</i> (baked flour pastry filled with meat or cheese), <i>sanduíche natural</i> (cool sandwich with vegetables and mayo) and middle eastern food (Kibbehs and pastries). Vendors typically shout out loud what they're selling, but they won't usually bother you unless you call them. Some even accept credit cards. All along the beaches there are also permanent vendors who will sell you a beer and also rent you a beach chair and an umbrella for a few Reais.
</p><p>The beaches in Barra and Recreio (Quebra-Mar, Pepê, Pontal, Prainha) were favored by surfers and hang-gliders until the 1980s, but now they are outnumbered by the middle-class and <i>nouveau riche</i> from the suburbs and also West Zone favela residents, such as now world-famous <i>Cidade de Deus</i> (City of God, made famous in the eponymous film).

<p>Viewing Rio from top of the 710 m high <b>Corcovado</b> (meaning <i>hunchback</i>) hill with its landmark statue of <b>Cristo Redentor</b> (Christ the Redeemer) is most impressive and a truly breathtaking experience. There are superb views of the Zona Sul (Copacabana, Ipanema, Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas and Botanical Garden) and inland to the Maracana stadium. 
</p><p>Pedro II ordered the construction of the railroad to Corcovado and, in 1885, a steam train brought the first visitors up the steep mountainside. Some 50 years later, the elegant art deco statue of Cristo Redentor was assembled on site and opened on October 12, 1931. Ever since, Cristo Redentor on top of Corcovado hill is Rios ultimate symbol, receiving over one million visitors a year.
</p><p>Before going, check the weather, because sometimes the clouds envelop the peak, some days throughout the day and more often in the late afternoon. On the other hand, afternoons usually have less haze and no backlight when taking pictures in the direction of Pão de Açúcar. At dusk, enjoy watching as the city lights come on and the statue is bathed in golden lights. When there are low clouds, consider going to the Dona Marta lookout by taxi. At 340m the view is not bad either and there are no crowds. 
</p><p>The trip atop Corcovado starts at the base of the Corcovado train in Cosme Velho, Rua Cosme Velho 513. Get here by taxi or take the Metro-Onibus Expresso combination 580 (see above) from Largo do Machado or bus lines 570, 583 and 584 from Leblon, Ipanema or Copacabana. From Downtown, take the lines 180, 422, 497 and 498. After reaching Cosme Velho, there are shuttle vans to bring you up to the entrance. The shuttle van costs R$25 return (2015 Feb). 
</p><p>The most popular way of reaching the top is the funicular train, ascending 20 minutes long through lush vegetation. It operates 365d/a 08h00 - 19h00 every 30 minutes. A roundtrip ticket is R$51 (students from Brazil and the elderly pay 50% but are usually requested to prove to show some ID or document). You can purchase tickets at numerous lotto kiosks and post offices throughout the city or online <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.corcovado.com.br/ingles/index.html">[18]</a> with the option (R$5) to reserve a seat for any time between 09h00 and 18h00.
</p><p>The queue for the train, in Cosme Velho, can get rather long. Try going when the morning coach parties have already passed through (and many tourists are having their lunch) or in the afternoon. 
</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://nowinrio.com/neighbourhoods/flamengo-laranjeiras-cosme-velho/guide-to-the-christ-the-redeemer/">Going by Van</a> 
</p><p>The official van leaves from three points in the city which makes getting around that little bit easier. The points are at Praca do Lido in Copacabana, next to the metro at Lago do Machado and at Città America in Barra da Tijuca. You can buy the tickets at the bus points (which includes the way there, the way back and the entrance for the Christ) but it’s worth buying online – the queues in Copacabana and Largo do Machado have been known to be up to an hour and a half during high season!
Picking up the van in:
</p><p>Copacabana
The vans leave from Praça do Lido at posto 2 (Avenida Nossa Senhora de Copacabana between Rua Ronald de Carvalho and Rua Belfort Roxo). They leave every 15 minutes and the non-stop route takes about 45 minutes to arrive with usual traffic.
</p><p>Price:
Adults (even students) – R$70 in high season (holidays, carnival, weekends), R$57 in low season
Children 5 to 11 – R$44 in both high and low season
Seniors over 60 – R$37
Children under 5 – free
The van does pick ups in Copacabana every day between 8 am and 5 pm. The final trip back down Corcovado is between 6 pm and 6:30 pm
</p><p>Largo do Machado
The vans leave from Praça do Largo do Machado in front of the church and happen every 15 minutes. It will take about 30 minutes in all to get from there to the entrance to the Christ.
</p><p>Price:
Adults (even students) – R$70 in high season (holidays, carnival, weekends), R$57 in low season
Children 5 to 11 – R$44 in both high and low season
Seniors over 60 – R$37
Children under 5 – free
The van does pick ups at Lago do Machado every day between 8 am and 5 pm. The final trip back down Corcovado is between 6 pm and 6:30 pm
</p><p>Barra da Tijuca
The van leaves from Shopping Città America on Avenida das Americas, 700 and takes place every 30 minutes. It takes about 50 minutes to get from the shopping mall to the top of the Corcovado.
</p><p>Price:
Adults – R$102 in high season and R$89 in low season
Children between 5 and 11 – R$76 in both high and low seasons
Seniors over 60 – R$69
Children under 5 – free
</p><p>The van does pick ups between 8 am and 4:30 pm every day and the last van to go back down Corcovado leaves between 6 pm and 6:30 pm.
You can take a taxi or non-official van (the non-official van costs about R$30 and leaves from Cosme Velho) to the Visitor Center then take an official van the rest of the way (they’re the only ones that are allowed to do that last stretch up to the Christ). I would strongly recommend avoiding the hassle of driving your own car there – there is no parking and it’s so much easier to make the most of the other transport options available.
</p><p>To take the van from the Visitors Center, the prices are as follows:
Adults – R$40 in high season, R$27 in low season.

</p><p>If you opt for a taxi to go atop, expect to pay R$20 round-trip to enter the park, then another R$18 or so for the shuttle up to the monument. Along the way, views onto the city are better than from the funicular.
</p><p>There's also a hiking trail that begins at Parque Lage and gets atop (see Hiking and Trekking on the 'Do' section below). Alternatively, you can hike but the last 3km from the funicular station Paineras on a picturesque trail that passes by several waterfalls and the Dona Marta lookout. Due to numerous robberies on the forest-trail up Corcovado, the path has been closed to the public in past and individuals should opt to take the bus or van up to the top.

<p>The <b>Sugar Loaf mountain</b> with its smaller companion, Morro da Urca, is another Rio top landmark. Going atop is one of the most popular activities in Rio and a definite must-do. Several vantage points offer magnificent views of the bay, the city center and west to the famous beaches and beyond so that you will get a good idea of the layout of the <i>Marvelous city</i>. Do not make the mistake of thinking you have seen enough once you have seen the view from Corcovado. Try Sugar Loaf at sunset for a truly mind-blowing experience.
</p><p>The huge vaulted twin peaks of Morro da Urca and Pão de Açúcar are a natural monument, made mostly of 600 million years old granite. The massif is endowed with lush vegetation, a remnant of the forest that once covered all of the bay areas. The lucky ones can see toucans, parrots, monkeys, and butterflies flitting through the trees.
</p><p>Access is by means of an aerial cable car offering magnificent views. Built in 1912, the so-called <i>Bondinho</i> was one of the first cable cars of this type in the world. The Bondinho is used by 2000 people every day and has two sections: the first going to Morro da Urca (220 m high), the second atop Sugar Loaf (396 m). On top, there is well-developed infrastructure like cafes, restaurants, shops, a cinema, and even a helipad.
</p><p>Take bus 107, 511, 512, or the subway bus 513 from Botafogo to the cable car's base station. Tickets are R$110 (10% discount available if purchased online, 50% discount available for elderly citizens, persons with special needs, students, persons in the age group 6-21 years). The gondolas, accommodating 64 passengers each, are in service between 08h10 and 20h00 (way down until 20h40 and free from 19h00) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bondinho.com.br/site/en/prices-and-hours/">[19]</a>.
</p><p>At the southern foot of Pão de Açúcar is a safe walking trail, the <i>Pista Claudio Coutinho</i>. There, you can stroll along the Atlantic shore or take an unsigned turnoff uphill to the middle station on Morro Urca. If you do hike up Morro da Urca, you can purchase a discounted ticket there to continue by cable car to the Sugarloaf. The trail starts on the northern end of Praia Vermelha and is open daily 08h00 to 18h00 for free.
</p><p>It is also possible to hike to the top of Sugar Loaf, however, rock climbing equipment is required as the trail features a short, vertical section.

<p>There is no shortage of things to do on a rainy day. In addition to a wide range of museums, Rio has many cultural centres, which are run by banks and other organizations and usually host free exhibitions. Details of what is on can be found in the <b>Segundo Caderno</b> section of the daily <b>O Globo</b> newspaper, which provides more detail in a weekly Friday supplement. Also very useful is the <b>Mapa das Artes Rio de Janeiro</b>, which provides detailed bi-monthly listings as well as detailed maps of the city. This is free and can be picked up at most museums.

<p>Still the greatest reason for visiting Rio seems to be the <b>Carnaval</b>. This highly-advertised party lasts for almost two weeks and it is well known for the <i>escolas de samba</i> (samba schools) that parade in Centro, on a gigantic structure called <i>Sambódromo</i> (Sambadrome). During Carnaval, Rio has much more to offer though, with the <i>blocos de rua</i>, that parade on the streets. There are now hundreds of these street "samba blocks", that parade almost in every neighborhood, especially in Centro and the South Zone, gathering thousands of people. Some are very famous, and there are few <i>cariocas</i> that have not heard of "Carmelitas", "Suvaco de Cristo", "Escravos da Mauá" or "Simpatia É Quase Amor".
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:167px;"><a href="/en/File:Sambodromo.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="/upload/en/4/4b/Sambodromo.jpg" decoding="async" width="165" height="130" class="thumbimage" data-file-width="165" data-file-height="130" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/en/File:Sambodromo.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Sambodrome at night. Here thousands spend the night dancing, singing and celebrating their favorite samba school (comparable to soccer teams) till dawn.</div></div></div>
<p>The rest of the year, samba shows are popular with tourists, and are held at several venues like <i>Plataforma</i> and <i>Scala</i>. These are expensive and not really representative of Brazilian culture, they present a lot of almost naked women and bad musicians, a tourist trap (much like the real thing.) Much more interesting and genuine, though, are the night practice sessions held by the various samba schools in the months leading up to Carnaval. You will find only a small number of tourists here, and you will be served the best caipirinhas of your trip! These go on into the wee hours of the morning, with the fun really only starting at 13:00-14:00. A good cab driver should be able to hook you up, and cabs will be available to take you back when you are samba-ed out. Salgueiro and Mangueira are good choices, as they are two of the larger samba schools, and are located relatively close to the tourist areas in a fairly safe area.
</p><p>Note that a change is afoot that may make this genuine experience a thing of the past (or more convenient, depending on your viewpoint) for all but the most savvy tourists. The local government built a complex of buildings (Cidade do Samba) where many of the samba schools are moving their practice halls and float-construction facilities from the gritty warehouses typically located in or near their home favelas. One can expect many more tourists, and shows made-up for the tourists as the tourist bureau milks this facility for all it's worth year-round.
</p><p>Here is a list of some of the samba schools:

<p>Rio was the cradle of three of Brazil's most important musical genres: samba, choro, and bossa nova. In recent years, there has been a boom of traditional samba and choro venues. A lot of them are in the downtown district of <a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro_(city)/Centro" class="mw-redirect" title="Rio de Janeiro (city)/Centro">Lapa</a>. There are good and cheap nightlife options, where you will see some of the best musicians of the country. Any of the city newspapers provide pointers to the best shows.
</p><p>If you're not such an anthropological type of tourist, you can check out the same papers for tips on other kinds of music. Being a big city, Rio has big and small clubs that play almost every kind of music. The major mainstream clubs mostly play whatever's on the Radio - which is usually whatever's on the USA radios and MTV - but the underground scene has a lot to offer on Rock, E-Music, Rap and such. The best way to find out about those are the flyers handed or left at hostels, cinema and theater lobbies, nightclub lines, etc.

<p>Not surprisingly, a huge city that has an actual forest within its limits has lots to offer for hikers. It's always advisable to have a local with you when trekking in Rio (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=1234">Couchsurfing's Rio de Janeiro group</a> usually organizes hikes around the city), as some treks are not very well-marked. Since the early 2000s there hasn't been any reports of violence/burglary on the city's trails (a problem in the 90s), but the rules on the Stay safe section apply as anywhere else in the city. Some of Rio's hiking trails include:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Parque Lage - Corcovado</b></li></ul>
<p>The trek is fairly demanding and steep, and takes about 1h30/2h to complete, but yet very popular among locals - it's normal to see groups of friends doing it and of course foreigners. Ask the park's staff or look for signs that say "Trilha" to get to the start of the trail, just behind the ruins of an old house. From there you have two paths: going straight ahead leads to a waterfall that is usually full of families on the weekends (it's a good spot to stop on your way back if you go back the same way), and left leads straight to the main path of the trek. Along the way there are 3 waterfalls (just one you can actually bath in, though) and a small path where you have to hang on to a chain to pass through some rocks, which also have some iron steps. This will require a little climbing. Until this point you will be going up, but always surrounded by forest. The first views of the city will start after the chain (about 1h/1h30 in). Then you get to the train tracks and the road, which you can follow up to the statue of Christ (another 15/30 minutes). Views from here on are breathtaking. The entrance fee for pedestrians is 26 Real (as of Nov 2016). You can either go back the same way or take the 'tram' (24 R for the ride down) or a van (cheaper). Your entrance ticket includes the shuttle bus to the car park, from there you can take a taxi or try to get an Uber car.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Sugar Loaf/Pão de Açúcar</b></li></ul>
<p>This is a short and fairly easy hike, taking about 30 to 45 minutes to complete, also very popular among locals, especially because you can go up for free then hitch a ride back on the cable car (after 6pm, it's free to return on it - *not anymore May 2016). The hike begins at Pista Cláudio Coutinho in Urca. If you ask the guards they'll point you to the start. It's uphill, but just the first twenty minutes are rather steep, though the trail is very good (like a staircase). Once you reach a saddle just keep to your left. There are amazing views of Urca and the Guanabara Bay during the final 20 minutes, some of which are angles you don't get from the vantage points above. The trek actually ends on top of Morro da Urca, the smallest of the two, to continue to Pão de Açúcar you need climbing gear, or to pay for the cable car. Most people walk back the same way they came.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Pedra da Gávea</b> is a more challenging hike. To get to the trailhead take a bus from Copacabana/Ipanema to <i>Praça Euvaldo Lodi</i> in <i>Barra Tijuca</i>. The area is pretty safe, the hike actually begins in a gated community. There is a ranger station a short while later where you register before starting on the trail proper. Note that there is a short Class 4 climbing section, which is possible without ropes, but not for everybody. Only attempt this hike without a guide if you are in good physical condition and have a head for heights. Remember that you may find climbing down the Class 4 section more difficult than climbing up. You can take a guide, who will provide a rope and get you up and down safely. Best view of Rio, and without the crowds found at other viewpoints. Be aware you hike through jungle for about 2hours each way and that it gets dark VERY quickly, even before sunset, so start your descent in plenty of time.</li></ul>

<p>A number of operators offer tours of Rocinha, the largest (but not the safest) in Rio. Many tours are done by outside companies in safari-like buses, which can lead to awkward interactions with the locals.  Try to go with someone who lives in Rocinha on a walking tour. It is also possible to arrange tours to other favelas, although Rocinha has a longer history of tourism and is one of the more developed favelas.
</p><p>You may hear stories about people being invited by locals to visit their home in a favela.  If you receive such an invitation do think carefully about it and perhaps ask around about the person that has invited you.  Many of the favelas are rife with drugs and guns so think carefully about how much you trust the person that is inviting you.  A search on the Internet may reveal some accounts of tours others have taken.  A visit like this will obviously be more authentic than a book tour and could be the highlight of your visit to Rio; on the other hand you are taking a risk.

<p>Santa Teresa is a neighbourhood in Rio that borders with Lapa. It is located on a hill and has one of the best views of the city. It is more quiet than other parts of Rio with its steep hills and narrow streets. Originally an upper class neighbourhood, it transformed itself into a hub for artists of all kind. The look and feel of Santa Teresa is that of a slow fishertown that got taken over by grafitti artists and the jungle. 
</p><p>Here are some of the best places:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Centro Cultural Municipal Parque das Ruínas</b> is definitely worth a visit when you want to get out of the heat and are looking for a relaxed afternoon. The cultural center is located in a small park next to Museu da Chácara do Céu. The ruin is actually an old mansion and has free entrance and an exposition area on the ground floor. The amazing view and breeze you get on top of the stairs make this house a welcome break from the busy and sizzling city. In the park there is a small bar and some benches to lie down on. On some nights or afternoons the cultural center organises concerts or events.

In 2006, some paintings were stolen, and have not yet been recovered. It is located near the cultural center Parque das Ruínas.

<p>Banks do Money Exchange but only the bigger branches and major currencies. There might be a commission. Better rates can be found at shops with the sign ´´Cambios`´ which base their rates on a semi-official ´´Parallel`` rate, which is slightly higher than the commercial rate and thus better than you will get with a credit card or ATM. These are usually found on the main commercial streets, i.e. Avenida Nossa Senhora de Copacabana, one block from the Copacabana sea front, and Rua Visconde de Pirajá, two blocks from the Ipanema beach. Rates vary, so ask around. The shop offering the best rate today may not offer the best rate tomorrow so if you are changing money more than once ask around again.

<p>Machines have different features, listed in Portuguese above the machine, and do not all return money for foreign cards.  The features can vary between machines at the same bank.  If you are trying to use a foreign card look for Visa/Mastercard logos on the terminals themselves and international banks (HSBC, Citi) as the best starting points.  Also beware that in Rio specifically, most ATMs are closed between 22:00 and 6:00 (10pm and 6am) so plan accordingly. ATMs from Banco do Brasil works with most foreign Visa cards. Note that if you are withdrawing cash using a foreign card, commission may be added without any warning on the screen. You may not realise that commission has been added to your transaction until you get your receipt at the end of the transaction! That's exactly what Santander at the airport did. It charged R$12 for a R$200 withdrawal without any on-screen warning (Feb 2014)! [Additional information required]. Meanwhile (Feb 2016) the ATM access fee at the airport has been increased to 20R per transaction. For cash the commission is 30R per transaction plus a percentage of the amount you change. Moreover the rate is 10 to 20% less than in the city. Access fees for ATMs in the city and rates vary. Santander bank charges 20R per transaction, other banks do not charge this fee at all.

<p>When shopping in street commerce, always bargain; this can lower prices considerably. Bargaining in stores and malls, though, is usually impolite. But naturally merchants won't bargain unless you ask, especially if you are clearly a tourist. To tourists, items can easily be overpriced by a factor of 20% especially in highly informal markets such as Saara or on the beach.
</p>
<ul><li>A typical Brazilian hammock shouldn't be more than R$20-30 but they can sell for up to US$150.</li>
<li>A beer on the beach should cost around R$3.00-R$4.00 ($5-$6 as of Nov 2016)</li>
<li>A caipirinha can be had for around R$7.00-R$9.00 ($10 as of Nov 2016) and you get a great show as the ingredients are produced from a cooler and lime slices muddled before your eyes</li>
<li>You can get coconut water for R$3.00-4.50 ($5 as of Nov 2016)</li>
<li>For trinkets, your best bet is the "hippie fair" in Praça General Osório in <a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro_(city)/Zona_Sul#Buy" class="mw-redirect" title="Rio de Janeiro (city)/Zona Sul">Ipanema</a> every Sunday.</li></ul>
<p>Great bargains can be had on Brazilian-made clothing, as well as some European imports. Most imported items, however, such as electronics, tend to be insanely expensive due to protective import duties. For example, you will find digital cameras sell for about twice what they sell for in Europe or the U.S.
</p><p>Store managers in Rio often speak some English, as this gains employees an almost-automatic promotion. But "some" can be very little, so it is useful to learn at least some very basic Portuguese. Just knowing basic greetings, numbers, and how to ask directions and prices will get you at least a "B" for effort, and despite finding that store clerks may know more English than you Portuguese, it can still come in handy to know a bit of the language. Don't be afraid to resort to writing numbers, pictures, or resorting to pantomime.  Shop assistants will often tap out prices for you on a calculator. Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted in Brazil, with American Express to a significantly lower degree.  But beware that many stores will accept either Visa or Mastercard, but not both! If you carry only one, look for the sign in the store window before attempting to buy.
</p><p>A great choice of gift, since they do not take much space in the suitcase back home, are bikinis, a trademark from Rio for its quality and fashion style.
</p><p><b>Shopping malls</b> can be found all over town, with the cheaper ones in the <a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro/Zona_Norte" title="Rio de Janeiro/Zona Norte">Zona Norte</a> like Shopping Tijuca and Shopping Iguatemi and popular upscale shopping malls concentrated in the <a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro/Zona_Sul" title="Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul">Zona Sul</a> like Shopping Rio Sul and Shopping Leblon and São Conrado Fashion Mall and BarraShopping in <a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro/Zona_Oeste" title="Rio de Janeiro/Zona Oeste">Zona Oeste</a>.

<p>In Rio de Janeiro you can probably find something to fit any craving. A good approach to local food is "comida a kilo" - buffet style restaurants where you pay by the weight of the food on your plate. 
</p><p>For the hungry, nothing beats a good rodízio (all-you-can-eat service). These are available in numerous types, although the most well-known are the churrascaria, all-you-can-eat grilled meats. 
</p><p>At various restaurants around town, you can also find rodízio style dining featuring seafood, pizza, or various appetizer-style snacks. The defining element of rodízio is that unlike an all-you-can-eat buffet, the servers continuously bring skewers of various meats.  
</p><p>Brazil has the largest population of Japanese outside of Japan, and sushi has become widely popular in Rio too. If you are a sashimi and sushi lover, you will find a great deal of options in Rio de Janeiro. 
</p><p>Because its huge coast, many Brazilian specialties are in the seafood area. They are very rich in shrimps, lobster, calamaris, shellfish, clams, mollusks and many other tasty fishes. So, once in this land, don't miss the opportunity to order those lovely dishes.  
</p><p>Travellers with fatter pockets may also splash out a bit at the Dias Ferreira Street in Leblon, Rio's up-and-coming restaurant row.
There are many places to get pizza and lots of restaurants also offer pasta.
</p><p>Rio has open juice bars. Very often, these are located on street corners and have long, curved bars offering you juices from pretty much every fruit you can imagine. The best option is a small chain of juice bars called "Big Bi'". 
The juices are astounding value alongside their good selection of salgados and sandwiches. Their açaí is one of the best in terms of value and taste and the staff are excellent. On top of all this, if you leave a tip, you get a big "Obrigado" (Thank you) from all the staff. For the best Big Bi's experience, try the Tangerina ao Limão juice along with the famous Bauru sandwich for a total of a mere R$15. 
Finish it all off with an açaí to go. Perfect. Big Bi's has a few branches dotted around Copacabana and Ipanema.
</p><p>There are many specialized "health food" shops that offer an incredible variety of rich meat and vegetable sandwiches, plus an awesome variety of fruit juices, many of them delicious and usually unknown by foreigners. Among them are graviola, fruta do conde, jaca, açaí, guaraná, pitomba, mango, coconut, orange, lemon, papaya, melon, etc. They make it as you ask and all food is 100% organic and fresh. 
The meal is often prepared as you wait, so you can ask them to mix whatever fruit you want and create a customized mix if you like. You must try açaí and guaraná, Amazon fruits which are famous to be the strongest energizers and anti-oxidants of the world. 
They also offer Brazilian snacks (including many Italian and Oriental delicacies), and other simple but delicious things to eat. I never got enough of them! These shops usually are cheap and hang many fruits at the entrance or somewhere visible to display their quality.
Warning: look for clean places, as hygiene can be poor in many street shops.
</p><p>Some different flavours:
</p>
<ul><li>Coxinha - Rio is also famous for its pastries and street food, heritage from Portuguese and old European culture. In most cafeterias (lanchonete; lun-sho-NETCH) you can have a pastel (pahs-TELL) or salgado(saw-GAH-do; local pastry) for less than R$3. Typical pastries are coxinha (ko-SHEEN-ya; chicken nugget shaped like a chicken leg), and unique Rio's joelho (zho-EH-lyo; rolled dough filled with ham and cheese). Also try pão de queijo (paw-djee-KAY-zhoo; cheese baked dough), typical from Minas Gerais but very common in Rio as well, and tapioca (typical from Bahia), a kind of crepe made out of manioca flour.</li>
<li>Guaraná - For drinking, ask for guaraná (gwa-ra-NAH; soda made from the seed of an Amazon fruit, also available as a strong drink), mate (MAHTCH; sweet ice tea; not like Rio Grande do Sul or Argentina's hot and sour mate), água de coco (ah-gwa-djee-KOH-ku; natural coconut water) or caldo de cana (caw-do-djee-KAH-na; sugarcane juice).</li>
<li>Açaí - There is also a common fruit called açaí (ah-sah-EEH), with a dark-purple pulp out of which are made juices, and ice-creams. Typical cariocas eat it like cream in cups or glasses, mixed with granola, oats or other flakes.</li></ul>
<p>If your palate is homesick for more familiar tastes, Rio has most of the fast-food chains found around the world (McDonald's, KFC, Domino's, Outback, Subway, Pizza Hut and Burger King). Bob's and Habib's are the biggest national fast food chains.
Many foods that in other countries are simply picked up in the hands and eaten or are eaten with knife and fork (such as pizza), also are picked up by wrapping a napkin around the food so that it is not touched with the hands (such as sandwiches). You will undoubtedly notice napkin dispensers on the tables in most restaurants for this purpose.

<ul><li><b>Botequim</b>s (pronounced 'boo-chi-KEEN'), also well known as botecos are quite unpretentious bars with simple appetizers and lots of ice-cold <i>chope</i> (draft beer).

<ul><li><b>Juice bars</b> can also be found on nearly every corner for refreshing juices in the often hot and muggy city.

<p>Samba clubs are live music bars with great atmosphere where locals go for dancing and meeting people. When in Rio, don't miss visiting one. Most of these bars work with a kind of consumption card, which is handed to you when you enter.  Everything you consume is marked on this card, and losing it means you'll have to pay a high fee (sometimes more than R$200,00!) - so take good care of it. 
There are countless samba clubs in the town, a couple in the <a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro/Zona_Sul#Samba_clubs" title="Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul">Zona Sul</a>, but most in Rios the nightlife district, <a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro/Centro#Samba_clubs" title="Rio de Janeiro/Centro">Lapa</a>.

<p>Rio has some good options for clubbers. You'll be seeing lots of flyers talking about "raves". Usually Rio's raves are devoted to trance, which is pretty popular, especially with the upper-class youngsters, though some electronic parties do offer djs of other styles. The night in Rio is pretty much divided between mainstream and underground.
</p><p>Mainstream would be such "raves" and big electronic festivals, as well a nightclubs like Bombar (Leblon and Barra da Tijuca), Baronetti (Ipanema) and Melt (Leblon) that are devoted to pop, dance and variations of house and trance. Those are not, however, places you go for the music. They are usually packed with "patricinhas" (tanned, long soft-haired girls with gym-built bodies) and specially "pitboys" (upper/middle-class boys, known for having various degrees of martial arts training and a certain tendency for violence). Yes, fights are one of the major problems with the mainstream clubbing scene in Rio. It's also fairly expensive. Expect to pay between R$30 and R$50 to get in a club (girls pay less, but all those clubs will have an f/m proportion around 1/3) and between R$50 and R$100 for a "rave" or electronic music party being held at spots like the Marina.
</p><p>Though with far less options, the underground clubbing scene is more available and interesting than the mainstream. Most of the underground clubs are on Zona Sul and offer different parties for each day of the week. The underground club scene has a more diverse public, from goths to punks also with strong hedonistic tints. It's very gay-friendly and most of the parties and clubs have almost the same m/f proportion. It is also far cheaper than the mainstream clubs, with tickets starting as low as R$5 and not going further up than R$25. Some good alternative clubs are Fosfobox (Copacabana), Dama de Ferro (Ipanema) and Casa da Matriz (Botafogo).
</p><p>For a real "carioca" experience, try Mariuzinn Copacabana. Brazilian Funk and eletronic music, with a eccentric crowd. It just finishes when the last dancer gives up. Which means early in the morning. It will be an unforgettable experience.

<p>Thursday to Saturday nights see the party from the bars and clubs in <a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro/Centro" title="Rio de Janeiro/Centro">Lapa</a> extend into the street. People play and dance to Samba, Choro (soft rhythm with flutes and mandolin), Reggae and Hip Hop, as well as ballroom music (<i>gafieira</i>), but not to Pop or Rock (except for some underground, which doesn't happen often or in the same place, but usually in some less known places of Lapa). While drinks are sold in the bars and clubs, vendors roam the streets wearing coolers full of beer for cheaper prices. Be sure not to bring valuables, as there are a lot of pick-pockets operating in the area.

<p>Watching a football (soccer) match at <i>Maracanã</i> can be very exciting, but also very dangerous. Atmosphere gets hottest, when two of the local Rio teams are playing (Flamengo, Fluminense, Botafogo, and Vasco). If it looks like the team for which the fans around you are cheering is losing, it is wise to leave the stadium before the match ends. You don't want to be in the middle of a very angry bunch of football fans when they all cram out of the stadium.

<p>In the <b><a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro/Zona_Sul#Sleep" title="Rio de Janeiro/Zona Sul">Zona Sul</a></b>, you will find Rio's fanciest and most popular hotels along the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana, but there are lots of small, cheap, clean hotels around Flamengo and Catete. The street in front of the strip of tourist hotels in Copacabana can be seedy, due to both garishly-dressed tourists, and a few opportunistic locals ready to take advantage of them. The apart-hotels in Ipanema are a much more pleasant alternative, being both better appointed and in a nicer neighborhood with fewer tourists.
</p><p>Accommodation in the lower <b><a href="/en/Rio_de_Janeiro/Centro#Sleep" title="Rio de Janeiro/Centro">Centro</a></b> can be convenient for business travellers. The surrounding areas, however, are far from pleasant at night, being nearly deserted and lacking decent restaurants and leisure options. The central <b>Santa Teresa</b> neighbourhood, however, is quite departed from the city centre life and has plenty of pleasant bed and breakfasts and a significant nightlife.     
</p><p>Given Rio's rise as a fashionable destination with creative and fashion people, some hotels that cater to the <b>design-conscious</b> crowd have also been popping up at the most upscale neighborhoods.  The city also has a large selection of <b>apart-hotels</b>, which provide apartment-style accommodations with kitchen facilities.  Private condominium <b>apartments</b> can also be rented short-term at reasonable rates, and can be found on the internet. This is probably a preferable means of finding one of these than the notes that will be passed to you by anonymous persons on the street.  These apartments generally have a one-week minimum, or two weeks during Carnaval or New Years holidays.
</p><p>Accommodation in Rio is probably <b>Brazil's most expensive</b>. There is a relative shortage of hotel rooms on the cheaper range and booking in advance is recommended. Moreover, prices for most accommodation can more than triple during New Year's and Carnival. Those are very busy periods and booking <i>well</i> in advance is recommended. Note that most hotels in tourist areas will only sell 4-day packages and charge in advance - even if you want to stay only for a couple of days during those events. Other than those, the busiest month is January - summer holidays in Brazil.
</p><p>Motels, that you will see mainly on the outskirts of the city, are not motels in the North American sense. Rather, they are places you go with your lover for a few hours. One famous motel, overlooking the Sheraton in Leblon, was taken over by the US Secret Service when George Bush Sr stayed at the Sheraton. It is not recorded whether heart-shaped beds, mirrors on the ceiling and on-tap porno movies affected their work!
</p><p>If <b>hostel</b> life is more your style, they are easy to find in Rio. The more expensive ones boast locations that are short walking distance to either Ipanema or Copacabana beach. However if you prefer to stay in Lapa, Glória, Catete, Flamengo and Botafogo, there are many other choices available. Hostelling has become increasingly popular in Brazil, and many of them are located at walking distance from hot spots. Beware, however, not to be taken to any fraudulent scheme - you might end up being robbed. Look for accredited places with Youth Hostelling International and similar franchises. You can find the best price/quality in Lapa, like Bananaz Hostel and ZambaBem Hostel.

<p>Rio is vulnerable to epidemics of <a href="/en/Dengue_fever" title="Dengue fever">dengue fever</a>, particularly during the late summer months of February and March. Dengue can result in a serious illness.  It is spread by a specific type of mosquito that often bites unprotected ankles, hand and parts of the face during the evening hours.  If an epidemic occurs, be sure to take the appropriate precautions by using insect repellent and, if you happen to be staying at a place with a balcony, make sure there is no standing water around.
</p><p>As elsewhere in Brazil, some beaches in Rio are not suitable for bathing, and conditions can change from day to day.

<p>It is important to note that while the following information may panic you and also make you question whether to go or not to Rio, most visitors to the city have a great time with no incidents.
</p><p>As a traveler, even if you don't leave the "Zona Sul" (which include Copacabana, Ipanema, Leblon, Gávea, Jardim Botânico, Flamengo, Laranjeiras, Botafogo, Urca) or Western Suburbs (Barra, Recreio), you may experience a palpable tension over security.
</p><p>Generally, tourists (gringos) and teenagers are considered "easy" targets for criminals. Day-to-day living has also been affected by this. For example, regular banks all have fortress style security doors and armed security men. Rio <i>can</i> be a dangerous city and it is wise to follow these rules even if they seem over exaggerated. 
</p><p>In order to fully enjoy your trip the traveler should pay attention to simple things. Avoid the downtown area, especially <i>Saara</i>, after dark. Although downtown is a relatively safe place during the day, after-dark all the people who work there have already gone home. If you are going to a theater or a show, it's all right; but do not wander in those dark streets by night. Go to Ipanema beach, all lighted and policed during the night, though even there is not entirely safe for tourists who look obviously like tourists.
</p><p>On Sunday in particular most shops are closed and their security guards are absent so the neighbourhood Centro is not safe during the daytime. Also, even the bigger streets in Copacabana are less safe after dark so a walk along the beach is probably the best option. It's not safe to walk along the shore by the beaches after dark. Even though the sidewalk 100 meters away may be full of people walking, the beach could be dark and deserted. This allows muggers to easily escape after robbing someone.
</p><p>Should you find yourself being mugged, the normal advice applies:
</p><p>Don't resist or do anything to aggravate the muggers. Try not to stare in their faces as they might think you are memorizing their appearance. Eyes to the ground is probably your best bet. Let them take anything they want (keep your arms limp). Do not panic.  Even if they are armed, if you comply and allow them to take what they want, they will not harm you.  Afterwards, leave the scene quickly but calmly (don't run in panic screaming for the police). 
</p><p>In the morning, especially before the police arrive, if you are walking or jogging on, Copacabana should be considered unsafe. Even with people around, joggers are popular targets for mugging. If you plan on jogging make sure not to wear anything that may tempt a mugger (watch, iPod etc) and if you can, wait until after 10:00 AM.
</p><p>When in downtown during the rush hour, be aware of pickpockets as in any other big city centre. The difference in Rio is that the pickpocket can often be a bit violent: one of them pushing you forward in the bus or to the ground in the street while another one takes your wallet and runs away. It's not that usual or as bad as it sounds, but try to avoid being in real danger by reacting strongly as these guys often operate in armed groups (2-5 people), some unnoticed by you.
</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><a href="/en/File:Rescue_8.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="/upload/en/thumb/2/2c/Rescue_8.jpg/300px-Rescue_8.jpg" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" class="thumbimage" srcset="/upload/en/thumb/2/2c/Rescue_8.jpg/450px-Rescue_8.jpg 1.5x, /upload/en/thumb/2/2c/Rescue_8.jpg/600px-Rescue_8.jpg 2x" data-file-width="2344" data-file-height="1564" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/en/File:Rescue_8.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>On weekends, beaches in Rio are watched by helicopters.</div></div></div>
<p>In the area around Copacabana beach (and maybe in the city centre), the tourist should be aware of a shoe shining scam. The tourist will be approached by a shoeshiner and to his astonishment discover a large, dirty blot on his shoes (which is actually shoe polish or mustard but looks like quite something else). The tourist is typically shown to a chair and has his shoes or sandals cleaned in the best manner. Only after this service is rendered, the outrageous price of somewhere around R$1000 or more is revealed. At this point, muscular friends of the shoeshiner typically appear to "oversee" the completion of the transaction. 
</p><p>The subway is fairly safe, so it is recommended to use it if you want to go from one place to another. Although you may be used to taking the handy and good trains in Europe or even in North America to go across many places, you won't need to take a train in Rio. If you do, it can be a fairly nice trip to the suburbs or a chaotic journey to a bad neighborhood in a train where people sell all kinds of weird stuff, where everyone will look at you in a way you will feel you are a alien, about to be mugged.
Buses on the South Zone are fairly safe as well, but, in the city centre, they can be quite crowded. Inside a bus, being mugged is always a threat: less so but still possible in the South and tourist zones. Always remember that <i>Bus 174</i> movie. It happens so often that they don't even go to the news (only homicides or big cases where the police got involved such as this <i>Bus 174</i> go to the news). In the subway, it is quite unlikely though, which is one extra point to the subway!
</p><p>Don't walk around with lots of money in your pocket. ATM's are everywhere (prefer the ones inside shopping centres) and credit/debit cards are widely accepted. But don't walk around without any money: you may need something to give to the bad guys in case you are mugged. Not having money to give a mugger can be dangerous as they may get angry and resort to violence. An excellent idea is to buy a "capanga" (literally meaning bodyguard), that is, a small frontal unisex pouch, normally used to carry your wallet, checks, money and car keys.
</p><p>Avoid wearing jewelry or other signs of wealth (iPods, fancy cell phones/mobiles, digital cameras, etc.) if possible, at any time of the day, as these attract attention. Thieves have been known to run past targets and tear off necklaces, rings, and earrings without stopping. Earrings are particularly dangerous as tearing them off often harms the owner.
</p><p>There are around 700 favelas in the city and most of them can potentially be unsafe in Rio: and there is always one near you (by a couple of miles or just a few yards). These are easily recognized by their expansive brick walls, and are often on a hillside. The slums grew from being impoverished neighborhoods but are now large areas ruled by drug lords. If you want to keep your nice impression of Rio, you don't need to go there. However, some favelas are amazingly huge, and a new experience for some -- there are some travel agencies who take people on tours there. If you want to go, pay one of those agencies. <b>NEVER</b> go to a favela by yourself, or with an unknown guide. The tour operators have "safe-conduct pacts" with the local drug dealers. If you don't have one, you'll be in BIG trouble. You'll most likely be approached by the drug baron's guards and asked what you are doing there (and these guys typically don't speak English). If you don't have a good reason (and you probably don't), the consequences could be dire. Don't count on the police to help you, as they don't like to enter the favela either, except in special circumstances, though most likely they will check if you are carrying any drugs upon leaving the favela.
</p><p>In Brazil, every state has two police forces: the Civil (<i>Polícia Civil</i>) and Military (<i>Polícia Militar</i>). Only the latter wear uniform (in Rio, it is navy blue). The city of Rio also has an unarmed Civil Guard, dressed in khaki. Policemen can usually be trusted, but corruption in Brazil is still rampant and a few officers may try to extort you or demand a small bribe. When this happens, it is usually very subtle, and the officer may typically say something about "some for the beer" (<i>cervejinha</i>). If you are not willing, refuse and ask for another officer. Don't ever try to bribe a policeman on your own--most of them are honest and you might end up in jail.
</p><p>The local emergency dial number is <i>190</i>. All operators speak in Portuguese as they do not have English-speaking operators available and you will face problems overcoming the language barrier, making emergencies extremely difficult if you are not fluent in Portuguese.
</p><p>At night, especially after traffic has died down, you may hear what sounds like fireworks and explosions. This is not as menacing as it sounds, though it is still indicative of somebody up to no good. These are often firecrackers set-off as signals in the favelas. It might mean that a drug shipment has arrived and is in-transit or that the police are making a raid into the favela. It is a signal to gang operatives who act as lookouts and surrogate police to be extra-vigilant. However, real shoot-outs may occur, especially on weekends. If you are on the street and you hear a shooting, find shelter in the nearest shop or restaurant.
</p><p>For your safety, cross at the crosswalks, not closer to the corner, and watch for cars regardless of traffic lights.
</p><p>Carjacking can be a threat too, especially if you are outside the tourist areas and after dark. It is perfectly acceptable (even if not exactly legal) not to stop in the traffic lights if there is nobody else on the street and you feel it's okay to go (if there are no other cars). You will see even police doing this. Some major motorways such as <i>Linha Amarela</i> (Yellow Line: connects the west zone (<i>Barra da Tijuca</i>) to the north zone - may be your way to <i>Norte Shopping</i> for example) and <i>Linha Vermelha</i> (Red Line - the main connection from the International Airport) are strongly avoided late at night. Both motorways are surrounded by favelas so carjacking is usual and shoot-outs may occur between rival drug lords or between drug lords and the police. If you rent a car, be aware of all these issues. As a tourist, it may be better not to rent one anyway, as if you get lost and go to a bad neighbourhood (and again, there will always be one near you), you will most likely be in trouble.

<ul><li><a href="/en/Angra_dos_Reis" title="Angra dos Reis">Angra dos Reis</a> and <a href="/en/Ilha_Grande" title="Ilha Grande">Ilha Grande</a>. Angra is surrounded by 365 islands, the largest being Ilha Grande, a pretty island and former penal colony with beautiful beaches and good hiking. Angra is 2-3 hours from Rio by car and it is a one-hour boat ride from there to Ilha Grande.</li>
<li><a href="/en/Arraial_do_Cabo" title="Arraial do Cabo">Arraial do Cabo</a> is a small town near Búzios. Its beaches have the most beautiful turquoise waters of Rio de Janeiro state. Beaches like Forno and Prainhas do Atalaia are surrounded by virgin lush green coastal vegetation and have clear blue waters similar to the Caribbean ones.</li>
<li><a href="/en/B%C3%BAzios" class="mw-redirect" title="Búzios">Búzios</a> is a small peninsula about three hours east of Rio. It has several beaches, lots of places to stay and an abundance of night clubs.</li>
<li><a href="/en/Niteroi" class="mw-redirect" title="Niteroi">Niteroi</a> - The ferry between Rio and Niteroi, a city across the bay, is a pleasant and cheap trip (as of October 2010, R$ 2.80). There are a couple of kinds of boats, ranging from very cheap and slow (called <i>barca</i>) to fairly cheap and fast (called <i>catamarã</i>, catamaran).  Niteroi does not have many tourist attractions, but it does have a wonderful unique view of Rio, an intriguing contemporary art museum <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.macniteroi.com.br/">[52]</a>, which looks like a flying saucer jutting out over the sea, and the Niemeyer way - a park with several buildings including a theater - (All designed by famous architect Oscar Niemeyer). Many of the state's most beautiful beaches can be reached from this side of the bay: Itacoatiara bus number 38 or 770D, Camboinhas and Pratinininga 39.</li>
<li><a href="/en/Paraty" title="Paraty">Paraty</a> - One hour south of Angra, this is a fully-conserved 18th-century colonial town by the ocean, hidden by tall jungle-covered mountains which used to be a hideout for pirates after the Portuguese ships; a must-see for people interested in History and Culture; also good for Rainforest hiking and kayaking.</li>
<li><a href="/en/Paquet%C3%A1" title="Paquetá">Paquetá</a> -- Though not exactly outside of Rio, because it is an island and can only be reached by a 70 minutes ferry ride, this district of Rio makes an excellent (and inexpensive) day trip. The island is an car-free zone, so travel is limited to bicycles and horse-drawn carriages. There's not a lot to do on this island, but the ferry ride is worth it.</li>
<li><a href="/en/Petropolis" class="mw-redirect" title="Petropolis">Petrópolis</a> - In the mountains outside Rio. A good place to cool down when Rio becomes too hot.</li>
<li>Praia do Abricó <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.anabrico.com/i_abertura.htm">[53]</a> The best public naturist beach around Rio, located in Grumari, right after Prainha.
