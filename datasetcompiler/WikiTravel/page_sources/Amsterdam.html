With more than one million inhabitants in its urban area (and almost two and a half million inhabitants in its metropolitan area), it is the country's largest city and its financial, cultural, and creative centre.
</p><p>Amsterdam derives its name from the city’s origin as “Dam” of river “Amstel”. In the past, the name was "Amstelredamme" which later changed as “Amsterdam”.  Amsterdam is one of the most popular destinations in Europe, attracting over 7 million international travellers annually. 
</p><p>Amsterdam is colloquially known as <i>Venice of the North</i> because of its lovely canals that criss-cross the city, its impressive architecture and more than 1,500 bridges.  There is something for every traveller's taste here; whether you prefer culture and history, serious partying, or just the relaxing charm of an old European city.

<p>Settled as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important trading centres in the world during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century, with the first stock exchange and the joint ventures that gave birth to modern day Capitalism. The city's small medieval centre rapidly expanded as the Jordaan and the Canal Belt neighbourhoods were constructed; the latter's cultural significance was acknowledged when it became a <a href="/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List" title="UNESCO World Heritage List">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> in 2010. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded in all directions, with many new neighbourhoods and suburbs designed in modernist styles. 
</p><p>Amsterdam is not the seat of the government, which is in <a href="/en/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>. It has always been a city that attracted many people from outside its borders. Nowadays it's the city with the most different nationalities in the world (178 in 2010). The city has an informal atmosphere unlike other capital cities its size. In fact, Amsterdam has a history of non-conformism, tolerance and progressivism, all of which come together in its liberal policies concerning cannabis and teleiophilic prostitution. Other attractions include the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Anne Frank House, the Flower Market, Albert Cuyp Market, and the Vondelpark.

<p>The "Amsterdam" that most visitors experience is the city centre, the semi-circle with Central Station at its apex. It corresponds to the city as it was around 1850. Six major concentric canals ring the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Old_Centre" title="Amsterdam/Old Centre">Old Centre</a>; the Singel, the Herengracht, the Keizersgracht, the Prinsengracht, the Lijnbaansgracht, and the Singelgracht, together forming the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Canal_Ring" title="Amsterdam/Canal Ring">Canal Ring</a>. Other districts inside the city centre are the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Jordaan" title="Amsterdam/Jordaan">Jordaan</a>, a former working-class area gone upmarket, and <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Plantage" title="Amsterdam/Plantage">Plantage</a>, a leafy and spacious area known for its zoo and botanical gardens. The roads Nassaukade, Stadhouderskade, and Mauritskade surround the centre and mark the location of the former city moat and fortifications. Almost everything outside this line was built after 1870. 
</p><p>The semi-circle is on the south side of the <b>IJ</b>, originally the estuary of the Amstel to the Zuiderzee (South sea), nowadays canalised. Going east from Central Station, the railway passes the artificial islands of the redeveloped <b>Eastern Docklands</b>. North of the IJ is mainly housing, although a major dockland redevelopment has started there too.
</p><p>The river Amstel flows into the city from the south. Originally, it flowed along the line Rokin-Damrak. The <b>dam in the Amstel</b>, which gives the city its name, was located under the present Bijenkorf department store. The original settlement was on the right bank of the Amstel, on the present Warmoesstraat: it is therefore the oldest street in the city. The city has expanded in all directions, except to the northeast of the ring motorway. That area is a protected rural landscape of open fields and small villages that could be considered a part of the <a href="/en/Waterland_and_Zaan_Region" title="Waterland and Zaan Region">Waterland</a> region.
</p><p>The radius of the semi-circle is about 2km. All major tourist destinations, and most hotels, are located inside it or just outside it. As a result, a large swathe of Amsterdam is never visited by tourists: at least 90% of the population lives outside this area. Most economic activity in Amsterdam — the offices of the financial sector, and the port — is near or outside the ring motorway, which is 4-5km from the centre.
</p><p>The expansion of Amsterdam outside this beltway, and the expansion of activity outside the old centre, is redefining what locals consider the 'central area' of Amsterdam. Without a doubt the most popular district outside of the city centre is the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/South" title="Amsterdam/South">South</a> for its quality museums and gentrified neighbourhood 'De Pijp'.

<p>Many people choose to visit Amsterdam because of its reputation for tolerance, although part of this reputation is attributable to cultural misunderstandings. Prostitution is legalised and licensed in the Netherlands, and in Amsterdam it is very visible (window prostitution), and there are large numbers of prostitutes. The sale, possession, and consumption of small quantities of cannabis, while technically illegal, is tolerated by authorities (the policy of <i>gedogen</i>). This does not mean that you can get away with anything in Amsterdam. In any case, public attitudes and official policy have hardened in recent years. For more on coffeeshops and drugs, see below in <a href="/en/Amsterdam#Stay_safe" title="Amsterdam">Stay safe</a>.
</p><p>Depending on your viewpoint some people will consider Amsterdam an unwholesome city whereas other people will find their relaxed attitudes refreshing. If you avoid the red light district, Amsterdam is an excellent family destination.

<p>Amsterdam is a large city and a major tourist destination, so you can visit it all year round. However, in winter the days are short (8 hours daylight around Christmas), and the weather may be too cold to walk around the city comfortably, let alone cycle. January and February are the coldest months, with lows around -1°C and highs around 5°C. July and August are the warmest months, with an average temperature of 22°C (72°F). Some things are seasonal: the tulip fields flower only in the spring, and as of 2014, after the abdication of Queen Beatrix on 30 April 2013, King's Day (<i>Koningsdag</i>) is, unless it falls on a Sunday, on 27 April, the birthday of King Willem-Alexander. If the 27 April is on Sunday, the birthday of the king is celebrated on 26 April.

<ul><li><b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.ns.nl/en/travellers/home">NS Dutch Railways</a></b> operates trains to/from the lower level of the airport. Trains run approximately every 10 minutes between 5:00AM and 1:00AM and hourly during other hours. There are several train stations in Amsterdam and not every train stops at every station; note which station is closest to your accommodation. Also note that trains departures at Schiphol often display 2 platforms (for example: platform 1-2, 3-4 or 5-6), as the exact platform a train departs from is selected only a few minutes before departure (this way, more trains can arrive and depart from the limited amount of tracks underneath Schiphol). During rush hours tourists have been known to cause train delays in the past. To prevent such delays, the Dutch Railways have started to employ crowd controllers at Schiphol during rush hours to navigate tourists and other travellers into the trains on time. In the trains you can use WIFI for free.</li></ul>
<p>The journey to Amsterdam takes 20 minutes and costs €4.50. Tickets can be bought from yellow ticket machines or from the ticket counter, although purchases from the ticket counter incur a €1.00 surcharge. Any purchase paid with Visa or Mastercard will be charged with €0.50 extra (unlike payments with Maestro cards or cash).

<p>Using airports other than Schiphol could prove cheaper in some cases, as some budget airlines fly to Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports. Then buses and trains can be used to get to Amsterdam. Renting a car is also an option. Taxis are extremely expensive in the Netherlands (€100+ from Rotterdam and even more from Eindhoven) and it is advisable to book them upfront.

Alternatively, take the express bus directly from the airport to Amsterdam central station, which takes 2h15. This service goes only 3 to 4 times per day; see their website for a schedule.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_car">By car</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Amsterdam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: By car">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The western part of the Netherlands has a dense (and congested) road network. Coming from the east (Germany), the A1 motorway leads directly to Amsterdam. On the A12 from Arnhem, change at <a href="/en/Utrecht" title="Utrecht">Utrecht</a> to the A2 northbound. From the south (Belgium), the A2 goes directly to Amsterdam: the A16 /A27 from <a href="/en/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> via <a href="/en/Breda" title="Breda">Breda</a> connects to the A2 south of Utrecht. From <a href="/en/The_Hague" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, the A4 leads to Amsterdam. All motorways to Amsterdam connect to the ring motorway, the A10. From this motorway, main roads lead radially into Amsterdam (the roads S101 through S118).
</p><p>In most cases, you'll want to avoid going into the city center by car: traffic is dense and parking spaces are expensive (4-8 € per hour, 25-40 € daily max.) Instead, when on the A10, follow the signs to one of the <b>P+R</b>-spots (P+R Zeeburg to the east, P+R ArenA to the southeast, P+R <i>Olympisch Stadion</i> to the south, and P+R <i>Sloterdijk</i> to the west). Here you can park your car for 6 € per day (for up to 4 days, except P+R RAI, which is limited to 24 hours) if you strictly adhere to the following rules:<br />
1. drive in on weekdays AFTER 10 a.m. (otherwise it's 13 € for the first day) OR anytime on weekends,<br />
2. take public transportation to the "city center area" USING either the P+R ticket purchased there* or your OV card<br />
3. take public transportation back from the "city center area" AND pay for parking WITHIN one hour of checking out of the public transport<br />
The discounted P+R ticket (sold at the P+R lots, called "GVB P+R") for the ride into town and back costs an additional 6 € for one or two persons and incrementally up to 9,50 € for five people. You may use your OV-card, but NOT a contactless debit/credit card or a smartphone app.<br />
FAIL TO FOLLOW THESE RULES EXACTLY AND YOU WILL BE ON THE HOOK FOR ABOUT 30 € PER DAY.<br />
</p><p>Another option is to use different parking websites to find out about prices and available parking garages, one can find a nice overview about all the public parking garages there in the city and the prices they charge. Besides public garages, there are also private parking opportunities since recently whereby one can park in a hotel or company building, the advantage is that you can make a reservation for your parking in advance and often this alternative is also cheaper. 
</p><p>For short visits, an option is to park very close to the city centre for free and take a free ferry to other side of the channel: From to A10 ring, take S118 or S116 exit (S118 is easiest, because S116 goes to the city centre by tunnel under the channel) and go to Ijplein where the parking is free for 2,5 hours (so-called "blauwe zone") using a parking disc. Then go to the ferry stop and take the free transport to the central station (every 5-8 minutes). Just a 5min trip and you are in Amsterdam Centraal. Enjoy!
</p><p>The speed limit on motorways in the Netherlands is 130 km/h by default, but most stretches are limited to 100 km/h during the day and 120 km/h at night by posted signs. On the A10 ring motorway around Amsterdam, the maximum speed is 100km/h and only 80km/h on the western section. These limits are strictly enforced and there are many speed cameras.

<p>Amsterdam's centre is fairly small, and almost abnormally flat, so you can easily get to most tourist destinations <b>on foot</b> - from the train station, within half an hour.

<p>The public transport network in Amsterdam is extensive with buses, trams, metro's and trains serving almost all areas of the city and beyond. 
</p><p>Throughout the Netherlands a contactless smart card system called  <i>OV-chipkaart</i> ("public transport chip card") is used for travel on buses, trams, metros and trains and some ferries. The OV-chipkaart is available in disposable form (for occasional passengers, such as tourists) and reusable versions (for frequent travelers, either in anonymous or personalized forms). To travel with a OV-chipkaart, one has to check in at the start of the journey and check out at the end by holding the card in front of the card reader.
</p><p>Disposable <i>OV-chipkaart</i> tickets can be used for single or return train tickets, hourly or day passes, seasonal tickets and discount plans. In most cases disposable tickets are only valid for travel by the transport company you bought the ticket from. Disposable tickets cannot be used for rides of other transport companies. Although there are some exceptions, such as the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.ns.nl/producten/en/uitleg-overige-producten/p/amsterdam-travel-ticket">Amsterdam Travel Ticket</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/plan-your-trip/getting-around/public-transport/amsterdam-region-travel-ticket">Amsterdam &amp; Region Travel Ticket</a>. The disposable <i>OV-chipkaart</i> tickets are probably your best option if you are in Amsterdam for just couple of days of less.
</p><p>Reusable OV-chipkaart cards are used as a stored-value card which is used to travel on pre-loaded credit. Which can be used for travel on all public transport companies. A reusable OV-chipkaart cost €7.50 for the card itself, and you have to have at least €4 on it to be able to travel. Travel cost are usually lower when you use reusable OV-chipkaart.  
</p><p>It is best to buy your ticket in advance, at tickets machines on train or metro stations, service desks at large trains stations or at tobacconist's or kiosk's. A ticket on board of a bus or tram can only be purchased using a debit or credit card. Cash payments are not accepted on board.

<p>Public transport within the city is operated by the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://en.gvb.nl/pages/home.aspx">GVB (Gemeentevervoerbedrijf</a>. The <b>tram</b> (14 lines) is the main form of public transport system in the central area, and there are also dozens of night bus routes which run in place of the trams between midnight and 5am. All tram stops have a detailed map of the system and the surrounding area. You can also get a free public transport map at the GVB Tickets &amp; Info offices (just outside Centraal Station) or in the tram.
</p><p>Most trams have conductors near the rear of the tram. Board (and obtain tickets if necessary) from the driver or the conductor. The tram conductors no longer take cash payments, so you will need to use a credit card or OV-chipkaart.<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://en.gvb.nl/reizen/cashloos-ov/geen-contant-geld-meer-de-tram">[11]</a> If you have questions, the conductor or driver will be sure to respond to your query. Remember that you can only buy 1h and 24h tickets on board the tram. 
</p><p>When boarding and alighting a tram, you must check in and out by placing your ticket/OV-chipkaart on one of the abundant round-shaped readers, even if you have just bought a ticket on board. All trams have pre-recorded audio announcements indicating the next stop, with most also having visual indication. All announcements on board are in Dutch, however some announcements (such as those indicating termini and important stops (such as Dam Square) and reminders to check out when alighting the tram) are also in English.

<p>There is a five line <b>metro</b>, including a short underground section in the city centre, that serves the neighbourhoods of the South East. It takes 15-20min from Centraal Station or Waterlooplein to the Bijlmer (Amsterdam Arena stadium, Heineken Music Hall and Pathe Arena cinema and IMAX).
</p><p>The fifth metro line, the north/south line opened in July 2018. This big project started in 2003 to build a new underground metro line to connect the north of Amsterdam with the south (the <i>Noord/Zuidlijn</i> or North/Southline). The project has proved somewhat of a disaster for the city government with big budget overruns and delays.

<p>There are several free <b>ferry</b> services across the IJ river, to Amsterdam North, the most frequent runs every 5min. They all leave from a new jetty on the northern (rear) side of Centraal Station. The nicest one is the 15min service to NDSM Werf, a funky up and coming industrial neighbourhood with a nice cafe-bar (IJkantine), restaurants (Noorderlicht &amp; Pllek) and the old sheds of the Dutch Shipbuilding Company. In addition, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.pannenkoekenboot.nl/amsterdam/">Pancake Boat (Pannekoekenboot)</a> sails many times each week from the NDSM Werf.

<p>A pleasant way to cover a lot of ground is to rent a <b>bicycle</b>. There is at least one bike for every one of the 870,000 people living in Amsterdam. The city is very, very bike-friendly, and there are separate bike lanes on most major streets. In the city centre, however, there is often not enough space for a bike lane, so cars and cyclists share narrow streets. 
</p><p>Cyclists do not have the right of way even though it might appear so when observing the typical Amsterdammer's cycling behaviour (see <a href="/en/Netherlands#Extra_legal_protection" title="Netherlands">Extra legal protection</a>). Be very careful to watch out for other cyclists. Always show other traffic where you're going (e.g., by holding out your hand) in order avoid accidents and smooth the traffic flow. If not indicated otherwise by signs, the right-before-left rule applies. Avoid getting your tyre in the tram rails; it's a nasty fall. Always cross tram rails at an angle. When crossing tram lanes, watch out for fast approaching taxis. They have a rather ruthless driving style. Let none of the above deter you from doing it the Amsterdam way. Be advised, however, that cycling the Amsterdam way takes a significant amount of skill: the locals have been riding bikes from the moment they could walk and this informs their behaviour. If you don't feel entirely comfortable on a bike, it may be a stressful affair rather than the smooth ride you may imagine it to be. On top of that, if your lack of confidence makes you block pathways used by other people who can skilfully manoeuvre along them (e.g. groups of people, between stationary vans and the rows of bollards dividing street and footpath), who have appointments to make and jobs to attend, it can create tensions between you and locals. If you don't feel entirely comfortable on a bike, walk! It's less stressful, and Amsterdam is so small the entire city centre can be navigated on foot within half an hour. 
</p><p>A good map for cycling (routes, repairs, rentals + also public transport) is <i>Amsterdam op de fiets</i> (a Cito-plan). When preparing a route, there's a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.routecraft.com/rlfplanneren">digital bicycle route-planner for Amsterdam</a>.
</p><p>Bicycles can be taken on all metros and tram 26 using the bike supplement fee (€1.70 in 2016, valid 1d) on the OV chipcard. Use the special bike racks, locations indicated by a bicycle sign on the outside of the carriage.
</p><p>Bicycles (and scooters) can be taken for free on all ferries across the IJ. From June 1st 2020 you have to wear a face mask at the ferries. 
</p><p>Make sure to get a good lock (or two), and to use it. Amsterdam has one of the highest bicycle theft rates in the world, see the <a href="/en/Netherlands#Bike_theft" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> page.  Note also that, if buying a bike, prices that seem too good to be true are stolen bikes. Any bike offered for sale to passers-by, on the street, is certainly stolen.  There's an old Amsterdam joke; When calling out to a large group of cyclists passing by; "Hey, that's my bike!" about five people will jump off "their" bikes and start running.
</p><p>If you are as good a cyclist as the locals, rent a bike! There are bike rental shops at stations, and several others in and around the city centre. Bikes cost about €9 to €20 per day. (Bring wet gear.)

<p>New guidelines were introduced in June 2013 to bring down the bad cab drivers. Many new companies were founded and bad companies failed. Amsterdam needed these guidelines to help the taxi branche.
</p><p>Try avoiding the taxi stands at Central station and Leidseplein. Some drivers, traditionally at Centraal Station or Leidseplein, will refuse short trips or will quote outrageously high fares, even though all taxis are metered. Even if you convince the driver to use the meter, he will often take a circuitous route that racks up €15 or more on the meter. For reference, no trip within the historic centre should cost more than €10 or so. If you want to avoid these circumstances try pre-booking at a company like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.deluxetaxiamsterdam.com">Deluxe Taxi Amsterdam</a>
</p><p>Regular taxi price have the following rates: Start: €2,95 per km: €2,17 per min: €0,36 (jun 2016) all taxis have a meter which will calculate the price. You can also go for a fixed rate but it's recommended to follow the meter if the right route has been taken by the driver you will pay as it should be.
</p><p>Unlicensed, illegal, cabbies operate mainly in Amsterdam Zuidoost, Leidseplein crossing Prinsengracht and at the Rembrandt Square. These aren't easily recognized as such, and most certainly don't drive Mercedes cars. They are known as <i>snorders</i> and most easily reached by mobile phone. Rides within Amsterdam Zuidoost (the Bijlmer) range from €2.50 to €5, whereas Zuidoost-Centre can run up to €12.50. Snorders have a bad reputation, so never consider their services.

<p>It is practical to use a <b>car</b> only outside of the historic centre; within the historic centre, the traveller is advised to stay with public transport. In Amsterdam, a car is generally a liability and not an asset. Use a car only if you are going to an obscure location many miles out that is not served by public transport.
</p><p>Driving around Amsterdam is a pain: many of the streets are narrow, the traffic (and parking) signs are baroque and obscure, and cyclists and pedestrians may get in your way. Plus, petrol is about 1.54€ to 1.7€ per litre. You can try parking at one of the secured parking garages, for example under Museumplein, or near the Central Station, and then walk around the city centre, or use a tram. Car parking is very expensive in Amsterdam and it's often hard to find a place to park. You can choose to pay by the hour or for the whole day. Parking is free outside the centre on Sunday.  There is always a spot available on the Albert Cuypstraat (which is a market during the rest of the week). From there, it is a 5 minute tram ride or 15 min walk downtown.
</p><p>Another option is to park your car further outside the city-centre. For 8€,- you get a full day (24 hr) of parking and a return ticket downtown. The ride takes about 15 minutes. Look for the P+R (Park and Ride) signs. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bereikbaaramsterdam.nl/live/main.asp?subsite_id=23">[12]</a>
</p><p>You can also park for free in some parts of Amsterdam outside the city centre though this may be slowly changing.  Parking is still free everywhere in Amsterdam-Noord, and you can just take the bus from the Mosplein stop to the city centre easily.  Plenty of buses run through here.
</p><p>Popular car rental chains operate in a smaller capacity in Amsterdam, including Avis and Budget Rent a Car. Most recently 'Car 2 Go' has all-electric Smart cars availible within and around the city.

<p>Amsterdam has one of the most extensive <b>historic city centres</b> in Europe, with about 7,000 registered historic buildings. The street pattern has been largely unchanged since the 19th century &#8212; there was no major bombing during World War II. The centre consists of 90 islands linked by 400 bridges, some of which are attractively floodlit at night.
</p><p>The inner part of the city centre, the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Old_Centre" title="Amsterdam/Old Centre">Old Centre</a>, dates from medieval times. The oldest streets are the Warmoesstraat and the Zeedijk located in the Nieuwmarkt area of the Old Centre. As buildings were made of wood in the Middle Ages, few buildings from the period have survived. Exceptions are two <b>medieval wooden houses</b> at Begijnhof 34 and Zeedijk 1. Other old houses are Warmoesstraat 83 (built around 1400), Warmoesstraat 5 (around 1500) and Begijnhof 2-3 (around 1425). The <b>Begijnhof</b> is a late-medieval enclosed courtyard with the houses of beguines, Roman Catholic women living in a semi-religious community. Beguines are found in Northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and north-western Germany. Number 34 Begijnhof is the oldest house in Amsterdam. Entry to the courtyard and surrounding gardens is free, but be careful not to disturb the community living here.
</p><p>One of the most prominent features is the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Canal_Ring" title="Amsterdam/Canal Ring">Canal Ring</a>, a concentric ring of canals built in the 17th century. The merchant-based oligarchy that ruled the trading city of Amsterdam built canal houses and mansions in the most prestigious locations here, especially along the main canals. Typical of the area are the traditional white draw bridges. The best example has to be the <b>Magere Brug</b> in the Canal Ring, which is over 300 years old and practically in its original state. It is a beautiful place to view the river and take in some traditional Dutch architecture. 
</p><p>The <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Jordaan" title="Amsterdam/Jordaan">Jordaan</a> was built around 1650 along with the Canal Ring, but not for the wealthy merchants. For a long time it was considered the lower class area of Amsterdam, and included some notorious slums. The name probably derives from the nickname 'Jordan' for the Prinsengracht. Apart from a few wider canals, the streets are narrow, in an incomplete grid pattern (as the grid followed the lines of the former polders located here in medieval times). This district is the best example of "gentrification" in the Netherlands, as recently it has been turned into a fashionable shopping district. 
</p><p>There are several <b>large warehouses</b> built originally with specific roles in mind. The biggest is the Admirality Arsenal (1656-1657), now the <b>Maritime Museum</b> (<i>Scheepvaartmuseum</i>) at Kattenburgerplein. Others include the former turf warehouses (1550) along the Nes, now the municipal pawn office; a similar warehouse at Waterlooplein 69-75 (Arsenaal, 1610), now an architectural academy, and the warehouse of the West India Company (1642) at the corner of Prins Hendrikkade and 's-Gravenhekje. The city office for architectural heritage, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.bma.amsterdam.nl/">BMA</a>, has an excellent online introduction to the architectural history and the types of historical buildings available. The website includes a <i>cycle route</i> along important examples. There are also several warehouse galleries in Amsterdam Noord, including Nieuw Dakota, a young gallery space for contemporary art. 
</p><p><b>Windmills</b> were not built in urban areas, since the surrounding buildings obstructed the wind too much. The Amsterdam windmills were all originally outside its city walls. There are a total of eight windmills in Amsterdam, and most of them are in <a href="/en/Amsterdam/West" title="Amsterdam/West">West</a>. However, the best one to visit is <b>De Gooyer</b>, which is not far from the city centre, and is used as a brewery open to visitors. The only windmill fully open to the public is the <b>Molen van Sloten</b> in Sloten, a former village now part of <a href="/en/Amsterdam/West" title="Amsterdam/West">West</a>.

<p>Since the Middle Ages and throughout the 17th century, the Netherlands was a country with a relatively high degree of freedom and tolerance towards other religions and cultures, especially compared to other countries in Europe. Between 1590 and 1800, the estimated foreign-born population was never less than 5 percent, many of them settling in Amsterdam. This led to a large diaspora of Jews, Huguenots (French protestants), Flemish, Poles and other peoples in the city. The Jewish people especially have always had a large presence in Amsterdam, notably in the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Old_Centre" title="Amsterdam/Old Centre">Old Jewish Quarter</a> (though this quarter has been in a status of decay since World War II). The most prominent synagogue is <b> The Esnoga</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.portugesesynagoge.nl/eng">[13]</a> (or <i>The Portuguese Synagogue</i>) , built in 1675 in an austere Classicist style.
</p><p>As the Netherlands was a protestant nation, most of the churches are from this branch of Christianity. Some of the most notable churches:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Oude Kerk</b> (1306) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.oudekerk.nl/">[14]</a> Located on the Oudezijds Voorburgwal, in the red-light district. The oldest of the five main churches in the historic centre. You can climb the tower from April to September on Saturday &amp; Sunday, every half-hour - but make sure you either do that early or stop by to book a climb in the morning, it could be sold out by the end of the day. Also open in the winter by group appointment (maximum 10 people) cost €70 per hour. (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#05646b6b6445677076666d6077286864696a6666642b6b69">mailto:<span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ee8f80808fae8c9b9d8d868b9cc3838f82818d8d8fc08082">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>) for more information.</li>
<li><b>Nieuwe Kerk</b> (15th century) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nieuwekerk.nl/en/index.htm">[15]</a> Located on Dam Square. Used for royal coronations, most recently the crowning of King Willem-Alexander in 2013, and royal weddings, most recently the wedding of crown prince Willem-Alexander to princess Máxima in 2002. Today, the church is no longer used for services but is now a popular exhibition space.</li>
<li><b>Zuiderkerk</b> (built 1603-1611) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.zuiderkerk.amsterdam.nl/">[16]</a> Located on Zuiderkerkhof ("Southern Graveyard") square. Now an information centre on housing and planning. You can visit the tower from April to September Monday to Saturday (with guide only) every half-hour, cost €6. Also open in the winter by group appointment (maximum 15 people) cost €70 per hr.

<li><b>Westerkerk</b> (built 1620-1631) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.westerkerk.nl/">[18]</a> Located on Westermarkt near the Anne Frank House. The church is open (free) for visitors from Monday to Friday, 11AM-3PM, from April to September. You can also climb the tower (with guide only) every half-hour, Mon to Saturday €7.50 (2013). This is 6-person-at-a-time journey, thus the amount of visitors per day is limited - make sure you do the climb (or book it) in early hours.

In good weather you can see all of Amsterdam, and as far as the coast.</li></ul>
<p>The late-medieval city also had smaller chapels such as the Sint Olofskapel (circa 1440) on Zeedijk, and convent chapels such as the Agnietenkapel on the Oudezijds Voorburgwal 231 (originally 1470), now the University of Amsterdam museum. Later churches included the Oosterkerk (1669) in the eastern islands, and the heavily restored Lutheran Church on the Singel (1671), now used by a hotel as a conference centre. Catholic churches were long forbidden, and built again only in the 19th-century: the most prominent is the Neo-Baroque Church of St. Nicholas (1887) opposite Central Station.
</p><p>Also, investigate some of the "hidden churches" found in Amsterdam, mainly Catholic churches that remained in activity following the Reformation. A prominent hidden church is <b>Ons' Lieve Heer op Solder</b> (Our Lord in the Attic Chapel)<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.opsolder.nl/eng/home.php">[19]</a> Well worth the visit. Two hidden churches still in use are the Begijnhofchapel <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.begijnhofamsterdam.nl/">[20]</a> near the Spui, and the Papegaaikerk <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nicolaas-parochie.nl/index.php?menu=3&amp;page=33">[21]</a> in the Kalverstreet (both Catholic).

<p>Amsterdam has an amazing collection of museums, ranging from masterpieces of art to porn, vodka and cannabis.  The most popular ones can get <i>very</i> crowded in the summer peak season, so it's worth exploring advance tickets or getting there off-peak (e.g. very early in the morning). Some of the quality museums that you can't miss:
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Amsterdam/South" title="Amsterdam/South">Rijksmuseum</a></b> — absolutely top-class museum that has a large collection of paintings from the Dutch Golden Age. Some artists you can't overlook are Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, Frans Hals and Jan Steen. The must-sees are Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's Milkmaid. The museum also boasts a substantial collection of Asian art.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Amsterdam/South" title="Amsterdam/South">Van Gogh Museum</a></b> — even someone with little knowledge of art must have heard about Vincent van Gogh, the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter whose work had a far-reaching influence on 20th century art for its vivid colours and emotional impact. This museum has the largest collection of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings in the world. A hint: you can book a ticket online and skip the cashier line.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/en/Amsterdam/Canal_Ring" title="Amsterdam/Canal Ring">Anne Frank House</a></b> — dedicated to Anne Frank, a Jewish girl who kept a diary while hiding from Nazi persecution in hidden rooms at the rear of the building (known as the <i>Achterhuis</i>). It's an exhibition on the life of Anne Frank, but also highlights other forms of persecution and discrimination. Don't forget the Anne Frank House has a limited capacity and it is hard to get entrance tickets. Since 2019, the only way to get a ticket for the Anne Frank House is online.</li></ul>
<p>The other museums are described in the district articles.
</p><p>The <b>Museum Card</b> (<i>Museumkaart</i>) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.museumkaart.nl">[22]</a> costs €64,90 (or €32.45 for those under 18 years old) which includes a €4.95 admin fee. It covers the cost of admission to over 400 museums across the Netherlands and you can buy it at most major museums. It is valid for an entire year for Dutch residents (visitors receive a 31-day temporary card), and you will need to write your name, birthday, and gender on it.  If you are going to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum, €17.50 and €15 respectively, this card can quickly pay for itself. Another advantage of having this card is that you can visit the same museum twice at no extra cost (for example Rijksmuseum is so huge you may want to spread it over two visits), or try out museums you're not sure you will like. The tickets to the major museums, including the audio guide, can be bought early from the tourist information desk at no extra cost. 
Alternatively, for short stays, you can consider buying the <i>Iamsterdam card'</i> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/iamsterdamcard">[23]</a>, starting at €42 per day, which includes "free" access to Amsterdam museums, public transport and discount on many tourist attractions.

<p>The locals spend their summer days in Amsterdam opening a red wine in the Vondelpark — and so should you. Every district in Amsterdam has at least one park, but the <b>Vondelpark</b> in <a href="/en/Amsterdam/South" title="Amsterdam/South">South</a> is notable for its size and convivial atmosphere. The neighbourhood best known for its greenery is the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Plantage" title="Amsterdam/Plantage">Plantage</a>. Besides its leafy boulevards and grand mansions, it also features the botanical gardens of the <b>Hortus Botanicus</b>. Finally, <b>Artis Zoo</b> is a good attraction for the kids.
</p><p>A more recent tradition is the opening of so-called city beaches. Yes, it's now possible to lie in the sand far from any natural coastline! Amsterdam has three of these beaches, which are located in <a href="/en/Amsterdam/West" title="Amsterdam/West">West</a>, <a href="/en/Amsterdam/East" title="Amsterdam/East">East</a> and <a href="/en/Amsterdam/South" title="Amsterdam/South">South</a>.

The Red Light District consists of several canals, and the side streets between them, south of Central Station and east of Damrak. Known as 'De Wallen' (the quays) in Dutch, because the canals were once part of the city defences (walls and moats). Prostitution itself is limited to certain streets, mainly side streets and alleys, but the district is considered to include the canals, and some adjoining streets (such as Warmoesstraat and Zeedijk). The whole area has a heavy police presence, and many security cameras. Nevertheless it is still a residential district and has many bars and restaurants, and also includes historic buildings and museums — this is the oldest part of the city. The oldest church in Amsterdam, the Netherlands-gothic <b>Oude Kerk</b> on the Oudezijds Voorburgwal at Oudekerksplein, is now surrounded by window prostitution. The area has many sex shops and peep show bars.This section of town is a common attraction for bachelors celebrating a stag night, if you ever get hassled, a firm and loud "Leave me alone" will work most of the time.

<p>Modern architecture is under-represented in Amsterdam (as opposed to <a href="/en/Rotterdam" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>), but as the outer districts were built in the 19th and 20th centuries, there is definitely some to be found. Immediately outside the Singelgracht (the former city moat) is a ring of 19th-century housing. The most prominent buildings from this period are the Central Station (1889) and the Rijksmuseum (1885), both by P. J. H. Cuypers. <a href="/en/Amsterdam/West" title="Amsterdam/West">Amsterdam West</a>, especially the neighbourhood De Baarsjes, was built in the Amsterdam School and New Objectivity architectural styles from the 19th century. A completely different approach to architecture has been the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Bijlmer" title="Amsterdam/Bijlmer">Bijlmer</a>, built in the 1970s and forseen as a town of the future for upper-middle class families. Large apartment buildings and relatively large rooms were combined with common grass fields and a separation of pedestrian and car traffic. It has been a revolutionary way of thinking in the architectural world, but eventually the neighborhood turned into a lower-class residential district home to people of over 150 nationalities, and it is often associated with crime and robberies. It has improved remarkably the last years though, and adventurous travelers might be interested to know more about the history of this bizarre district.
</p><p>Since there was little large-scale demolition in the historic centre, most 20th-century and recent architecture is outside it. The most prominent in architectural history are the residential complexes by architects of the <b>Amsterdam School</b>, for instance at Zaanstraat / Oostzaanstraat.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Museum of the Amsterdam School</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.hetschip.nl">[24]</a>. The best-known example of their architecture. Open Tuesday to Sunday 11AM to 5PM, entrance €7.50, includes 20 min. guided tour.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Eastern Docklands</b>. The largest concentration of new residential buildings. The zone includes three artificial islands: Borneo, Sporenburg, and KNSM/Java-island. The latter has been built as a postmodern interpretation of the old canal belt. Across from it, is the brand new Piet Heinkade, and some adjoining projects. Accessible by tram 10, tram 26 to Rietlandpark, or best of all by bicycle.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The largest concentration of box-like office buildings is in Amsterdam Zuid-Oost (South-East) around Bijlmer station (train and metro), but the area does have some spectacular buildings, such as the <b>Amsterdam ArenA stadium</b> and the new <b>Bijlmer ArenA station</b>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Amsterdam is replacing older sewage plants by a single modern plant, in the port zone. Connecting existing sewers to the new plant requires long main sewers, and the use of <b>sewage booster pumps</b> - a new technique at this scale. The new booster pump stations are a unique type of building, designed by separate architects. The three complete pumps are located at Klaprozenweg in the north, on Spaklerweg (just east of the A10 motorway), and beside and under Postjesweg, in the Rembrandtpark.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>EYE Film Institute</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.eyefilm.nl">[25]</a> is a futuristic building designed by Delugan Meissl Associated Architects and houses the film museum, cinema, shop and a good restaurant / cafe with a great view over the IJ river (IJ is also pronounced as eye). On the outside this white steel building reminds people of a bird, a plane or a space ship. On the inside it has modern design with a vintage feel and lots of wood, giving it a cozy vibe. A gem for architecture enthusiasts, photographers, film fans and foodies alike. Accessible by the frequent, free ferry from Central Station to 'Buiksloterweg' in only 5 minutes.</li></ul>

<p>Amsterdam is a cultural haven with year-round festivals for every pocket. 
At crowded festivals, watch out for pickpockets... 
</p>
<ul><li><b>January</b>
<ul><li><i>Realism Art Fair</i>: A lively art fair in one big hall of the Passenger Terminal Amsterdam, dedicated exclusively to figurative art.</li>
<li><i>Amsterdam International Fashion Week</i>: showing new fashion collections and a whole range of events like fashion photography exhibitions, museum exhibits about clothing, meetings of retailers and parties.</li></ul></li>

<li><b>April</b>
<ul><li><i>King's Day: (27 April, unless 27th falls on a Sunday, then it's 26 April)</i>: The national holiday, nominally in celebration of the King's birthday is hard to describe to anyone who's never been there. The city turns into one giant mass of orange-dressed people (Amsterdam locals, and another 1 million or so from throughout the country visit the parties in the city) with flea markets, bands playing, and many on-street parties, ranging from small cafes placing a few kegs of beer outside to huge open-air stages hosting world-famous DJ's. The Vondelpark is the place for children selling and performing. An experience you'll never forget. (BEWARE: it is VERY crowded on this day, so <i>mind your purse/wallet</i>. Also be aware that your cell phone will be useless for most of that day as the cell network is guaranteed to break down (for both voice and data) around noon and most of the afternoon. If you want to meet up with people, schedule things beforehand. If you do not like crowds, go out of the city.)</li></ul></li>
<li><b>May</b>
<ul><li><i>Taste of Amsterdam</i>: A culinary festival where you can explore the food of famous Amsterdam restaurants and their chefs.</li>
<li><i>Art Amsterdam</i>: a modern art fair in the RAI exhibition and conference centre. If you want to know what the latest developments are in Dutch galleries, this is where to find them all in one place.</li>
<li><i>Tulip festival</i>:Every year thousands of people come to see the tulip fields of the Noordoostpolder.  The tulip bulbs that were planted a few months ago, have now transformed acres of land into a colorful spectacle.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>June</b>
<ul><li><i>Holland Festival</i>: famous around the world, this Netherlands performing arts festival brings events from all over the world on the fields of music, opera, theatre and dance.</li>
<li><i>The Open Garden Days</i>: Normally you can see only the front of the canal houses, but during the Open Garden Days you get to go past the entrance and see the green world behind them, many times bigger than you would have expected.

One of the biggest festivals in Amsterdam with parties, performances, workshops and a boat parade on the Prinsengracht on Saturday afternoon which is always well worth seeing.</li>
<li><i>Prinsengracht concert</i>: third weekend of August each year. A free open-air classical music concert is held every year on a stage in the middle of the Prinsengracht canal. If you have a little boat, join the crowds and make sure to bring your rose wine or prosecco for full enjoyment.</li>

<p>Amsterdam is home to three universities, two of which offer summer courses and other short courses (with academic credits).
</p>
<ul><li><b>Vrije Universiteit (VU University)</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vu.nl">[51]</a>. Founded in 1880, the VU campus is located southwest of the city centre, and approximately 20 minutes away by bicycle. It is the only Protestant general university in the Netherlands.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Universiteit van Amsterdam</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.uva.nl">[52]</a>. Founded as the Athenaeum Illustre in 1632, in 1877 it became the University of Amsterdam.  With about 25,000 students, the UvA is on three separate campuses in the city centre, plus smaller sites scattered over Amsterdam.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The <b>Volksuniversiteit</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.volksuniversiteitamsterdam.nl/">[53]</a>. Despite the name, it is not a university, but a venerable institute for public education. Among the many courses are <b>Dutch language courses for foreigners</b>.</li></ul>

<p>Many people plan to move to Amsterdam for a year to relax before "settling down". This plan often falls apart at the job phase. Many people will find it difficult to get a suitable job, if they do not speak Dutch. However, hostels and hotels in Amsterdam may need bar staff, night porters etc, who speak English and other languages. There are also specialist websites for English and non-Dutch speakers looking to work in Amsterdam and they are a often a good place to start; Octagon Recruitment <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.octagon.nl">[54]</a> Blue Lynx - Employment by Language <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bluelynx.com">[55]</a>, Undutchables <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.undutchables.nl">[56]</a>, Unique and Xpat Jobs<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.xpatjobs.com">[57]</a> are all useful resources.
</p><p>Immigration matters are dealt with by the Immigration Service IND <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ind.nl/EN/index.asp">[58]</a>. Registration is done by both police and municipalities. Immigration policy is restrictive and deliberately bureaucratic. That is especially true for non-EU citizens.
</p><p>European Union citizens do not require a work permit. Australians, New Zealanders and Canadians are awarded a one year working-holiday visa. In general the <i>employer</i> must apply for work permits. Immigration is easier for "knowledge migrants" earning a gross annual salary of over €45,000 (over €33,000 for those under 30).
</p><p>If you are a citizen of another country within the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, or Norway, you are allowed to work in the Netherlands. If you are not a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, or Norway, you must meet specific conditions. For instance, you must have a work permit. Within the EU, EURES (European Employment Services Network) advocates for the interests of cross-border workers. Several Dutch employers, such as Uitzendbureau SkyHire <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.skyhire.nl/blog/uitzendbureau-skyhire-is-trotse-partner-van-eures">[59]</a>, are partners of EURES and promote cross-border employment. They assist you in organizing your employment documents and also inform you about everything you need to know, like housing market regulations, health care, and the tax authorities. EURES supports employers in this process."

<p>EURES, the European Employment Services Network, was established to facilitate the free movement of workers within the European Economic Area (EEA) countries and Switzerland. Founded in 1993, EURES provides information, advice, and recruitment/placement (job-matching) services for the benefit of workers and employers alike. The main goal of EURES is to offer its services to all citizens aiming to benefit from the principle of the free movement of persons.

<p>There are many flexible office solutions in Amsterdam that enable you to rent office space for a short term.

<p>The main <b>central shopping streets</b> run in a line from near Central Station to the Leidseplein: Nieuwendijk, Kalverstraat, Heiligeweg, Leidsestraat. The emphasis is on clothes/fashion, but there are plenty of other shops. They are not upmarket shopping streets, and the north end of Nieuwendijk is seedy. Amsterdam’s only upmarket shopping street is the P.C. Hooftstraat (near the Rijksmuseum). 
</p><p>Other concentrations of shops in the centre are Haarlemmerstraat / Haarlemmerdijk, Utrechtsestraat, Spiegelstraat (art/antiques), and around Nieuwmarkt. There is a concentration of Chinese shops at Zeedijk / Nieuwmarkt, but it is not a real Chinatown.
</p><p>The ‘interesting little shops’ are located in the side streets of the main canals (Prinsengracht / Keizersgracht / Herengracht), and especially in the <b>Jordaan</b> - bounded by Prinsengracht, Elandsgracht, Marnixstraat and Brouwersgracht. The partly gentrified neighbourhood of <b>De Pijp</b> - around Ferdinand Bolstraat and Sarphatipark - is often seen as a 'second Jordaan'.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Fashion &amp; Museum District</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fashion-museum.nl/shopping_tour_en.html">[63]</a>. Located in Amsterdam Zuid, this is considered the chic area for shopping in Amsterdam, close to the Museum district, the PC Hooftstraat and the Cornelis Schuytstraat have some of the finest designer shops in the city, including designer shoes, health and well-being specialists, massage, fashion boutiques, designer interiors, designer florists and specialist shops.</li></ul>
<p>In the older areas surrounding the centre, the main shopping streets are the Kinkerstraat, the Ferdinand Bolstraat, the Van Woustraat, and the Javastraat. The most <i>ethnic</i> shopping street in Amsterdam is the <b>Javastraat</b>. There are toy stores and clothing shops for <b>kids</b> in the centre, but most are in the shopping streets further out, because that's where families with children live.
</p><p>You can find <b>plus size</b> clothing in the centre of Amsterdam. C&amp;A, and H&amp;M are both on the main shopping streets from the Central station. A bit further from the city centre you can find Mateloos, Promiss, Ulla Popken as well as several stores by chain M&amp;S mode.
</p><p>A <i>give-away shop</i> can be found at Singel 267, open Tuesdays and Thursdays 17:00-19:00 and Saturdays 12:00-17:00.
</p><p>English-language books can mostly be found in the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Old_Centre" title="Amsterdam/Old Centre">Old Centre</a>. Large Dutch bookstores also carry a selection of foreign language books.
</p><p>A lot of shops aimed at tourists sell a certain kind of woolen hat with "AMSTERDAM" printed on it. Locals refer to this article as "the tourist hat" and wearing one will immediately mark you as a tourist, as no Dutch person would ever wear one. Buy one if you like it, but be aware of this if you want to simply blend in. If you lived in London, would you go around wearing a hat with your city's name on it?

<p>There is a large diversity of restaurants in Amsterdam, especially if you are looking for Asian cuisine, although much of it is tailored to the fairly bland local tastes and might not have the fire you would expect. The influence of the Dutch colonial past is apparent, as can be seen in the wide array of Indonesian restaurants.  
</p><p><b>Jordaan</b> Jordaan is for Amsterdam standards a geographically large neighborhood and offers a lot of options for dining, but particularly the Tweede Tuindwarsstraat and neighboring streets host a variety of lovely restaurants. La Perla is famous for its wood-oven pizzas, Burger Patio offers a chance for Mediterranean-style dining outside and La Oliva offers Cantabarian-Basque tapas. The first and only Afghan restaurant of the city, Mantoe, can be found on the Tweede Leliedwarsstraat.
</p><p><b>Nieuwmarkt</b> Most Asian restaurants are clustered at the Zeedijk in Nieuwmarkt, for this reason often dubbed as Amsterdam's Chinatown. It's also home to many <i>tokos</i>, small Asian grocery stores that sell Eastern food and spices. Indonesian restaurants are usually of excellent quality, but Indian ones can be expensive. Chinatown also offers plenty of Chinese, Thai and Japanese restaurants.  
</p><p><b>Damstraat</b> Is a fairly busy road filled with small and cheap Chinese and Middle Eastern restaurants - expect sticky tables, but it's definitely a good place for budget travellers. The numerous falafel bars have a good value, often sporting a "all you can pile" salad bar. 
</p><p><b>Nieuwezijds Kolk</b> Hosts a lot of Indian and Japanese restaurants and for instance an ice cream parlor Bakkerij van der Linde. Its officially a bakery, but they don't sell bread, but Amsterdam`s most famous whipped ice cream, lovely almond cookies and cakes. The texture is really creamy and soft, it melts easy and they put it in a cone with a soup spoon. A small ice cream costs 1 euro, a big one 2.
</p><p><b>Surinamese food</b> is widely available and worth a try. The highest concentration of Surinamese restaurants can be found in the South, especially in the <b>Albert Cuypstraat</b>. A good example can be found in Surinaams-Chinees Afhaalcentrum Albina at Albert Cuypstraat 69. It costs €6 and very good. If you arrive around dinnertime you probably have to wait for a table. The surroundings are depressing but the food is so good you will come back anyway. Locals recommend the roti with bone, the moksi meti, petjil and Bojo as dessert. Try the Dawet as well; this typical drink is made from milk, coconut milk and rose sirup and has sago balls in it (tastes like cough syrup). Most kids like it.
</p><p><b>Eetcafe'</b>s is Dutch for bars that serve evening and night time meals.
</p><p>Many restaurants of all kinds can be found in the <b>Haarlemmer Neighborhood</b> (north of Jordaan), and in the narrow streets crossing the two.
Also worth trying is the Van Woustraat in the Pijp, or continue to the Rijnstraat in the Rivierenbuurt. 
Exquisite but expensive restaurants can be found in the Utrechtsestraat.

<p><b>Local cheese</b> Buy some at the Albert Cuyp market, Dappermarket or at specialist cheese shops found around central Amsterdam. Dutch cheese is traditionally firm, and is made in large wax-covered wheels, and falls into two main categories - Young and Old. Within those categories, there exists a rich variety. Among the more unusual young cheeses is cumin (Komijn) cheese, which is particular to the Netherlands. Sheep (Schapen) and goat (Geiten) cheeses are also common. Old (Oud) cheese can be made of any sort of milk, and is often reminiscent of Italian parmesan in consistency and sharpness of flavour. 
</p><p><b>Ossenworst</b> A raw beef sausage with nice spices. Originally from Amsterdam.
</p><p>Amsterdam has several small local beer breweries, like <b>Brouwerij 't IJ</b>, <b>Bierfabriek</b>, <b>De Bekeerde Suster</b> and <b>De Prael</b>. They make very good beers. At Herengracht 90 you'll find <b>Proeflokaal Arendsnest</b>, serving a large collection of Dutch beers, including those from Amsterdam.  
</p><p>Also check out <b>bitterballen</b>, a kind of fried meatball, and the <b>kroketten</b> (the same, but shaped like a cylinder). Last but not least, don't forget to try a <b>traditional herring</b> or a <i>broodje haring</i> (herring sandwich), available from fish stalls around the city. Herring in Amsterdam is usually served with onions and pickles. A good try is the fish stand on the Koningsplein near the Flower Market. If you're visiting in late November or December, you can enjoy <b>oliebollen</b>, which are round blobs of sweet fried dough embedded with raisins (sultanas) and dusted with powdered sugar.

<p>You might consider avoiding some of the steak houses or fast food shops in the centre - they could be tourist traps. It is typically Dutch to eat fast food snacks from a coin-operated wall machine. Although the quality is generally good, do this at your own risk.

<p>All the bigger supermarkets are cheap and have all kinds of meals ready-to-eat. Don't expect any quality though. You'll find good food for a low price at the day markets, especially when they're almost closing at the end of the afternoon.
</p><p>For budget meal, check out also the various Falafel and Shoarma restaurants around the <b>Damstraat</b> and <b>Muntplein</b>. They usually include in the dish a large amount of salad. Lange Leidsedwarsstraat (just off Leidseplein) has about five Italian restaurants that sell pasta or pizza for €5.

Amsterdam's famously wild nightlife caters to all tastes and budgets.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bars_and_pubs">Bars and pubs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Amsterdam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=48" title="Edit section: Bars and pubs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The archetypical Amsterdam watering hole is the <i>bruine</i> ("brown bar" or "brown café"), a neighborhood pub of sorts with gorgeous dark wood  panelling &#8212; hence the name &#8212; and booths.  These do <i>not</i> sell cannabis, see <a href="#Coffeeshops">coffeeshops</a> below for that. Popular entertainment areas with lots of bars are the <b>Leidseplein</b> and <b>Rembrandtplein</b>.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nightclubs">Nightclubs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Amsterdam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=49" title="Edit section: Nightclubs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The nightclubs in Amsterdam are not as rough as one might think. Many nightclubs are grouped at <b>Leidseplein</b> and <b>Rembrandtplein</b> in the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Canal_Ring" title="Amsterdam/Canal Ring">Canal Ring</a>. As these two squares are also the typical tourist traps of Amsterdam, prices are relatively high and there are lots of scams. You can't go wrong at <b>Melkweg</b> and <b>Paradiso</b>, two live music venues that usually have a large queue in weekends. Paradiso has the best interior, as it used to be a church, while Melkweg feels more like a nightclub.  Jimmy Woo is an impressive VIP-room, but their dress code is very strict. There are also some nightclubs in <a href="/en/Amsterdam/East" title="Amsterdam/East">Eastern Amsterdam</a> (notably <b>Panama</b>) and near <a href="/en/Amsterdam/West" title="Amsterdam/West">Westerpark</a>. Techno/minimal lovers go to <b>De School</b> in the Jan van Breemenstraat, just outside the city centre (West). The club is a new initiative of the group that started "Trouw", the famous techno nightclub that was closed down in 2015.
</p><p>Amsterdam's <b>gay nightlife</b> is not what it used to be, but there is still an active community at the <b>Reguliersdwarsstraat</b> in the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Canal_Ring" title="Amsterdam/Canal Ring">Canal Ring</a> and at Club Church. The annual <b>gay pride</b> in August is a fun event that can be attended by gays and straights alike.

<p>Amsterdam is renowned for its liberal <b>drug policy</b>. Coffeeshops, not to be confused with coffeehouses or cafes, are allowed to sell <b>cannabis</b> and hash for personal use (not more than 5 grams). While <i>technically</i> still illegal, mostly to comply to international treaties, personal use of (soft) drugs are regulated by the Ministry of Justice under an official policy of <i>gedogen</i>; literally this means <i>to accept</i> or <i>tolerate</i>, legally it is a doctrine of non-prosecution on the basis that action taken would be so highly irregular as to constitute selective prosecution. The city council of Amsterdam allows coffeeshops to operate only with the provision of set, non-transferable licenses as shown by an official green and white sticker on the window of a coffeeshop. Coffeeshops are to sell only soft drugs (such as cannabis), selling of other drugs is not allowed. Also selling of dried hallucinogenic mushrooms is not allowed.
</p><p>That said, drug usage is increasingly being strictly controlled by the Dutch government. Garish advertising is not allowed (look for red-yellow-green rasta colors and the English word "coffeeshop"); no alcohol or edible cannabis products may be sold inside a coffeeshop; customers who want to smoke their weed mixed with tobacco are limited to special sealed 'smoking areas'; the amount of coffeeshops has decreased significantly since 1995; coffeeshops within a '250 meter school zone' have been closed down; and the usage of magic mushrooms has been forbidden since December 2008 (after two fatal incidents with foreign tourists).
</p><p>Still there are about 250 coffeeshops in Amsterdam, most of them in the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Old_Centre" title="Amsterdam/Old Centre">Old Centre</a>. Prices hover around €7.50 for 1 gram, with the average joint holding around 0.33g and a 5g/person sales limit.  Most coffeeshops are happy to recommend varieties and prepare your joint for you. Some offer vaporizers/inhalators for people who don't want to smoke.
</p><p>Using (soft) drugs is not allowed in public places, though in reality it will never be an issue. Just stay away from children's playgrounds and schools. Many coffeeshops offer a 'smoking lounge' where soft drugs may be used. Also note that despite the confusion on the subject, the Netherlands-wide smoking ban applies only to tobacco. However, since the Dutch commonly smoke tobacco mixed with their marijuana or hash, many coffeeshops, especially those unaccustomed to tourists, may require all smoking to be done in a separated smoking section or outdoors (this is far more common in coffeeshops outside of Amsterdam). Most central coffeeshops with large tourist clienteles will allow marijuana or hash smoking in their entire space, requiring you to smoke in the separated section only if your joint contains tobacco. Many coffeeshops also provide a non-tobacco herbal filler for those who find pure joints too strong. You may usually smoke joints containing this herbal filler anywhere within the coffeeshop although individual house rules may vary. If in doubt, always ask the staff.

<p>Amsterdam has over 400 registered hotels of varying standards from budget facilities to some of the most expensive hotels in Europe. Advance booking is recommended, especially for weekends and holidays. Don't expect you'll find an affordable bed once you're here. Most hotels and hostels can be found in the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Old_Centre" title="Amsterdam/Old Centre">Old Centre</a>, notably south of central station, and in the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/South" title="Amsterdam/South">South</a> around the Museum Quarter. Charming boutique accommodation can be found in the wealthy residential <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Canal_Ring" title="Amsterdam/Canal Ring">Canal Ring</a>, home to the rich and famous and its squares are the prime nightlife spots of the city. The <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Jordaan" title="Amsterdam/Jordaan">Jordaan</a> is another area for hip boutique accommodations, slightly upmarket, but still for mid-range prices. Some cheaper hostels can also be found in the <a href="/en/Amsterdam/Old_Centre" title="Amsterdam/Old Centre">Red Light District</a>.
</p><p>A simple bed in a <a href="/en/Hostel" class="mw-redirect" title="Hostel">hostel</a> starts around €15 on weekdays in the winter and up to €90 on a weekend in the summer. Hostels often expect you to book at least 2 nights in a weekend. A twin room in a budget hotel, 1-2 stars, might cost around €40 on weekdays in the winter and up to €100 on summer weekends. In a three and four star hotel, the prices would range from €100 to €200, depending on season, and five stars hotels can cost between €150 and €400 a night.
</p><p>Do not expect a wide amount of services from cheaper end hostels and hotels. Most of these do not have elevators and have the usual steep staircases; if you suffer from vertigo, do get an assurance that you will be getting a first or second floor room or book a hotel that has an elevator.
</p><p>Since the internet business started many Amsterdam visitors prefer book some hotels alternative such as holiday apartments and houseboats. There are several sites offering short term apartments. Here you can book your own apartment <b>Amsterdam Stay</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.amsterdamstay.com/apartments/">[68]</a>.

<p>You should take normal precautions against <a href="/en/Pickpockets" title="Pickpockets">pickpockets</a> and luggage theft, especially in the main shopping streets, onboard trams and trains, at stations, and anywhere where tourists congregate. Street begging is no longer common in Amsterdam, since the police take a harder line. Some beggars are addicts, some are homeless, and some are both.
</p><p>What looks like a footpath, especially along a canal bank, may be a bicycle lane. Bicycle lanes are normally marked by red/purple tiles or asphalt, and a bicycle icon on the ground. However, the colour fades over time, so you might miss the difference. Don't expect cyclists to be kind to pedestrians: some consider the pavement to be an extension of the road, to be used whenever it suits them. Never stay or walk on the bicycle path or street for extended periods of time, as you will be greeted only by angry bicycle bell ringing. Keep in mind that for many Amsterdammers, the bicycle is their main form of transport, they are not cycling for fun; but instead, to get to an appointment or their work on time. So be cautious. For the bike theft problem see above, <a href="#On_foot_and_bike">Get around</a>.
</p><p>Watch out for trams when crossing the street. Taxis are also permitted to use some tram lanes, and even if not allowed, they often use them.
</p><p>Groups of women visiting the Red Light District at night might feel harassed in the aggressive environment, though this is said to be the safest area because of the police presence. Keep to main streets and groups. If you do choose to visit the Red Light District, do not take photographs of prostitutes! You will be yelled at, or worse. There are even signs displayed there telling you not to take photographs.
</p><p>Although not really dangerous, women especially might want to avoid the narrow lane north of the Oude Kerk (Old Church) after dark as the atmosphere can be quite intimidating. If you would like to see the nightlife in action, visit as part of a guided tour; that way you will be much safer than if you were to visit alone.

</p><p>However, there are differences between the neighbourhoods. While it's filled with all types of people during the day, the <b>Red Light District</b> does attract seedier visitors and vagrants after sunset. But plenty of police too. Some visitors even describe the district as "Disneyland".

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cannabis_and_other_drugs">Cannabis and other drugs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Amsterdam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=55" title="Edit section: Cannabis and other drugs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>It cannot be denied that many tourists come to Amsterdam for the coffeeshops. <b>Coffeeshops</b> (in English but written as one word) sell only soft drugs such as marijuana and hash - asking for other drugs is pointless because coffeeshops are monitored closely by the authorities, and nothing will get them closed down faster than by having hard drugs for sale. 'Café' is the general name for a place licenced to sell alcohol, in other words; a bar.
</p><p>Quality varies. Coffeeshops aimed at tourists are more likely to have overpriced and poor quality products. A simple rule of thumb is: if the place looks good and well-kept chances are their wares will be good as well. Don't just enter a coffeeshop being overwhelmed that it's possible at all to buy and consume cannabis openly: be discerning as to the quality.
</p><p>There's a small chance you will be approached by people offering to sell you hard drugs in the street, especially as you are walking through the Red Light District. Ignoring them or simply a firm refusal is enough - they will not pester you. The selling of drugs in the street is illegal and often dangerous; moreover the drugs sold to strangers are usually fake. When they invite you to see the goods, they can lure you into a narrow street and rob you. 
</p><p>So-called <b>smartshops</b> do not sell any illegal products, but a range of dietary supplements, including 'herbal ecstasy' - a legal attempt at an ecstasy pill alternative is a complete waste of money and various more or less obscure psychedelic herbs and despite a change in the law, one type of magic mushrooms. 
</p><p>Do keep in mind that all hemp-related products (except the seeds) are still illegal. This can be confusing for most tourists, who do think hemp products are legal since they are sold in coffeeshops. Hemp products are not legal, rather they are "tolerated" under the Dutch Opium Act. Read more about the legalities in the article about the <a href="/en/Netherlands#Drugs" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. 
</p><p>Amsterdam plays host to the Cannabis Cup, the most important marijuana-related event in the world every year during the week of Thanksgiving. The Cannabis Cup is organized by High Times magazine, and offers both tourists and natives the chance to enjoy 5 days of consuming and judging marijuana in different forms. Participants are eligible to pay $199 in advance or €250 at the door to obtain a "judges pass", which allows entry to the event for all five days of the competition, admission to numerous concerts and seminars held during the event, the ability to vote on numerous awards that are handed out, and free bus tours to and from the event. Day passes are available for €30 for each day, and certain concerts sell tickets at the door provided they are not already sold out.

<p>If you bring a laptop, tablet or smartphone, many hotels in the city offer wifi free of charge for guests, but inform before making a booking. Plenty of coffee houses and cafés offer free wifi to their consuming guests.
</p><p>If you don't bring your own device you'll have a harder time finding internet access. Try the phone shops which cater for immigrant communities in the Netherlands. They usually have one or two terminals.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Telephone">Telephone</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Amsterdam&amp;action=edit&amp;section=58" title="Edit section: Telephone">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The telephone country code for the Netherlands is <b>31</b>, and Amsterdam's city code is <b>020</b>. You only need to dial the 0 if you're calling from within the Netherlands.
</p><p><b>Pay phones</b> are increasingly rare as most Dutch people have a mobile phone. That's why pay phones mostly cater to tourists and can be found around tourist areas, such as the central station. If making local calls from a pay phone, you will need a phone card (€5 minimum) as many green KPN telephone booths do not accept coins. blue/orange Telfort booths accept both coins and cards. The KPN booths are currently being replaced by newer models, which will accept coins again. There are very few public telephones on the streets or in public transport stations in the Netherlands. If you need to make a call and do not have access to a local phone or hotel phone, it is best to go to a call centre or use a calling service over the internet (like Skype, for example). Most payphones require phone cards which can be bought at post offices and some delis, although the cards are increasingly hard to find. Also, as in any area, some of the pay phones are scams. If you do need to use a payphone, call the free customer service number listed on the payphone first to make sure the phone is actually in service. When you call the customer service number listed on the phone, if you get a recorded message or 'number not in service' message in Dutch or English, then DON'T put your money or credit card into the phone. Phones run by BBG Communications, common in Europe and the U.S., have repeatedly been alleged to make fraudulent charges with credit cards used in their phone, for calls that were never made.
</p><p>If you really do need a pay phone, they can be found in groups of six near the main entrance of the Central Station.
</p><p>There are <b>phone shops</b> ('belwinkel') all over the city. Outside the city centre, they mostly serve immigrants calling their home country at cheap rates.
</p><p>If your smartphone breaks, there is a company <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.terello.nl"><b>Terello</b></a> that fixes phones on the spot. Within an hour they come to you to fix your phone.
</p><p>If you have a simlock-free European GSM mobile phone (suitable for GSM 900/1800 networks), consider buying a <b>prepaid simcard</b>. You can buy these in any electronics store, and they are often the same price as buying a KPN phonebooth card. Calling then is a lot cheaper than using pay phones, and you are mobile. When budgeting your trip, remember to take the price of the card itself into account. Providers will often list the prices of their plans online without the price of the sim too; while this makes sense for a resident of the Netherlands who already owns a sim, you may need to spend as much as €19 on the simcard itself. Sims can be bought at any size necessary. 
</p><p>For pre-paid dataplans, Lebara and Lyca Mobile have outlets at Schiphol Airport selling SIM cards (typically €10 for 150 to 120MB data plans). A list of pre-paid SIM providers can be found <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/The_Netherlands">here</a>.
