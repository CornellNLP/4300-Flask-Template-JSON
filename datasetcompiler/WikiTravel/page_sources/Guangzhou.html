<p><b>Guangzhou</b> or <b>Canton</b> (广州) , the capital of <a href="/en/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Guangdong Province</a>, is the third largest city in China after Beijing and Shanghai with a population of more than 12 million. Founded in 214 BC, the city has been a springboard for trading, cultural exchanges, many revolutions and reforms, making it an unavoidable stopover to understand what shapes the modern China.
</p>

<p>Guangzhou's isolation from the rest of 'typical China' by mountainous topography and early exposure to the outside world has resulted in its unique way of lifestyle, liberal ideas, distinctive cuisine and tremendous wealth. It is no surprise that Guangzhou is a cradle of many reforms and revolutions that changed the fate of China forever. Today Guangzhou still unveils many republic-era sights that help travelers understand modern Chinese history.
</p><p>Founded in 214 BC, this capital of the richest province is always a mix of new and old. It not only boasts some of the oldest temples in China, a millenarian-old park, an imperial tomb of a southern kingdom and complete preservation of colonial villas and church on Shamian, but it also serves as a showcase of futuristic architectures and autopilot metro on Zhujiang New Town. 
</p><p>Despite its vibrant sight-seeing resources, travelers usually come to Guangzhou to shop and eat. Guangzhou accommodates countless huge markets specializing in almost any made-in-china products, including Chinese tea, herbs, garments, watches, electronics and toys. You will be appalled to see the real prices of those China-made products and the profit your local shops earn by selling them. 
</p><p>Food is the centerpiece of life and Guangzhou has the country's largest number of restaurants per capita, which is the birthplace of what you call 'Chinese food' (Cantonese food) in the west. Here you can grab the authentic taste of sweet &amp; sour pork, wonton soup and dim-sum. Few travelers can leave the city hungry. 
</p><p>As busy as it sounds, you can easily escape the crowd. Just head to surrounding villages, in which some of them date back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279AD). Bird watching in Nansha Wetland, a 200-hectare stopover for migrant birds from as far as Seriba, can easily make for a peaceful day.

<p>Guangzhou is divided into ten districts. Among them, Yuexiu and Liwan, the cradle for the Cantonese culture, has been the city center since the imperial era. Tianhe, which was a farming village decades ago, has been constructed into a new business center with some biggest shopping malls and highest skyscrapers in the city. 
</p><p>For travelers, the most useful road is Zhongshan Road, a 9 KM long highway horizontally cutting through the downtown of Guangzhou. The highway is divided into 8 sections. From Zhongshan 6 Road (中山六路）to Zhongshan 8 Road (中山八路) it covers around 80% tourist attractions and all famous restaurants. This area is well connected by Metro Line 1 from Changshou Lu (長壽路), Chen Clan Academy (陈家祠), Ximenkou(西门口） to Gongyuanqian (公园前).

The celestials bestowed blessings on the land and offered the sheaves to the people of the city as a symbol of prosperity and abundance. After the celestials left, the rams turned into stone, and Guangzhou quickly developed into an affluent and influential city. Due to this legend, Guangzhou has gained several popular nicknames: <i>Yangcheng</i> (羊城; City of Rams), <i>Suicheng</i> (穗城; Sheaves of Rice City) and <i>Wuyangcheng</i> (五羊城; City of Five Rams). In addition, due to the abundance of flowers along the city's main thoroughfares, Guangzhou is often referred to as <i>Huacheng</i> (花城; City of Flowers).
</p><p>According to historical records, the city was built in 214BC and was known as <b>Panyu</b> (番禺). The name Guangzhou actually referred to the prefecture in which Panyu was located. As the city grew, the name Guangzhou was adopted for the city itself.
</p><p>As a major sea port, Guangzhou's history is full of color. In 786 the city was sacked by the Persians and in 1711 the British East India Company established a trading post here. In 1757, the government designated the city as the only port allowed business transactions with foreign nations. This continued until 1842, the signing of the Treaty of Nanking, when four other ports were added. Losing the exclusive privilege pushed Guangzhou to become more industrialized later.
</p><p>Guangzhou was also part of the so called "Maritime Silk Road" that linked southern China with India, South-East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As a result of its links with the Middle East, a mosque was established in the city in 627, and a small Muslim community continues to live in Guangzhou to this day. Additionally, the sixth patriarch of Zen Buddhism was born in Guangzhou and taught the famous Platform Sutra in the city. As a result, Guangzhou has retained a strong connection with this school of Buddhism, and the monastery where the sixth patriarch studied is considered a local treasure. The first Protestant missionary in China, Robert Morrison, entered Guangzhou in 1807.

<p>Guangzhou has a humid subtropical climate, influenced by the East Asian Monsoon, with plenty of rainfall throughout the year, measuring 1.736mm on average. Extremes have ranged from 0°C (32°F) to 39°C (102°F). Winters are mild with the average temperature in January being 13.9°C (57°F). Cold weather is virtually unknown in Guanghzou since the cold air masses originating in <a href="/en/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> don't make it this far south and are blocked by the mountains in the north. Small portions of them however, may manage to penetrate through the mountains and reach the city, pushing low temperatures down to 5°C (41°F), but very rarely below, although due to the strong cold winds and humid weather, it does feel very chilly, while Snowfall is extremely rare, with the last occurence being in 24th January 2016, 87 years after the previous one. Summers, like the rest of southern <a href="/en/China" title="China">China</a> are hot and very humid. The heat is sweltering, due to the fact that the average high temperature in July is 32°C (90°F) and the average humidity is 82%, making the atmosphere very unpleasant. Daytime highs may surpass 35°C (95°F) up on occasion. October and November are inarguably the best months to visit Guanghzou and most of rain falls between April and September.

</p><p>Foreign nationals from 51 countries who transit through Guangzhou Airport when flying between two different countries (for example, London-Guangzhou-Auckland) qualify for a <b>72-hour visa-free stopover</b>. For the purpose of the policy, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan are treated as international flights (for example, London-Guangzhou-Taipei would qualify). The name of the policy is a bit of a misnomer, as the 72 hour period actually begins at 00:01 after the day of arrival (for example, if you arrive in Guangzhou Airport at 09:00 on 1 January, you can stay until 23:59 on 4 January). During the 72 hour visa-free stopover, you are allowed to move freely within the whole of <a href="/en/Guangdong" title="Guangdong">Guangdong</a> Province, but you must fly into and fly out of Guangzhou Airport. For details, visit the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.gdcrj.com/bszn/wgrcrj/wgrlhgl/mqzc/201308/t20130802_27060.htm">FAQs webpage (in English)</a> of the official government website of the Guangdong Province Division of Exit &amp; Entry Administration.
</p><p>Warning: Immigration at Guangzhou has denied 72-hour visa-free stopovers for those with Turkish stamps in their passport. Those with less than 8 hours between flights are also regularly denied entry - despite rules to the contrary. If you plan on enjoying an extended stay in Guangzhou under the visa-free system you are taking a risk.
</p><p>If you are flying on China Southern Airlines and have a stopover in Guangzhou, you may qualify for complimentary hotel accommodation. For details, visit the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.csair.com/cn/czadscale/2015/20150603/20160927.html?WT.inner_id=gzfs150603en">China Southern website</a>.
</p><p>The food in the international transfer terminal is very expensive. You can pay US$10 plus for a cup of tea! It is recommended to bring everything you will need for your layover. There is a free hot water machine downstairs, next to one of the smoking lounges. If you bring a mug, and some tea bags, you will be good to go for hours.
</p><p>The airport is 28 km (17 mi) north from central Guangzhou. The most convenient way into the city is by Metro Line 3. The lower level of the airport terminal leads to the Airport South Metro station. A journey to the East Railway Station, or to Tiyu Xilu Metro station (both ¥12) takes about 50 minutes. Trains run every seven minutes, with the first train leaving the airport at 6AM and the last train from and to the airport departing at 11PM.
</p><p>Taxis are also available and take about the same time as the Metro. A taxi ride to central Guangzhou will cost about ¥120, inclusive of a ¥15 toll fee. Taxi stations are available outside Arrival Hall Section A Gate 5 and Arrival Hall Section B Gate 6. If you arrive after midnight when the metro has stopped running, be prepared for a real long wait in line for taxis. Waiting times can start from 45 mins, not because of the lack of taxis, but because of the sheer number of arrivees. Also, do not be surprised that the queue is not really an orderly queue, which is quintessentially chinese. Some parts it's 2 people, some parts it's 4, and towards the front it can spread out to 8 in a row. People will attempt to out squeeze you to the back at every opportunity possible. You may find yourself 10 spaces behind the person who started right behind you.

If you have more than one piece of luggage or if a line has a stop at your hotel, this may be your top choice. Line 1 (¥16) departs every 10-15 minutes from 7AM until the last flight and takes 45 minutes to reach the Guangzhou Railway Station and Central Hotel. The ticket prices range from ¥10-55. Lines 1 to 6 are traveling within the metropolitan area, while lines 7-11 go to outer districts. There are also direct Airport Express buses to some cities in the <a href="/en/Pearl_River_Delta" title="Pearl River Delta">Pearl River Delta region</a>, such as <a href="/en/Zhuhai" title="Zhuhai">Zhuhai</a> and <a href="/en/Foshan" title="Foshan">Foshan</a>. However, there is no direct bus to Macau or Hong Kong.
</p><p>Do not accept solicitations for rides to the city. Sometimes, people will stand at the arrival area and ask if you need a taxi. These are illegally operated and use unmarked vehicles, or charge you a fee, offer you a phony receipt, and then arrange a taxi that will still charge you. They usually cost a lot more than licensed taxis since many travelers do not know the cost of airport transportation.
</p><p>Flying to/from <b>Hong Kong International Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>HKG</b>) is another option. From Hong Kong International Airport, you can take cross-boundary coach to Guangzhou and other cities in Guangdong. Service providers include China Travel Service, Trans-Island Chinalink and Eternal East. Fares range from HK$220-250 one way.

<p>Public transportation system is comprehensive in Guangzhou like most other big Chinese cities.  If you stay in Guangzhou for long time, purchase a multi-purpose <b>Ling Nan Tong - Yang Cheng Tong</b> (岭南通-羊城通) stored value card, which can be used to pay fares in metro, bus and ferries and used for many convenience stores, public phones and vending machines.  
</p><p>However, to return the card at the end of the trip, you need to go Gongyuanqian (Exit J) and Tiyu Xi Exit G, and East Railway Station. (Exit HJ). It may be worth simply keeping the card as a souvenir.

<p>Despite the sheer size of the city, walking is a great way of exploring the traditional Liwan and Yuexiu districts. The easy tour is to walk through Zhongshan 6 Road (中山六路, Zhongshan Liulu) which covers most tourist attractions including Liurong Temple, Guangxiao Temple, Huaisheng Mosque and many huge markets. It also has the two most popular pedestrian streets , Beijing Lu and Shang-xia-jiu for shopping mania. 
</p><p>To give you some sense of direction whenever you get lost, figure out the location of two major horizontal lines, which are Zhongshan Road and the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang) , you will easily tell every direction. This area is also well connected by Metro Line 1 and Trolleybus 104, 107, 109 and 78(Night Bus) which is the only trackless tram system in South China.

<p>Bicycles are promoted as a low-carbon mode of transportation. Over 100 rental outlets are now available along many BRT lines and subway stations. The rental fee is by the hour and up to ¥30 a day. One popular bike route is along the Pearl River on the Haizhu District side. Other dedicated bike lanes are slowly appearing in the city center, including Tianhe District. Yangchengtong Card is accepted in many public rental outlets.
</p><p>New bikes are available in major hypermarkets from ¥500 for a reasonable cheap single-speed to around ¥2000-3000 for a 21-speed mountain bike. Giant and Merida are the two most common international brands. High-end bicycles are also available to affluent customers in this rich city.
</p><p>You will see brightly colored shared bikes almost anywhere nowadays. In order to rent these, you must create an account with their respective APPs, including passport number and WeChat/AliPay/Chinese bank card. The most popular in Guangzhou are Mobike, Ofo, Bluegogo, and Xiaoming. After paying a deposit between ¥50-200, each half hour is generally ¥0.5-¥1.
</p><p>Folding bikes are permitted on the subway (sometimes not on buses) and tax, but non-folders are not permitted on any form of public transport other than the cross-river ferries. Bicycles are not permitted to cross the river via the Zhujiang Tunnel or Zhujiang suspension bridge, but are permitted to go on the public ferries for ¥1 (see below).

<p>Opened in 1999, the ever-growing Guangzhou <b>Metro system</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gzmtr.com/en/">[4]</a> covers much of the city center. The fare ranges from ¥2 to ¥12. Most of the signs and announcements are in Chinese and English. 
</p><p>If you stay in Guangzhou for extended period, think of getting a Yang Cheng Tong transportation cards (see details above). Card holders can get 40% off on any rides since the 16th uses in every month. 
</p><p>There are currently 8 lines in operation:-
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Central_Lines">Central Lines</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Guangzhou&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Central Lines">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p><b>Line 1</b> is the most useful for tourists, horizontally cutting through the center of Guangzhou. Five major stations Huangsha, Changshuo Lu, Chen Clan's Academy, Ximenkou, Gongyuanqian cover up to 80% tourist sights. 
</p><p><b>Line 2</b> runs horizontally through Guangzhou South Station and Yuexiu Park.
</p><p><b>Line 3</b> is a Y-shaped eastern Guangzhou. The 'main line' runs from Panyu Square to the Tianhe Intercity Coach Station, whilst the 'branch line' splits off at Tiyu Xilu and heads towards Airport South.
</p><p><b>Line 5</b> runs east-west from Jiaokou (Liwan District) to Wenchong (Huangpu District) and follows the inner ring road through the city. Useful for reaching Guangzhou Railway Station, the Garden Hotel and Zhujiang New Town.
</p>

<p><b>Line 4</b> serves Guangzhou's eastern outer suburbs and runs from Huangcun in Huangpu District down to Jinzhou in Nansha. This line is most useful for reaching the Olympic Sport Centre and the University Town.
</p><p><b>Line 8</b> was formed out of the remnants of Line 2 following it's southward extension and runs east-west through Haizhu District from Fenghuang Xincun to Wanshengwei. Useful for reaching Sun Yat-sen University and Pazhou Exhibition Centre.
</p><p><b>Zhujiang New Town APM</b> is an experimental autopilot metro system which takes you to the Canton Tower.  You need a separate 2yuan ticket to get a ride. 
</p><p><b>Guangfo Line</b> is China's first intercity railway, connecting downtown Foshan with Xilang, where you can transfer to Line 1. Central Foshan can be reached in approximately 45-60 minutes from central Guangzhou. Transfers from GZ metro lines and Yangchengtong cards are accepted.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_bus_2">By bus</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Guangzhou&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16" title="Edit section: By bus">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Guangzhou bus network is comprehensive. Bus fares are ¥2 for adults and ¥1 for children, disables and senior citizens. However, information at bus stops is mostly written in Chinese characters. A current stop's name may be displayed in pinyin or English on a LED display panel as long as it is available. On-board announcements are made in Mandarin, Cantonese and mostly English as well. 
</p><p>Buses are only handy for traveling within one district or for reaching suburban districts that are not served by the subway. Heavy traffic can lead to a slow, uncomfortable journey although they can be handy for a cheap but slow sightseeing tour. Trolley bus lines (Routes 101-109) are handy for exploring Liwan and Yuexiu districts. 
</p><p>Most bus routes run from around 6am to 10 or 11pm, after which there are night buses with the prefix 'Ye’ (夜, night). Night route numbers are not related to the normal route numbers. The fare is usually ¥3 - ¥4. There are more than 100 night routes, but most of them stop running in between 12:00 to 1:30am, and some start again around 5am. In most cases, taking a taxi after midnight and before the sunrise is a better idea.
</p><p>Guangzhou has over 30 commuter express bus lines (高峰快线) run mostly during peak hours from major bus and subway interchanges to congested areas and outlying districts. Fares are from ¥1-4. There are also four special lines for University Town (大学城专线). You can find these in most major stations in the city that would take you to University Town. Fares are from ¥2-4. There are also 2 tourist bus lines (旅游专线) passing through many scenic spots in the city. Other special lines are: Lines to some commercial districts, shuttle buses for many different residential complexes such as Favourview Palace and Star River, and even complementary shuttle buses for some shopping center. The driver of a shuttle bus may ask for your receipts.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_BRT">By BRT</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Guangzhou&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17" title="Edit section: By BRT">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The Bus Rapid Transit system went into service in early 2010. It is essentially a long segregated bus lane (not an elevated busway like in Xiamen) running along the Tianhe Road and Zhongshan Avenue corridor towards the eastern suburbs. Some intersections are traversed by bridges and tunnels, which cuts journey times considerably, but other intersections have traffic lights and therefore traffic jams, and crowds can be as dense as in Metro stations but with fewer doors and a narrower standing area compared to Metro trains.
</p><p>All buses that use the BRT start with a B prefix (B1, B22 etc.), though some without the "B" stop nearby. When reading a bus route (in Chinese) you can see the BRT logo above each BRT station name, like the GZ Metro logo above bus stops that are near Metro stations. The B1 stops at every BRT station, but other B routes use any number of BRT stations (sometimes just one) and use normal roads the rest of the time.
</p><p>If boarding a BRT bus at a normal (non BRT) bus stop, the normal fare of ¥2 applies, however you can transfer to other BRT routes for free, provided you transfer at a BRT stop. If boarding at a BRT stop, insert ¥2 (coins only) into the entry turnstile to enter the platform area; no payment is required when boarding the bus, and you can board at the rear.
</p><p>As with normal bus routes, there is almost no English at BRT stations, and only the current station name is in pinyin. Overall it isn't much use to tourists.

<p>This is the most popular way for foreigners to get around, and it is very affordable. The starting charge is ¥10 for the first 2.6 kilometres, and after that ¥2.6 for each kilometre. No fuel surcharge is added, but a 50% surcharge is automatically added when the trip reaches 35 kilometres. A few of them also accepts Yang Cheng Tong as payment, but it is not preferred by the drivers. The taxi hotline is 96900. This comes in handy if you forget your valuables in a taxi. <b>Save your receipt because it contains the taxi's identification number.</b>
</p><p>Most taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign languages, so have the name and address of your destination written in Chinese to show the driver. Many are from the poorer northern provinces and do not even speak Cantonese. If your destination is not well known, have a nearby landmark included in the address, e.g. "across from the Garden Hotel."
</p><p>Whilst the majority of taxis are the regular VWs and Hyundais found in almost all Chinese cities, there are an increasing number of 'London taxis' on the streets of Guangzhou (which comes as no surprise as the latest generation of London black cabs are built by Geely Motors in China). In Guangzhou they are known as "old-fashioned" cabs (老爷车，<i>lao ye che</i>) They are wheelchair accessible and can carry up to 6 passengers. Many people recommend using the yellow taxis as that company only employs local Guangzhou drivers who know the city well - other taxi companies usually hire migrant workers from other provinces who may not know where they are going.
</p><p>Beware of taxi driver as sometimes, in addition to going around the block one too many times, they will also try to pass counterfeit notes. Pay close attention as to what they pay when passing toll booths. Good drivers will show you the toll receipts. Only add the toll amount to what is displayed in the meter. A trip between the airport to the East Railway Station cost around ¥120-130.
</p><p>Most people find taxi drivers in Guangzhou to be honest. However, during the Canton Fair near the Pazhou Complex, it is common to see drivers violate rules, such as refusal of service and pre-negotiating a price rather than using the meter. It is also difficult to find a taxi available elsewhere in the city.
</p><p>Most taxi shift changes take place between 15:00-17:00. During this time, it is hard to find a taxi as many drivers stop working by displaying the "out of service (暂停服务)" sign before the end of the shift, unless you are going in their direction. Taxi can be also hard to come by during commuter peak hours of 19:30-09:00 and 17:00-19:00. Finding a taxi at night is usually not a problem.
</p><p>Uber has no presence in Guangzhou. However, there is a local service provider called "DiDi". It operates similarly to Uber and has an app in English which becomes very helpful for the expat community. Payment could be done through multiple ways including international credit cards and WeChat (international credit card could also be added here too but a WeChat account is needed). The prices are very cheap compared to other countries and is generally safe and reliable.

<p>Although a convenient way to navigate the city's back alleys and lanes, motorcycles are banned in the city center, and riding a motorcycle into these prohibited areas can lead to fines and possible confiscation of the bike. In addition to the central motorcycle ban, electric bicycles are banned from the city roads.

<p>The ferry is the cheapest way of crossing the Pearl River (Zhujiang). They were very popular in the 1980s and early 90s, carrying tens of thousands of passengers across the river each day. Nowadays its popularity declines greatly, mostly because of the construction of many bridges along the Pearl River and the availability of other public transportation. The river narrows while going through the city center (a bit wider than the Thames in central London). It is usually faster and more convenient to use the bridges or public transport(metro, bus) to cross the river than wait for the ferries. One ferry route that maintains its popularity operates between the <b>Huangsha Pier</b> by the seafood market next to Shamian Island and <b>Fangcun Pier</b>, the pier on Bai-e-tan Bar Street (Changdi Road) in Fangcun. It departs every 10 minutes from 6AM to 10PM. The fare is ¥0.5 for a foot passenger or ¥1 if you bring a bicycle. The fare can be paid in cash (no change given) or by using Yangchengtong Card. There are separate boarding gates for cyclists and pedestrians, and you pay at the boarding gate.
</p><p>Another popular and scenic route is called Waterbus (水上巴士), which travels down the river from Huangsha Pier to Canton Tower making a few stops along the way on both side of the river, shown as follow. Ticket price is ¥2, payable with cash or Yangchengton transportation card. <b>This waterbus only runs during the day before 6:00 pm.</b>
</p><p><b>Huangsha Pier(黄沙码头) -- Xidi Pier(西堤码头) -- Tianzi Pier(天字码头) -- Da Yuan Shuai Fu(大元帅府码头) -- Sun Yat San University North(中大码头) -- Canton Tower(广州塔码头)</b>
</p><p>There is another ferry connecting Canton Tower with <b>Hai Xin Sha (海心沙)</b>, located immediately across the Pearl River, providing another scenic way to cross the Pearl River. Ticket price is ¥2, payable with cash or Yangchengton transportation card. <b>This ferry only runs during the day before 6:00 pm.</b>

<p>Mandarin is the official language as is spoken by everyone other than some of the older generation. All true Guangzhou locals speak Cantonese, and if you visit areas such as Liwan and Yuexiu, this is the predominant language spoken on the street. Migrants from other parts of China will speak Mandarin. Local people take the preservation of their dialect so seriously that they even marched to the government office to protest against a plan to limit the use of Cantonese in TV and radio broadcasting. 
</p><p>English is spoken by more people than in the rest of China (save for Beijing and Shanghai), but still not by the majority, so it is a good idea to carry your hotel's business card with you. <i>Do not expect drivers to speak English</i>, some of them can't even speak Mandarin without a heavy accent. To save yourself the hassle and agony when asking for directions, have names of your destinations clearly written down in Chinese by the hotel staff before venturing out. That said, many educated younger people will have a basic knowledge of English and staff at hotels as well as bars and restaurants widely visited by foreigners generally speak an acceptable level of English. Staffs at Starbucks generally speak acceptable English and high school or college students can generally understand basic English as well, but not for speaking. If you find a Chinese people on the street who speaks English fluently, then you most likely run into either someone working at a foreign company, a highly educated student or a person who has studied abroad.
</p><p>Despite the fact that not the majority of people speak English, but the signs are often in Chinese and English, even though sometimes the English version doesn't really make any sense or obviously translated by google.

Tickets for the deluxe dinner cruise can be bought from most high-end hotels. Prices from ¥50-¥200 per person. Higher-end cruises usually include a dinner buffet.</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Public buses.</b></li></ul>
<dl><dd>Cheap and safe. The electric trams are even cheaper at flat rate of &#165;2.  Hop on to any one of the public buses. Drivers are generally very friendly and helpful. So long as you have sufficient small change for the journey, tell the driver you are in just for a joyride. (In cantonese Yau Cheh Hor literally meaning just for the ride or just for fun. Where the journey terminates, ask anyone what buses will take you back and request the driver to let you know when to get off. So long as you sit not too far away, he (sometimes she) will tell you. Don't worry, everyone is very helpful on these buses. Being paranoid about scams and perceived crimes takes the joy out of what would otherwise be a marvellous holiday.</dd></dl>

<ul><li><b>Dragon Boat Festival</b> (端午节 <i>duān-wǔ-jié</i>) on fifth day of fifth lunar month, usually in May or June.

The highlights are dragon boat racing along the Pearl River, and eating rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves (粽子).</li>
<li><b>Mid-autumn Festival</b> (中秋节 <i>zhōng-qiū-jié</i>) is on the 15th day of 8th lunar month, usually in September or October. Cantonese moon cakes are enjoyed during this holiday. Lian Xiang Lou and Taotao Ju's moon cakes are especially famous (see "Eat" section). Kids' favorites are paper lanterns. Many locals also enjoy riding ferries and watching the full moon on the Pearl River.</li>
<li><b>Tomb Sweeping Day</b> (清明节 <i>qīng-míng-jié</i>) is around the spring equinox, usually on April 5th. Involves visits to the family tombs for cleaning and making offerings.</li>

<li><b>Qi Xi</b>, or <b>Chinese Valentine's Day</b> (七夕 <i>qī-xī</i>) is on 7th day of 7th lunar month, usually in August or September. According to legend, a heavenly fairy Zhinu (织女) fell in love with a mortal farm boy Niulang (牛郎). This was forbidden; as punishment, they were only allowed to meet once a year on this day. There are usually parades and carnivals in the city celebrating the holiday. This is the Chinese equivalent of Valentine's Day, but it is steadily losing its appeal among the locals; many have adopted the Western Valentine’s Day on February 14th.</li>
<li><b>Winter Solstice</b> (冬至, 过冬 <i>dōng-zhì</i>), which literally means the Coming of Winter is on December 22nd. Traditionally, Cantonese people observe the day with a family feast, which often includes preserved duck and sausages.

<p>Cantonese cuisine is well-known for its blend of color, fragrance, taste and presentation, and it is ranked among the top four in the country. In particular, <i>dim sum</i>, a delicate pastry, is famous for being simple yet delicious. Local customs, as well as a long history of contact with the West compared to other regions in China, have played a major role in the development and diversity of Cantonese cuisine. Chinese food served in Western countries is usually Cantonese food, albeit slightly adapted to Western tastes, meaning that most Western visitors from large cities will be familiar with Cantonese food to a certain extent. That being said, authentic Cantonese cuisine is also famous throughout China for another reason - Cantonese people eat <b>absolutely anything</b>, and it is often said that Cantonese people eat anything that has four legs other than a table, anything that flies other than an airplane, and anything that swims other than a submarine. In addition to that, various internal organs of animals are regularly eaten, such as the liver, kidneys, heart and even brain. This means that Cantonese cuisine is one of, if not the most adventurous in China due to their expansive use of exotic ingredients, and their extremely broad definition of what is considered edible. This is how Guangzhou earned the distinct name of "Eating in Guangzhou (食在广州)."

<p>When it comes to drinks, Guangzhou is one of the best cities in China to knock back a few. With a relatively large population of foreigners here, the city offers a wide variety of nightspots that cater to all tastes.
</p><p>Tsing Tao and Zhu Jiang are the two major Chinese beer brands that are sold almost everywhere. Both are fairly standard light lagers. Carlsberg is also brewed in Guangzhou, which explains the reasonably large amount of Carlsberg taps in the bars.

<p>Guangzhou is not as well known as Beijing or Shanghai as a hub of foreign commerce and trade - perhaps unfairly, as it's the center of manufacturing in China. Most people on the planet are no further than a few feet away from an object produced in in the Guangzhou metropolitan area at any given time. This includes the components of the screen you're reading this on.
</p><p>While there may not be as many opportunities for foreigners here compared to Beijing or Shanghai, this massive city and its rapidly growing economy does offer some work for foreigners - management, translation, engineering and teaching English. There are a number of large ESL school chains, owned by foreigners, in the area who hire (mainly) North American teachers. As with any rapidly growing industry, there are many sketchy companies trying to make a buck. If you want to work as an English teacher in Guangzhou - which can be an amazing experience - make sure to verify the credentials of the school.
</p><p>English teaching jobs are available teaching a range of ages from kindergarten to elementary, middle and high school students as well as universities and private language centers. Schools usually require native speakers with a degree in any discipline and TEFL certificate.

<p>Violent crimes are not common. As one of the first open ports in China, Guangzhou is known for its liberalism and general tolerance of cultural differences. Crimes that target foreigners are rarely heard of but <a href="/en/Pickpockets" title="Pickpockets">pickpockets</a> could happen in shopping areas and transportation hubs. Teahouse scams, which are serious problems in Beijing and Shanghai, have not been reported in Guangzhou. 
</p><p>A possible scam is when a taxi driver refuses your notes and tells you it is fake. What happens is that the taxi driver changes your note for a fake one without you noticing. Always be suspicious when a vendor refuses your money and gives it back to you. 
</p><p>As the third wealthiest province of China, it has attracted enormous immigrant workers both from other provinces and overseas. The local police has Arabic- and English-speaking forces to deal with the rising drug trade involved with foreigners, who are not exempted from the death penalty for drug trafficking.
</p><p>Traffic conditions in Guangzhou have drastically improved in recent years and rules are practiced - <i>relatively</i>. However, like everywhere else in China, cars do not yield to pedestrians and zebra crossings are for display only.
</p><p>Emergency numbers are: Police: 110; Fire: 119; Medical: 120; Traffic accident: 122.
