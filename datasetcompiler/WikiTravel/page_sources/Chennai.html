<p><b>Chennai</b> (Tamil:சென்னை) was formerly known as <b>Madras</b>. In 1996, the Tamilnadu government officially renamed Madras to Chennai to reflect the original pre-colonial name of the region "Chennapatinam". The city of Chennai is coterminous with Chennai district, which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the Chennai Metropolitan Area.

<p>The region around Chennai has served as an important administrative, military and economic centre for centuries. The modern city of Chennai has its origins as Madras which was founded in 1639 by the English East India Company (represented by Francis Day and Andrew Cogan and aided by a local translator Beri Thimappa). The East India Company was granted land by the local chief Damarla Venkatappa Nayak, at a village called Madraspatnam, to build a trading settlement. The document of the land grant is dated 22 August 1639, and hence Madras celebrates its birthday on 22 August each year as Madras day. The British built <b>Fort St. George</b> (today the legislative and administrative seat of the state). Fort St George was completed on St George's day in 1640 (23 April) and hence was named after the patron saint. George Town then developed becoming the modern city of Madras, absorbing several nearby boroughs. Thomas was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ and is associated with Chennai. It is said he came to India as an evangelist and died in what is now Chennai. Two suburbs, Santhome, and St. Thomas Mount are named in his memory.
</p><p>Chennai also played host to a Portuguese trading post which covered most of Mylapore, a present-day Chennai neighbourhood. São Tomé de Meliapore was a province of Portuguese India which existed from 1523 to 1749.

<p>Chennai is the gateway to Southern India, and its culture is distinctly different from that of any other city in India. Tamil tradition and culture are indigenous to this region and are essentially the celebration of beauty, which is exemplified through dance, clothing, and sculptures. Chennai is both a traditional and a modern cosmopolitan city; the culture of the city reflects its diverse population. The traditional arts, music, dance, and all other art forms of Tamilnadu grow and flourish here. The food is a unique blend from traditional to fast food to filter kaapi. It’s a land of temples and priests. The architecture ranges from ancient temples to modern high-rises. Music is classical and western, to the growing nightlife in the city. You can find a school for traditional Bharatanatyam or Salsa dance and music school for veena, violin, Guitar, drums in almost every neighborhood of the city. Chennai checks its traditionalism every December when the music season is in full swing. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Dance</b>. Chennai is home to the distinct dance form of Bharat Natyam. <b>Bharatanatyam</b> is the celebration of the eternal universe through the celebration of the beauty of the body. This is done through its tenets of having a perfectly erect posture, as straight and pouts curving stomach, a well-rounded and proportionate body mass to the all body structure, very long hair, and curvaceous hips. These tenets bring to life the philosophy of Natyashastra, ‘Angikam bhuvanam yasya’ (the body is your world). This is elaborated in the araimandi posture, when the performer assumes a half-sitting position with the knees turned sideways, with a very erect posture. In this fundamental posture of the Bharatanatyam dance, the distance between the head and the navel becomes equal to that between the earth and the navel. In a similar way, the distance between the outstretched right arm to the outstretched left arm becomes equal to the distance between the head and the feet, thus representing the "Natyapurusha", the embodiment of life and creation.</li>
<li><b>Music</b>. There are many composers in Carnatic music. Purandara Dasa (1480-1564) is known as the father (Pitamaha) of Carnatic music due to his pioneering contributions to Carnatic music. The compositions of this music are rendered frequently by the artists of today during the music festival season. Chennai has a lot of Carnatic music <i>Sabhas</i> (loosely translates to "concert house") where concerts are held during the Madras Music season. You will see mostly older celebrities, although occasionally there will be some world-class young virtuosos.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Music in the cinema industry has emerged as an important entertainment platform in Chennai, over the years portraying the cultural changes, trends, aspirations, and developments experienced by its people.</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Traditional Tamil Clothing</b> - Tamil women traditionally wear the <b>Saree or Sari</b> while the men wear <b>veshti</b>, which could be either a white Pancha or a colorful <b>lungi</b> with typical South Indian patterns. The saree, being an un-stitched wrap, enhances the shape of the wearer while only partially covering the midriff. In Indian philosophy, the navel of the Supreme Being is considered the source of life and creativity. Therefore by tradition, the stomach and the navel are to be left unconcealed, though the philosophy behind the costume has largely been forgotten. This makes the realization of sharira-mandala (the body), wherein Angikam bhuvanam yasya (the body is your world) unites with the shaarira-mandala (the whole universe), as expressed in the Natyashastra. These principles of the saree, also are held for other forms of wraps, like the lungi worn by men. The lungi can be wrapped over clockwise or anti-clockwise and can be tied at the back or fixed just along the waistline. It's sometimes lifted till knee and tied at the waist leisurely or just is held in the hand to speed up walking. In traditional Brahmin homes, men wear panchey kachche which is tied at the back taking it between legs. A similar pattern is seen on the women's wraps.</li></ul>

<p>The climate of Chennai is Tropical. Chennai is situated in the Thermal Equator zone which prevents extreme changes in temperature. Chennai has mainly two seasons - summer (35-42&#176;C / 95-108&#176;F) Apr-Jun (Highest temperature ever recorded is 45&#176;C / 113&#176;F on 30 May 2003) and monsoon (Oct-Dec). It receives little rainfall from the south-west monsoon (Jun-Sep) while rest of India is lashed by heavy rains, but gets its bountiful rains from the <b>north-east monsoon</b> from October through December, thus amounting to about 125-150 cm (49-59 in) of rainfall annually. Chennai receives abundant rainfall from October to December covering dried up scrub lands with greenery. December to February are the mildest months with temperatures in the range of - (19-28&#176;C / 66-82&#176;F). 
</p><p>December to March is probably the best time to visit Chennai: the temperatures rarely exceed 30&#176;C during midday and evenings are pleasant.
</p><p>Climate is humid pretty much throughout the year because the city is on the coast. Summers are very hot and humid. Be sure to take along light clothing. Winter clothes are useless in Chennai, since wearing a sweater will leave you drenched in sweat in less than five minutes.

<p><b><a href="/en/Tamil_phrasebook" title="Tamil phrasebook">Tamil</a></b> is the official language in Chennai, and also the first language of most locals. When visiting Chennai, as in any other city in the world, it is useful to learn a little local language. However, knowledge of English is sufficient for the average tourist to navigate through the city. English education is widespread in Chennai. All educated people in Chennai can speak English while most people can understand and speak simple English. All important signboards are in Tamil and English. Transactions in major commercial establishments are in English. Even if the shop is not staffed by someone who can speak English, it wouldn't be too difficult to find a passerby who can converse in English well and would be happy to help a tourist. The English accent is different, there is a tendency to end sentences and words with -uh (Eg: I'm going there-uh.) and make interrogative sentences with -ah (Eg: You are going there-ah?). If you are in doubt, find a well dressed young person and they should be able to communicate with you in English.
</p><p>Unlike other major cities in Northern India, <a href="/en/Hindi_phrasebook" title="Hindi phrasebook">Hindi</a> is <i>not</i> widely understood. While there has been a significant increase in Hindi speakers in recent years, most locals will find it difficult to understand when you try to speak to them in Hindi. Better speak in English than Hindi in most southern cities <b>except</b> <a href="/en/Bangalore" class="mw-redirect" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> and <a href="/en/Hyderabad" title="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>. Chennai has a reputation for anti-Hindi sentiments among the people and you are more likely to be treated better if you speak in English rather than in Hindi.
</p><p>Those native to Chennai and its suburbs speak the language of Tamil with a characteristic accent due to the proximity of the city to the State of Andhra Pradesh (where the official language is Telugu) and the presence of a sizable Telugu-speaking population in the city. There is heavy borrowing of Telugu words into the vocabulary of 'Chennai Tamil' which is popularly known as <i>Madras Bashai</i>.

<p>The cheapest way to get to the city is to take the suburban train following the city. The suburban train connects you to Chennai Park and Egmore, the two main passenger train stations. Note that this train does not go through Chennai Central station but instead goes to Chennai Park station which is within walking distance from Chennai Central. This is the best mode of transport if you don't have large amounts of baggage. You have to exit the airport and walk a considerable distance (~500m) to reach the station "Tirusulam". Tickets bought don't have to be validated but save the ticket in case there is an inspection. It is advisable to take a first-class ticket on the train if you happen to reach the airport during peak hours. The general compartments are often over-crowded as they transport regular commuters to work. During peak hours even the first-class compartments can be crowded. 
</p><p>The Chennai metro is also now connected to the airport and the Airport metro station is now connected via travelator to level 1 of the international terminal. Trains from the airport to Central and Egmore run every 20 min via Vadapalani, Koyambedu, Anna nagar, Shenoy Nagar and Nehru park and every 10 min during Peak hours. Also, the (blue) line is operational till AG DMS- Near Hyatt Regency Hotel at Anna Salai. However, you can interchange at Alandur (for the Greenline, to go to either St. Thomas mount railway station or CMBT, the state-run bus terminus of Chennai.  Otherwise, use the pre-paid taxi booth.  Aviation Express is massively overpriced.
</p><p>Using the pre-paid taxi to get to the city, each terminal has several booths for several taxi companies when you exit the airport, outside before you meet the crowd. The fares are different for the domestic and international terminals though the terminals are next to each other. You can either choose the standard Taxis (Black with Yellow tops) which are usually the ancient Ambassador cars or the private call-taxi (which can come in any model and in any color). As in any Indian airport, you will be immediately negotiated for transportation with promised offerings of the best price. A firm No should make them lose interest, ignore them if they continue harassing you. It's better to keep small change in hand while paying at the counters. Note the taxi number written on your charge slip (one copy is for the passenger and the other is for the driver to collect the fare from the counter). Make your way to the taxi stand and get the taxi number allotted at the designated desk. The helpful drivers offer to take your luggage and guide you to the taxi that drives up quickly near the allotment desk.   
</p><p>Pre-paid and yellow top taxis are not air-conditioned, are of vintages right from the 70s and 80s, rickety, prone to stop midway, drivers exhibit rough behavior, sometimes could be dangerous, demand exorbitant fares, pre-paid may mean nothing and they may demand more when you get down. Keep away from these types. Or know that you can always negotiate.
An online aggregator like <b>Uber<i> and </i></b><i>Ola'</i> is pretty comfortable and safe. The cars are new and air-conditioned.

<p>Chennai has one of Asia's largest bus stations, Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT). Seven different state-owned corporations drive buses to and from various destinations within <a href="/en/South_India" class="mw-redirect" title="South India">South India</a>. Connected to the Airport and the passenger train stations (Chennai Central and Egmore) by direct buses, it offers a cheap and spontaneous mode of travel. There are hourly buses to places like <a href="/en/Tirupati" title="Tirupati">Tirupati</a>, <a href="/en/Pondicherry" title="Pondicherry">Pondicherry</a>, <a href="/en/Coimbatore" title="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a>, <a href="/en/Tirunelveli" title="Tirunelveli">Tirunelveli</a>. You will get the option of A/C, Non-A/C or sleeper coaches to cities like <a href="/en/Bangalore" class="mw-redirect" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a href="/en/Trivandrum" class="mw-redirect" title="Trivandrum">Trivandrum</a>, <a href="/en/Hyderabad" title="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>.
</p><p>Several private companies also operate buses between most southern destinations. During the weekends most buses are fully occupied and it's better to reserve a ticket in advance. All buses terminate near Koyambedu but there are different stands for state-owned (CMBT - Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus), and private buses (Omni bus terminus). Both these terminus are near each other, and it is better to tell your exact destination to the taxi/auto-rickshaw driver. Buses usually drop passengers at various points in the city before reaching the Terminus. Feel free to ask the driver or fellow passengers the closest drop-off point to your destination. Always ask for the ticket and carry it until the end of your journey. 
</p><p>Once in the city, it's easy to get overcharged if you try to hire auto-rickshaws to get to your destination. While the law requires drivers to use meters, enforcement isn't very effective. It would be more comfortable and hassle-free to hire a cab or figure out the city bus routes and the suburban trains schedule.

With the progress of the <b>Golden Quadrilateral</b> project, driving down from Bangalore is an option too. Indian drivers fit into the traffic without problems, but foreign drivers are strongly discouraged from driving in India. Rules are not really rules and the lanes are subject to change without notice.

<p>It is advisable to plan your journey accordingly. Traveling within Chennai is not as cheap as other places in India, but is quite cheap by European and American standards. As a foreigners, it is safe to wear a mask while traveling by motorcycles as air pollution can be quite bad. Travelling by motorcycle is not for the faint hearted and drivers not accustomed to Chennai's traffic should not attempt to drive in the city. Give yourself a few months to get used to the traffic before trying to drive.

<p><b>Chennai has a suburban train</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://enquiry.indianrail.gov.in/mntes/">[5]</a> network. There are four routes:
</p>
<ul><li>Western Line: Chennai Central - Arakkonam.</li>
<li>North Line: Chennai Central - Gummidipoondi-Sulurpet-Nellore</li>
<li>South Line: Chennai Beach - Tambaram and Chengalpet</li>
<li>MRTS Line: Chennai Beach - Velachery (MRTS)</li></ul>
<p>Few trains on Western and North Line originate from Chennai Beach instead of Chennai Central. The Chennai Beach - Tambaram/Chengalpet is the most used line, it takes you from the city to Vandalur Zoo. The suburban trains are generally reliable and fast but they were built more for practical purposes of commuting than connecting tourist attractions. Unless you know your destination for sure, check with locals or ask information desks for the quickest way to reach your destination. The frequency of suburban trains is generally good and it is advisable to take a first-class ticket during peak hours. Trains are a reliable alternative to reaching a destination quickly compared to buses that can get stuck in traffic jams. The Chennai suburban trains fare is the lowest in the country. <b>Always keep your baggage safe when you are traveling in the suburban railway system</b>.
</p><p>Chennai Central (hub for north and west suburban lines) is opposite Park Town (MRTS line) and Park (South Suburban line). These 3 stations form an interchange triad and have the largest connection between the suburban lines in the area.

<p><b>Chennai has Metro Train Network</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://routemaps.info/chennai-metro/">[6]</a> stretching 32 km since 2015. Chennai Airport is connected by Blue Line, while Mofussil Bus Terminal (CMBT)/KoyamBedu is connected by Green Line. The first train starts at 6:00 and the last train leaves at 22:00. During rush hours (7:00-10:00 and 18:00-21:00), every 5 minutes a train is assured, while it could take nearly 15 minutes in non-peak hours. Guards are helpful to offer help. Automatic Vending Machines for both tickets and Juices at the Koyambedu/CMBT Station make for a happy experience.

<p>The roads in Chennai are better maintained than the average Indian road. Rush hour traffic may result in nasty jams. Chennai has three arterial roads: Anna Salai/ Mount Road, EVR Periyar Salai/ Poonamallee High Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Salai/ 100 feet Road.
</p><p>Metropolitan Transport Corporation(MTC) buses run around the city and reach places that are not accessible by commuter trains. These are government-run and extremely cheap. Chennai has few major termini from where the majority of the buses ply towards the rest of the city. Left Side Seats are reserved for ladies and Right Side Seats are for Men.
</p><p>Deluxe and A/C Buses are also operated on major routes. The price of a deluxe bus is almost twice that of a regular bus. Usually, deluxe and regular buses have the same number for the same route but deluxe buses run long-distance journeys stopping at major bus stops only. So if you find regular buses too crowded, take the deluxe one. Non AC deluxe also have power gates and better suspension which you won't find in the regular bus. If you have luggage with you, you might have to pay the cost of an extra person depending upon its size. A simple way of identifying the category of the bus is this: White Display Board - Standard Service, green display board-Express, Blue or LED - Deluxe Service, A/C Service - 2 doors, low floor Volvo bus. 
</p><p>AC bus runs by MTC Chennai which runs between important routes like Parrys - Tambaram, Parrys - CMBT, Chennai Central - CMBT, Chennai central - Tambaram, CMBT - Kelambakkam/Sirusery, T.Nagar - Kanchipuram, etc. Most frequent AC bus runs between CMBT towards Pondicherry and are known as East coast road (ECR) buses and Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) and is very comfortable for intracity travel too.
</p><p>If you are getting into a bus from Chennai central railway station you can either catch a bus just in front of the railway station or you can take the subway to cross the road and get it from the bus stop in front of the government hospital.
</p><p><b>Bus Route information for Chennai is available online at official site</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.grepcity.com/travel/bus-info/city-bus-timings-and-routes.php">[7]</a>, also<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.livechennai.com/chennai_metro_bus_routes.asp">[8]</a>. 
</p><p>Tourists can use regular and deluxe bus services on all routes within the city. It is worthwhile to purchase the daily pass if you plan to visit more than a couple of sights in a day. The daily pass can be purchased on the first bus you board from the conductor, while the weekly and monthly passes are sold at all major terminus. Recently a hop-on hop-off tour bus has also been organized by the Government. The service covers many of the famous sights along the scenic East Coast Road up to <a href="/en/Mahabalipuram" class="mw-redirect" title="Mahabalipuram">Mahabalipuram</a>.

</p><p>As in other major Indian cities, Uber and its local rival Ola have refused traditional taxi calls.
</p><p>Alternatively, you can hire a cab for a limited time or full day for your travel aims within the city for an adequate charge depending upon the car model you choose and the time duration for which you use the cab. If your trip is time-sensitive, it is recommended that you make the booking about 4 hours in advance and call shortly before your journey to confirm. However, chances are you won’t get hired cab, despite the fact that it was pre-ordered before, as customers are simply answered at the last minute.

<p>Auto-rickshaws are famous in Thailand as the Tuk-tuk and in Indonesia as the Bajaj. In Chennai, they are colloquially referred to as an auto. Police require auto-rickshaw drivers in Chennai to use meters. In fact, many of them try to avoid using meters and some try to overcharge tourists. There would be advised to use auto-rickshaws with meters only. Roughly 50-60% of drivers do use meters. So, If a particular driver doesn't agree - just go away and find another one. Move 100 m away from malls where touts concentrate. You will definitely succeed to catch a metered auto within 5-10 mins during day time. In any case, you don't have to pay for any empty return trips that the auto-rickshaw driver has to make once you have agreed upon a fare. Sometimes Airports and Railway Stations have a tariff chart.
</p><p>Otherwise, you can negotiate the price with the driver. Often they will try to quote 2-3 times more than the real cost. Even so, by Western standards, they are very cheap. Don't take the first auto-rickshaw or take the first price, get a quote and negotiate with at least 2-3 autos before agreeing to travel with one. Consult local friends beforehand to find out a reasonable market price. Use Auto-rickshaws only for short distances because they are uncomfortable. Never leave anything behind when you leave.
</p><p>Share autos have emerged in recent years as an alternative mode of transport in Chennai. They are over-sized three/four wheelers charge slightly more than the bus but way lesser than a regular auto. Likewise, they are faster than the buses but slower than the autos. There are four wheelers known as <b> meter taxis</b>, which don't have a meter and are not taxis. They supplement the existing bus services and sometimes operate on routes based on popular demand.

<ul><li><b>Georgetown</b> in the north of the city is considered the oldest neighborhood and is associated with the nearby port.

Basilica of the National Shrine of St.Thomas is in Chennai, India. The present National Shrine of St.Thomas is built over the tomb of Saint Thomas the Apostle, who came to India in the year 52 AD. After preaching on the West coast, he came to Chennai (formerly Madras), and attained martyrdom on a hill at the outskirts of the city, today known as "St. Thomas Mount." His body was buried on the spot over which the present Basilica stands. The shrine was restored in 2004. A valuable work of art kept in the Basilica is an ancient painting of Our Blessed Mother, in front of which the other great apostle of India, St. Francis Xavier, used to pray. There are two new structures today: <b>The Tomb Chapel</b> below the Basilica and <b>Museum cum theatre</b>. The new underground chapel with a separate access outside the church structure, allows pilgrims to pray at the tomb and tourists to visit it, without disturbing the sacred functions in the church. The museum exhibits artifacts connected with St. Thomas and the Basilica, and the theatre is used for screening a short video on the life of the Apostle.</span> </span></li>

It is the oldest Anglican church in the East designed by William Dixon, the then Master Gunner of the Fort. Given the precarious nature of the English presence in India at the time (not to mention later attacks by the French and the locals), the church has a defensive stance - thick walls, castellated parapets, and a well within the grounds - to withstand any bombardment or siege). The church was consecrated on 28 October 1680. The tower was completed in 1701; the steeple was added in 1710 and the tower was connected to the main body of the church in 1759. The interior of the church contains many fascinating plaques and monuments to early British India evoking past glories and lives full of achievement.

<ul><li><b>St. Thomas Mount</b>, Chennai South. St.Thomas, referred to as Didymus, in the Gospel of St.John is one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ. He is one of the prime witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus. St. Thomas Mount is associated with St. Thomas, the apostle of Christ, who is believed to have been martyred here. The mount is commonly called in Tamil "Parangi Malai" or "Bhringi Malai". History says 2000 years ago, a saint 'Parangi' lived here ('parangi' in Tamil language is used to refer to a white person). According to local myth, St. Thomas was one of the first Christians who reached India to preach Christianity. He is believed to have reached South India in AD 52, and spent the last years of his life in a cave on this hill. Tradition states that Thomas was assassinated by an arrow in AD 72, by the persons hostile to him. Thus, the hillock acquired the name, St. Thomas Mount. Over time Anglo-Indians predominated in this area. A small relic-filled Church built-in 1523 at the summit of the 300 feet high Mount. The place was visited by Pope John Paul II during his visit to India on 5 February 1986. At the northern foot of the mount, is a gateway of four impressive arches surmounted by a cross bearing the inscribed date 1547. A flight of 160 steps leads up to the summit of the mount. There are 14 stations of the cross erected on the way to the summit.</li>

<li><b>Fort St. George</b> (formerly known as White Town), is located on the banks of the Bay of Bengal. It was established as the East India Company's fortified foothold in Madras and the small trading post (or 'factory' as it was then known) that British influence spread throughout India. The establishment of Fort St. George marked the birth of the new city that is Madras, in the year 1640. The fort was named after St George who is believed to have preached in the region. The British East India Company, after buying the land from the <b>Nayak of Vandavasi in 1639</b>, led the establishment of what was called the <b>Madrasemen</b>, the permanent settlement of the company. One year later they built the fort as a commanding post in the region. With the increased trade activities of the East India Company the region soon developed into a popular trade and commerce center. The British enjoyed supremacy in the region until 1746 when the French attacked the fort and captured it. After three years, in 1749 the British regained power by signing a treaty with the French. In the meantime, they fortified the base in order to repel the invasion of Hyder Ali and the French. <i>The fort is believed to be the first establishment of the British in India.</i> Military architecture is interesting and holds great historical importance. Inside the Fort is the <b>Fort Museum</b> decorated with cannons of Tipu Sultan. There are a lot of interesting artifacts showcased in the museum. Apart from the museum, the southern division of the Archaeological Survey of India is located here. Today, Fort St George is famous for its exotic collection of books in the library and housing the legislative assembly in the secretariat building. The fort in its present form looks more like a mansion, rather any fort. Various Government offices function inside this building, including the structure which used to be the residence of Robert Clive called the <b>Clive House</b>. <b>St. Mary's Church,</b> situated in the fort, is one of the oldest surviving churches built by the British in India. <b>The tallest flag pole</b> in the country can be seen here, its height is 150 feet. The pole is now made of metal but was originally made entirely of teak wood.</li>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Although Chennai beaches are both beautiful and inviting, they are not swimming beaches, due to strong under currents present along the shoreline. <b>Swimming should not be attempted there.</b> There are no lifeguards and rescue equipment is not provided at any of these beaches. However, there are "beach police" who ride on horses and keep an eye on the people and look out for any trouble. People should avoid wearing swimwear or similar attire on the city beaches as such clothing is not appropriate there and will attract stares.

<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Breezy_Beach"><span class="fn org">Breezy Beach</span>. <span class="description">It is located in the quiet neighborhood of Valmiki Nagar (Thiruvanmiyur) in Chennai. It is smaller and less popular than Elliot's beach. This beach is not as commercialized as Elliot's beach and is hence more quiet and peaceful. Evenings are very pleasant and with gentle breezy here. Lots of tourists are attracted towards this beach. Since the residential area around this beach is occupied predominantly by young professionals working in the IT/ITES industries, this beach has turned into a hot spot for them. It is less polluted and environmentally friendly. For those who look for a calm, cool, and breezy place to relax, this beach is the best place in Chennai.</span> </span></li>
<li><span class="vcard" id="Edward_Elliots_beach"><span class="fn org">Edward Elliot's beach</span>. <span class="description">It is spread along the coast down south from Marina. It is also the night beach for Chennai youth. This beach is comparatively quieter and is located near Besant Nagar. At the end of this beach are the Velankanni church and the Ashtalakshmi temple. Good roads, pavements, walking track, illuminated sands, makes a visit to this beach a real pleasure. It can get really crowded during the weekends as well.</span> </span></li>
<li><span class="vcard" id="Marina_Beach"><span class="fn org">Marina Beach</span>. <span class="description">It is 12 km long and offers excellent opportunities for the walk and has a very wide sandy foreshore. Its width is up to 300 m (985 ft). The Marina of Madras is the second longest urban beach in the world. Along the shore, there are many buildings built during the British colonial rule. The South Beach Road runs past the Madras University, the Senate House, the Chepauk Palace (Nawabs of Carnatica once held their court here). It is the most popular gathering place for locals, especially in the evenings and on weekends. It can also get very crowded at those times. The beach is relatively less crowded in the early mornings and more pleasant. Walk along the Marina in the evening to cool off and eat crispy "sundal" (built, spiced lentils), freshly caught fish, and Murukku (a type of dry noodles). Watching the sunrise from the beach is an excellent experience. It's not a swimming beach, though you will see people fully clothed taking partial dips.</span> </span></li></ul>

<p><b>Tamil Nadu Cuisine</b>. Rice is the staple diet in Chennai. Rice based food like the Dosa, Idli and Uttapam are popular breakfast food in Tamil cuisine. Chennai offers a wide range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian delicacies. The food here gets its flavor from a host of spices and condiments used in Tamil Nadu. Coconut, tamarind, and asafoetida are essential in almost all vegetarian recipes. Garam masala is avoided in Tamil cuisine. Gingelly oil (made from Sesame seeds) is normally used to give a dish a distinct flavor. Chutneys and mixed spices are served in the lunch and enhance the taste of the meal. The <b>South India lunch</b> (also called meals) in Chennai consists of cooked rice served with different kinds of vegetable dishes, Sambar, chutneys, Rasam (a hot broth made with tamarind juice and pepper), and curd (yogurt). The non-vegetarian lunch includes curries or dishes cooked with mutton, chicken, or fish. Tamil meals are incomplete without crisp Papads or Appalam. In Chennai, Chettinad cuisine of Tamil Nadu is particularly famous. This cuisine is hot and spicy and provides delectable variety in mutton, chicken, and fish dishes. <b>Chettinad Pepper Chicken</b> is one of the most famous dishes in Tamil Nadu. Paya is a type of spiced trotter’s broth and is eaten with Parathas or Appam. Breakfast or tiffin in Chennai includes <b>idly</b> (steamed rice cakes), <b>dosai</b> (a pancake made from a batter of rice) and lentils crisp fried on a pan, <b>vadai</b> (deep fried doughnuts made from a batter of lentils), <b>pongal</b> (a mash of rice and lentils boiled together and seasoned with ghee, cashew nuts, pepper, and cumin seed), <b>uppuma</b> (cooked semolina seasoned in oil with mustard, pepper, cumin seed and dry lentils). Most of the breakfast dishes in Chennai are eaten with coconut <b>chutney, sambar</b> (seasoned lentil broth) and <b>milagai podi</b> (a powdered mix of several dried lentils eaten with oil). 
</p><p>Chennai has numerous restaurants, offering an assortment of cuisine. The beach restaurants are well maintained and serve great food during the evenings.

<p>Chennai is a difficult place to drink alcohol. Drinking is culturally frowned upon although almost every young person drinks. Government rules state that only establishments with a minimum of 21 bedrooms can obtain a bar/liquor license. Hence there are no separate bars or pubs here. All the bars are a part of a hotel and are far from each other. 
</p><p>Drinking is a habit of two social classes in India: the lower sections of the society and the highest. As a result, you will either find dingy places or exceptionally classy ones.
</p><p>Government-run liquor stores called TASMAC are all over the place but, in general, not a pleasant experience. They usually have rude staff, are filthy, and have very limited options to cater to the lower classes. Try it if you want a one-time war-like experience in order to obtain some booze.
</p><p>Clubs and discotheques may be thought to be a rarity in conservative Chennai, but there are plenty and the list is growing. Compared to other cities, Chennai has no curfews over closing hours, so theoretically they can be open 24hours, but most clubs and bars close by 3am. Most bars double as nightclubs.

<p>Tamil Nadu, especially Chennai, is famous for its <b>filter coffee</b>. Most Tamils have a subtle dislike for instant coffee; therefore filter coffee is more popular. The preparation of filter coffee is almost like a daily chore, the coffee beans have to be first roasted and then ground. The coffee powder is then put into a filter set and hot boiled water is added to prepare the boiling and allowed to sit for about 15 minutes. The decoction is then added to milk with sugar to taste. The drink thus prepared is then poured from one container to another to create the perfect sparkling cup of filter coffee. An exotic drink that refreshes and retains its flavor is best served in "Dabarah" set consisting of a steel cup and a plate with a rim.
</p><p>There exists very specific variety on the local beverage list in India<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.christineabroad.com/indian-drinks/">[21]</a>. Try something for tasting.

<p>Chennai is generally a safer area of India in terms of crime, although pickpocketing, muggings, and robberies sporadically occur. Keep your doors and windows shut and locked at night and do not carry or display large amounts of cash if possible.
</p><p>It is advisable for women, especially unaccompanied ones, to dress modestly and limit their interaction with unfamiliar local men. Foreigners were generally overcharged by auto-rickshaws simply because they were ignorant of the prevailing fares. It is necessary to confirm whether the driver knows the exact destination. 'Autos', as auto-rickshaws are known in Chennai, are notorious for ripping off customers, tourists, and locals, so when you get in, ask the driver for turning on the meter.
</p><p>Be alert to your surroundings and watch where you step, especially if you get caught in a large crowd where it is difficult to look at what is in front of you. Cross streets extremely carefully as traffic is generally heavy. On major roads, use the underground crossings (locally called "subways"). Avoid using underground road-crossing/ subways at night or if you notice them to be empty or not well lit. Traffic signals are frequently ignored by drivers and pedestrians alike, and it is not at all advisable for tourists to try driving in Chennai. You can also hire a driver to drive you. You can find them in travel agencies, but some of the local drivers, especially the young (18-20 yrs) drive rashly. The best option is to ask your hotel to recommend their usual driver.
</p>

<p>While in Chennai it is advisable to <b>drink only bottled water</b>. Do not trust water from small local restaurants as it may be from the tap, and avoid cold or iced drinks that are not commercially sold (Bigger chains of eateries and juice shops can be trusted to an extent). Eating fresh vegetables and fruits that have been sold outside in the presence of insects can also be unhealthy, although bananas and coconuts are usually safe because they are opened only immediately before eating. Hot drinks in restaurants such as tea, coffee, and other local specialties are safe, as are packaged/bottled drinks such as Aquafina water, Frooti (a popular local mango drink), and others. When you buy packaged bottles make sure that the seal is intact and crush bottles upon use to prevent other people from reusing your bottle. If you have access to a stove, boiling tap water before drinking is also an option. Never eat from roadside shops as the food can be prepared in unhygienic conditions.
</p><p>Chennai summers are humid and stuffy. It's better to step out with an <b>umbrella</b>, <b>bottled water</b> and some <b>oral rehydration salts</b> (available from pharmacies, the brand name is Electral). It will come in handy if you dehydrate.

<p>Many hotels will change money for you at the front desk. However, they may not have the best rates. It is best to change money at the city-based money changers than the ones located at the airports. Airport currency exchange offices offer a lower exchange rate to Indian rupees and sell at a much higher than the market rate.
