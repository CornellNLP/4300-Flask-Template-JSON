<p>Sydney is a major global city and one of the most important cities for finance in the Asia-Pacific. The city is surrounded by nature and national parks, which extend through the suburbs and right to the shores of the harbour.
It could be said that the tyranny of distance has shrunk in recent times. Sydney is now only a flight away from some of the fastest growing and largest economies in the world. This has increased the profile of the city, admired for its clean environment and fantastic weather. 
</p><p>Sydney's 4,757,083 residents (according to a 2013 estimate) sprawl over an area of more than 12,350km². The timezone is identical with the majority of the state of <a href="/en/New_South_Wales" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a>: GMT +10.  The local timezone is AEST or Australian Eastern Standard Time.  The city, as does the rest of the state, observes Daylight Savings time from October to April each year. During daylight savings time Sydney is 30 minutes ahead of Adelaide, 1 hour ahead of Brisbane and 3 hours ahead of Singapore. 
</p><p>Sydney became the center of the world's attention in September 2000 when the city hosted the Summer Olympics - officially announced by the IOC Chairman at the closing Ceremony to be the "the best games ever"! The Olympics saw a major building and renovation program take hold of Sydney, positioning it as one of the great world cities of the 21st century. Sydney continues to attract and host large international events

<p>Some evidence suggests that humans inhabited the area of Australia that would later become Sydney almost 50,000 years before the first European settlers arrived. How those first people arrived in Sydney still remains an unsolved mystery. What is known is that in the late 1700's an English Lord named Thomas Townshend (aka Lord Sydney) thought it would be a great idea if England established a penal colony on the east coast of Australia, an area discovered by Captain James Cook about 16 years earlier.
</p><p>On January 26, 1788, a fleet of 11 (known as the First Fleet) ships, bearing around 850 prisoners, arrived at Sydney Cove. The date became known as Australia Day. The European diseases the colonists brought with them rapidly decimated the native population. A shortage of food and lack of farming knowledge led to widespread starvation that almost wiped out the convicts and their guards. The arrival of the second fleet in 1790 was meant to bring relief in the form of supplies, but primarily brought more sick and dying convicts which only worsened the situation.
</p><p>In 1810, Lachlan Macquarie became governor of Sydney and conditions began to improve. Macquarie wanted to build a city and build he did. Under his leadership, labor forces (made up primarily of convicts) erected public buildings such as banks and churches, constructed roads and bridges, and built wharves to accommodate the rapidly burgeoning maritime trade. He also allowed convicts who had served their term to enter society as free citizens. Macquarie's tenure as governor ended in 1821 when he was recalled to London for spending too much money and ruling autocratically. 
</p><p>Sydney continued to grow, despite Macquarie's absence. In 1842, Sydney was incorporated and became Australia's first official city. The practice of transporting convicts ended in 1850, by which time it had a population of 35,000 people.
</p><p>Australia experienced an overall population depletion as citizens left the country to seek their fortune in the gold fields of California. Around 1852, though, gold was discovered in Australia and people came pouring back into the country. The Australian economy boomed. By 1871, Sydney's population had reached 200,000. 
</p><p>Despite a few setbacks, namely an outbreak of bubonic plague in 1900, the Great Depression and two world wars, Sydney continued to thrive. By the early 1950's, Sydney's population, boosted by a steady influx of immigrants, had jumped from 481,000 to over one and a half million. Employment rates were high and the economy strong. Skyscrapers began to dot Sydney's landscape and its iconic opera house opened in 1973. The 2000 Summer Olympic Games were held in Sydney, branding the city once and for all as a city worth noting.
</p><p>Today, Sydney is home to over four million "Sydneysiders." It is considered one of the most diverse cities in the world, with more than 40% of the population originally hailing from outside Australia. Its comfortable climate, iconic structures, beautiful beaches and exotic wildlife have all combined to help make Sydney one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="People">People</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sydney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: People">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>When the First Fleet, under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, landed in Botany Bay in 1788, it set off a chain of events that would forever change the population of what would later become known as Sydney. For at least 35,000 years, Aborigines had been the sole inhabitants of this part of Australia. No one knows exactly how many Aborigines lived in Sydney before Philip's arrival. What is known for certain is that during the years following the landing of First Fleet, the native population was decimated, primarily by genocide and disease. Today, Aborigines comprise only approximately 2% of Sydney's total population. 
</p><p>For a time, therefore, Sydney was comprised almost entirely of British convicts, their guards and the few settlers who accompanied them. In 1851, the Australian gold rush brought immigrants pouring in from all around the world and Sydney's population exploded. The biggest influx of immigrants came from the United Kingdom, Ireland, America, China and Germany. Today, over 40% of Sydney's population cite their ancestry as English, Scottish, Irish or Chinese.
</p><p>After the gold rush, Sydney's population continued to grow. Today it has the largest population of any city in Australia, although Melbourne is hot on its heels. It is considered one of the most multi-culturally diverse cities in the world. Approximately 60% of the 4.8 million people who call Sydney home were born in Australia. People identifying as English or Chinese comprise the majority of the rest of the population. 
</p><p>This population diversity is reflected in a multitude of spoken languages. (Australian) English is considered the national language of Australia. It's similar to British English (which differs somewhat from American English) but has some of its own unique vernacular. While the majority of people speak English, it would not be considered out of place to hear conversations in Chinese, Arabic or Greek. When taken as a whole, Sydneysiders speak over 250 languages. 
</p><p>When it comes to religious beliefs, Roman Catholics and Anglicans form the biggest religious groups, with Islam coming in a close third. Close to 18% of the population do not identify with any religion.
</p><p>The population of Sydney is comprised predominantly of young professionals. In fact, over 70% of the city's residents are between the ages of 18 and 49. The residents are pretty evenly split between men and women. Close to 8% of the population are under 15, and approximately 11% are over 65.
</p><p>Sydney is recognised worldwide for its vibrant gay community. Every year, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is celebrated on the first weekend in March, drawing people from all over Australia and the world for the celebrations.
</p><p>The rising housing prices and living costs in Sydney have had a negative effect on the culture and many consumer services. Many Australians outside Sydney often describe it as having a "rip-off" culture.

<p>Sydney is comfortable for travellers to visit any time of year. The city enjoys over 300 sunny days each year. Though it has 104 days of clear skies.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Summer</b> (December to February) is the best time to enjoy Sydney's beachside outdoor lifestyle. Temperatures usually reach around 26°C (about 79°F) but it can be very hot, with temperatures climbing to over 40°C (104°F) for a few days each summer.  Summer days can be humid, and sometimes have searing dry winds, but they frequently end with a "southerly buster", a cold front sweeping up from the south, bringing a clearly noticeable drop in temperature, rain and thunder. Within hours, the storm can pass and the evening continues cooler.  Hot windy days can create a risk of bushfire, and on days of severe risk national parks and walking trails may be closed. 'Total fire bans' are also common - they will be announced on weather reports and on signs at national park entrances (also on the website of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_content.cfm?cat_id=1109">Rural Fire Service</a>). Occasionally low pressure systems drift down from the tropics, giving periods of more unstable weather. You won't need to pack much more than T-shirts to visit Sydney in summer, but remember your hat and sunglasses.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Autumn</b> (March to May) is still warm with mild nights. There can be good days for the beach in March, but you can't count on it. It is a good time for visiting attractions, going to the zoo, catching ferries around the harbour without the summer crowds.  You may need a warm top for the evenings, especially for May. Autumn is also a good time to visit the Royal Easter Show.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Winter</b> (June to August) is cool, not cold. Average July maximum temperatures are 17°C, and daytime temperatures rarely drop below 14°C, but night-time temperatures can fall to below 10°C.  Most rain falls as a result of a few off-shore low pressure systems, which usually result in two or three rainy weeks during winter.  The <i>Icebergs</i> will be in the ocean doing their morning laps, but most of Sydney will be well away from the beach.  It does not snow in Sydney, and unless you intend spending long periods outside, you can usually get by with just a warm top. Sydney is a year-round city, and only the outdoor water-parks close for the winter. If the beach isn't your scene, and you don't like the heat, winter may be your time to visit.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Spring</b> (September to November).  Spring days are great for exploring Sydney's attractions, bushwalking, cycling, and the outdoors. Beaches are generally patrolled from the end of October, and Sydneysiders start flocking to the beaches in November. Sydney is the driest and sunniest in spring.</li></ul>
<p>Sydney's Western Suburbs, which lie away from the coast, tend to be hotter during the day and a little cooler during the night. They miss the afternoon sea breezes and the night-time warming effect of the ocean. 
</p><p>Sydney has air conditioning in all public buildings, and on most public transport. These days it is increasingly rare to have to catch a bus or train without air conditioning on a hot day. Nevertheless, carry water during summer and remember sun protection year round.

<p>Every year since 1998, Sydney has held the Sydney Writers' Festival. This festival features over 300 events and brings in an audience of over 100,000. This non-profit festival brings together some of the world's best fiction and nonfiction writers, screenwriters and even musicians, scientists and journalists. At its core, however, the festival's purpose is to celebrate literature. While the festival is designed to highlight writers and performers from around the world, Sydney itself has many reasons to be proud where literature is concerned.
</p>
<ul><li>Award-winning author and journalist <b>Ruth Park</b> was born in New Zealand in 1917 and moved to Australia in 1942. Shortly after her marriage to an Australian-born author, she and her husband settled in Sydney. One of her best known books, <b>The Harp in the South</b> (which later became the second book in a trilogy) was published in 1948 and is still considered a favorite read today. When published, the book, which is set in a Sydney slum, was declared by critics to be a work of pure fantasy because they did not believe slums existed in Sydney. Park, however, based the setting on the very real slum in which she and her husband lived.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Voss</b> was written by <b>Patrick White</b>, who was awarded the 1973 Nobel Prize in Literature. White grew up in Australia, was educated in England, and permanently settled in Australia after World War II. <b>Voss</b> is the story of an explorer (Voss) who sets out to cross Australia while his beloved remains behind in Sydney.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ride on Stranger</b> is set in post-World War II Sydney. Its Australian author, <b>Kylie Tennant</b>, is best known for her realistic yet upbeat portrayals of Australia's underclass.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>In a Sunburned Country</b> is written by American travel writer <b>Bill Bryson</b>. Bryson makes no bones about his deep and abiding love for Australia and all-things Australian. He devotes a portion of this book to his experiences in Sydney.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Award-winning author <b>Marele Day</b> was born and raised in modern-day Sydney. Several of her books feature the Sydney-based female (and feminist) private investigator Claudia Valentine.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Schindler's Ark</b> was written by Australian-author <b>Thomas Keneally</b>. It was published in 1982 and was the basis for the movie <i>Schindler's List</i>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Australia's two best known historical works are <b>A Commonwealth of Thieves: The Story of the Founding of Australia"</b> by <b>Thomas Keneally</b> and <b>The Fatal Shore</b> by <b>Robert Hughes</b>. While both books focus on the time when convicts were regularly transported to Australia, the two authors assume extremely different tones. Keneally looks to provide readers with a middle-of-the road approach. His goal is to help readers understand this part of Australia's past. Hughes, on the other hand, has no time for niceties. He prefers writing in extremes and happily condemns his homeland for attempting to ignore this part of their past.</li></ul>

They range from the simple Francis Greenway's Georgian buildings to Jorn Utzon’s Expressionist Sydney Opera House. Sydney also has a large amount of Victorian buildings, such as the Sydney Town Hall and the Queen Victoria Building.

The eastern suburb of <a href="/en/Sydney/City_East" title="Sydney/City East">Paddington</a> is known for its terrace houses, while several inner-west suburbs contain streets lined with so-called federation houses (built around the time of Australian federation in 1901). Probably the best preserved example of federation houses in Sydney is in the Inner West suburb of Burwood. Appian Way is a circular street built around lawn tennis courts complete with pavilion house. The large houses are all architecturally unique and built on large expanses of land featuring old trees and lovely gardens. Further away on the lower <a href="/en/Sydney/North_Shore" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/North Shore">North Shore</a>, Castlecrag is a unique suburb, being planned by the architect Walter Burley Griffin in the 1930s.

<p>Check which terminal you are going to.
</p><p>International terminal (T1) handles all international flights and some domestic flights. Check your itinerary and flight number because check-in, connections and customs will take longer when arriving or departing from the International Terminal, even on a domestic flight. You do not need a passport when travelling domestically, just hang on to your boarding pass.
</p><p>Domestic terminal 2 (T2) is the largest domestic terminal. Airlines using this terminal include Regional Express (Rex), Jetstar, Tiger and Virgin Australia<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/plan/destinations/flights-to-sydney/">[3]</a>.
</p><p>Domestic terminal 3 (T3) handles <a href="/en/Qantas" title="Qantas">Qantas</a> and Qantaslink domestic flights numbered from QF400 and above which are mostly services to larger cities and towns as well as to many smaller regional centres.
</p>

<p>T1 (International terminal) has food and shopping both before and after immigration and security.   There is an open air beer garden and bistro by check-in Bay A on the departure level.  There are cafes on both departure and arrival levels.  Good coffee and food can had for a reasonable price, but it is easy to buy poor overpriced coffee and food too.  Departures has cheaper prices than downstairs at arrivals.  There is a better and cheaper choice of food before going through security, at the large central food hall in departures.  Avoid currency exchange offices (see the <a href="#Currency_exchange">Currency exchange</a> section). Two free showers for both males and females are available by check-in bay A on the departures level.  There is also an open air observation deck, with the entrance next to check-in bay B on the departures level, through the bistro and up the elevator.  A post office is in the check-in area, but it is only open during business hours.  Post boxes are available after customs.  There is a large duty free shop selling alcohol, cigarettes, perfume and electronics available when departing and arriving.  There are some free Internet terminals in departures, even a few before security.  There are paid Internet terminals there too and downstairs in arrivals.  Trolleys cost money landside of security.  Pick one up airside where they are free, or out in the carpark where they have been left by previous users.
</p><p>T2 has a large food and shopping area, with a large selection of food outlets located to the right after you go through security.  There are also gift shops, bookshops and some clothing stores.  There are nice views over the tarmac from the eating area.  There are ATMs before and after security.  Everyone is able to go through security, whether travelling or not. 
</p><p>T3 (Qantas domestic) has a food hall with a variety of food and coffee.  Nice Thai is available for around $15 or Hungry Jacks for normal prices.  The food hall is airside of security, but you do not need to be a passenger to pass through.  Most food and drink places and the security checkpoint close 30 minutes or so before the last departure.  Don't expect to be able to get anything at all if you are arriving on a late flight.  Don't expect people to be able to get to the gate to meet you on a late arrival as they will have to wait at baggage claim if you arrive after the last departure.  There is free Wi-Fi and Internet terminals available for $5 per hour.

<p>Due to curfew laws, no planes arrive or depart between 11PM and 5:30AM.  The domestic terminals (T2 and T3) close after the last flight has cleared (around 11PM) and reopen at 4AM - you cannot remain in the terminal.  T1 (international) also closes around 11PM and reopens at 4AM - but there is small transit area with basic facilities that you can remain in if you are already in the terminal (landside). This is located on level 1 near the entrance to the train station. There are limited seats and it fills up quickly when security starts herding people out of the terminal. The last train service departs at 11:45PM.

<p>Transfer between domestic terminals T2 and T3 must be done on foot. Follow the signs either via the railway station underground, or across the car park.
</p><p>Transfer between T1 and T2/T3 is 4 km by road, as the terminals are on opposite sides of the airport tarmac. You will have to use one of the following methods to transfer:
</p>
<ul><li>An <b>Air-side shuttle</b> is available free of charge if you are connecting through with Qantas or a One World partner airline. Passengers transferring Virgin Australia and a codeshare flight or other international Virgin Flight (United Airlines, Virgin Atlantic Airways and Hawaiian Airlines) are entitled for a free pass on the T-bus (see below).</li>
<li>If you aren't entitled to a free shuttle, your best bet is to catch a <b>suburban train</b> ($5.40). It is a 2 minute journey between Domestic and International stations with around 10 minute frequency. Follow the train signs from the terminal and board any train on platform 1 for International to Domestic transfers and any train on platform 2 for domestic to international.  Travel <b>one stop</b> only, as the train continues to the city or into suburban Sydney.</li>
<li><b>T-bus</b> (complimentary shuttle bus) outside the terminal building. The T-bus is a dedicated terminal shuttle and uses the normal roads. It is scheduled to take around 10 minutes but can be stuck in Sydney traffic at peak times. Runs at a 10-20 minute frequency and you pay the driver on boarding. This method is slower and slightly more expensive than the train, but it stops close to the terminal and has plenty of room for baggage.</li>
<li><b>Sydney Buses</b> ($3.50) T1 yellow bus stop outside the arrivals, or outside T3 at domestic. It is possible to use the ordinary city bus service to transfer between terminals with the same speed as the T-bus, albeit with less frequent departures and less luggage space. T1 to T2/T3 take the 400 towards Bondi Junction. T2/T3 to T1 take the 400 towards Burwood.  There is only one stop for buses going both directions, and catching the bus going the wrong way will again send you off into suburban Sydney.</li>
<li><b>Taxi</b> ($10). The trip will take around 10 minutes, though the wait for taxis can be long at peak times. Drivers may also give you attitude as they have to line up for a long time and generally want bigger fares.</li>
<li><b>Walk</b>.  To walk between the domestic and international terminals will take around an hour. There is an uncovered road footpath and planes taking off metres above your head. From T1 walk across the car park, across the crossing, under the underpass, and follow the Airport Drive footpath/cycleway to the right (east), keeping the Alexandra Canal on your left, and airport on your right. From T2/T3 follow the road out of the airport, and turn left onto Qantas drive, and keep the airport on your left.</li></ul>

<p>Sydney Airport is 9km from the city centre and reaching the city centre or other suburbs is easy, whether it be by suburban rail, bus or car. If you're going to the city centre the following methods are your best bet:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Suburban trains</b> operated by Sydney Trains <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sydneytrains.info">[4]</a> depart frequently from Domestic and International rail stations, which are connected to the airline terminals via lifts and pedestrian subways. An Adult Opal card fare is $16.38 peak, $15.36 off peak), which includes an airport station surcharge (<i>Airport Station Access Fee</i>) of $12. The airport is located on the T2 Airport Line and is served by a train every 10 minutes during off-peak, and every 7 minutes during peak. Passengers for the city centre should take a train from Platform 1. The trains are used by commuters during peak hours, so at these times you are unlikely to get a seat. Travelling closer to the front or back of the train, rather than the middle, will increase your chances of a comfortable journey.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Local buses</b>. If you want to skip the Airport Station Access fee, an option is to take the 400 local bus route towards Bondi Junction. This bus stops about 200m from the Mascot suburban rail station, which is one train-stop from the Domestic Airport but free from the airport fee. Walk out of the Mascot rail station (heading south), cross the street at the light, and continue walking straight - it will be on the left side of the street. The bus costs $3.50 and the train $3.38 for peak hours, $2.36 off-peak with an Opal card. If you're travelling from the domestic terminal, the M20 bus will take you to Central, Wynyard, Town Hall and North Sydney stations. At the airport, the bus stops are located outside T1 and T3 (but not T2). There is only limited luggage space on the bus, but if you can manage backpacks or suitcases by yourself it should not be a problem. Total cost from local Bus no 400 fares from Domestic/Intl Airport to Mascot station plus a Train ride from Mascot station to Central station will cost you around&#160;: Using Opal Card - Peak fare $3.74 or Off peak fare $2.67 - This will cost the same the other way around from Central - Mascot - Domestic/Intl Airport</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Shuttle Bus</b>  will drive passengers to the city and deliver them to the door of their hotel. You can buy a ticket for a shuttle bus to your hotel from the information desk at T1 or T3 for $18. The cheaper option is to book online in advance, which will be around $12.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Taxis</b> to the city centre should cost approximately $40 (including tolls), and more to other Sydney destinations (The Rocks $40-45, North Sydney $45, Manly $50, Parramatta $80-100 etc.) You can expect to pay a $3.80 airport taxi levy and a $5.50 Eastern Distributor toll on top of the metered fare.  If you are arriving on a Friday evening, you may face a long queue for taxis. Asking the driver to take O'Riordan Street is a little slower but shorter and cheaper than the Eastern Distributor tollway which frequently experiences traffic congestion during peak times.</li></ul>
<p>Be warned of Taxi drivers taking you the long way from the airport to CBD. Request to travel via Alexandria or Redfern than on the highway. Also be warned about increasing taxi scams. It is illegal for drivers not to use the meter. Also beware of drivers charging a Maxi taxi tariff (only applicable if 5 or more passengers are carried in an appropriate vehicle with 6 seats or more). Even if a 7 seater vehicle carries your party of 1-4 passengers regardless of amount of luggage, only the standard tariff is applicable. If there is any suspicion of overcharging, insist on a receipt, take a photo of the driver's identification on front windscreen, and the taxi's registration plate and ring the New South Wales Taxi Fare Hotline on 1800 500 410 (free call). If it is valid, they will organise a refund of inappropriate charges. Consider prepaid options such as Uber or a taxi company app to avoid issues e.g. 13CABS app.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Uber</b> are now (but weren't previously) allowed to pick passengers up from the passenger pick up areas - follow the signs marked from the airport exit. These will be significantly cheaper than regular taxis and sometimes more comfortable, depending on your luck.  Uber services on the short trip to the CBD are generally more welcoming. Most of the time, Uber picks up from the priority pick up green zone. This is exactly half way between the Virgin Australia / Jetstar and Qantas Domestic Terminal.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Vehicle rental</b> is available at all  terminals from a variety of rental companies. After you rent a vehicle, you will be directed to pick it up at a parking space in the adjacent parking garage.  You return the vehicle to the same area.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Having someone pick you up</b>.  At T1 (International), a private car can not stop legally at the arrivals area to pick up someone from the curb.  If you exit the car park within 15 minutes, it is free, otherwise it is $7 per half hour.  At T3 (domestic terminals), cars can stop at the pickup area only if there is someone already at the kerb. At T2, there is a pick up area inside the paid car park. Follow the yellow stenciled signs outside the terminal.  Car park charges apply if you stay longer that 10 minutes.  Fines apply for waiting at the arrivals areas or for picking up at the departures areas. Leaving your car is out of the question. The parking officers can photograph your car and licence plate and fine you without warning you to move along.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Walk and train from T1</b>. T1 (the international terminal) is less than 2km from Wolli Creek Station, from where a train to the city costs $4.20 peak and $2.94 during off-peak hours with an Adult Opal card. As of December 2017, a new pedestrian and bicycle bridge to the Marsh Street bridge has opened. Exit straight from the international terminal (T1), follow the pedestrian path to the P7 parkade. Head to section 1D (west side) where the bridge starts. Follow the bridge until it take you to a path along the river. Follow the path up to your right around and back over the path you just walked on up to the Marsh Street bridge. Cross the Cooks River on the footpath on the right of Marsh St. At the end of the bridge's fence turn a sharp right (north) down a slight hill and through a pedestrian crossing and then proceed along the brick cycleway through the park and along Cooks River (signposted to Tempe), keeping the river on your right. Near the northeast corner of the park cut across the corner of the park to the park's carpark. When you reach the Princes Hwy (6 lane road), cross at the pedestrian crossing lights. This is about in the middle of the park's carpark and runs along the east side of Woolworth's grocery store. At the northeast corner of the Woolworths (loading docks) is a roundabout. Take the road to the right (north) and the station entrance will be on the left (west). The walk will take about 20 minutes and will save you $12 (<b>airport fee</b>) on the train fare. Trains from Wolli Creek are even more frequent than from the airport since Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra line trains also stop there.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Walk and train from T2 &amp; T3</b>. The Domestic terminals (T2 and T3) are about 1.7km from Mascot train station. The walk along suburban pavements takes about 20 minutes. Follow the road out of the domestic terminal and on to O'Riordan Street. Follow O'Riordan Street and then veer left onto Bourke Street. Cross Coward Street and then John Street, Mascot train station is on your right. An adult fare to the city (Central) from Mascot is $4.20 peak and $2.36 off-peak with an Opal card.</li></ul>

<p>It is possible to drive to Sydney from <a href="/en/Brisbane" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> or <a href="/en/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in a full day, around 8.5 hours non-stop to Melbourne or 11.5 hours to Brisbane on the most direct routes. A comfortable drive would allow two days from Melbourne or Brisbane, and three to <a href="/en/Adelaide" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. The Melbourne drive is dual carriageway high quality road. The same can't be said for the Brisbane drive, which while it has high quality sections, it also has some very narrow winding sections, carries high traffic volumes, and has many stoppages from roadworks.

The Pacific Highway passes through more towns, attractions, and has more facilities compared with the New England Highway, but it can get congested moving through the towns around holiday times.  Although the Pacific Highway route follows the coast, you won't see the ocean except for some brief glimpses.  There are rivers all the way up the coast, and the river mouths are wide, causing the road bridges and the towns to be a little inland. If you have time, look for the tourist route diversions to see more of the <a href="/en/Mid-North_Coast" title="Mid-North Coast">Mid-North Coast</a> and <a href="/en/Northern_Rivers" title="Northern Rivers">Northern Rivers</a> on the way down (the beaches will be less crowded than Sydney!).</li></ul>
<p>If you are renting a car, check the daily distance allowances and any one-way charge that may apply when driving from less popular destinations to major cities. Cars may be rented at the airport and elsewhere from major rental companies, or at smaller, less conveniently located, cheaper companies.
</p><p>Ride-sharing can be arranged with other travellers. You can find a wide range of carpool offers on the Internet or in hostel noticeboards, etc. Usual warnings apply.
</p><p>There are tolls applicable to most motorways coming into Sydney, and all tolling is electronic - no cash is accepted. See "Tolls" section below.

<p>The New South Wales long distance train service <b>NSW TrainLink</b>, (13 22 32 within Australia) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://nswtrainlink.info/">[5]</a> runs at least daily services to Sydney from <a href="/en/Brisbane" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="/en/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="/en/Canberra" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> and many regions of <a href="/en/New_South_Wales" title="New South Wales">New South Wales</a> including the <a href="/en/Mid-North_Coast" title="Mid-North Coast">Mid-North Coast</a>, <a href="/en/New_England_(New_South_Wales)" title="New England (New South Wales)">New England</a>, the <a href="/en/Central_West_(New_South_Wales)" title="Central West (New South Wales)">Central West</a> and the <a href="/en/Southern_Highlands_(New_South_Wales)" title="Southern Highlands (New South Wales)">Southern Highlands</a>. It also services <a href="/en/Broken_Hill" title="Broken Hill">Broken Hill</a> weekly. Travelling time from Melbourne and Brisbane is around 12 hours. Fares range between $30 and $100 for standard class seats, and reservations tickets can be purchased online, by phone, or at the station. The long distance trains between Melbourne and Sydney, and Brisbane and Sydney can be a less stressful alternative to driving, but they do not average particularly high speeds and take longer than flying. It is often possible to get a discount airfare around the same price or cheaper than the adult train fare.
</p><p>The <b>Indian Pacific</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gsr.com.au/indian/">[6]</a> (13 21 47 within Australia or +61 8 8213 4592 internationally) train service runs from <a href="/en/Perth_(Western_Australia)" class="mw-redirect" title="Perth (Western Australia)">Perth</a> to Sydney via <a href="/en/Adelaide" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> and <a href="/en/Broken_Hill" title="Broken Hill">Broken Hill</a>. Adult fares from Perth are $1250 for a sleeper cabin. Children's fares are $805 for a sleeper cabin. The train departs from Perth on Wednesdays and arrives at Sydney on Saturdays. These fares are much higher than return plane fares to Perth, this journey is really for train journey enthusiasts who want to see the interior of Australia. It also gives you the ability to take your car on the train for an additional fee, although car carrying is no longer available from Sydney (you will need to drive or get your car taken to Adelaide).
</p><p>All long distance (NSW TrainLink and Great Southern Railway) trains to Sydney terminate at platforms 1-3 of Sydney's <b>Central Station</b> in the south of the <a href="/en/Sydney/City" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">CBD</a> area. Travellers can transfer to Sydney trains, the light rail service to <a href="/en/Sydney/Darling_Harbour" title="Sydney/Darling Harbour">Darling Harbour</a>, city buses, as well as taxis. It is also easy to transfer to other long distance trains and coaches.  There is short term metered parking so you can meet the trains on the platform.  There are ATM's, a small choice of food outlets, cafes open until late, and a railway heritage society display and a bookshop in the terminal.
</p><p><b>NSW TrainLink</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nswtrainlink.info/">[7]</a> also runs services several times a day from close regional cities: <a href="/en/Newcastle_(New_South_Wales)" title="Newcastle (New South Wales)">Newcastle</a> via the <a href="/en/Central_Coast_(New_South_Wales)" title="Central Coast (New South Wales)">Central Coast (New South Wales)</a>, <a href="/en/Goulburn" title="Goulburn">Goulburn</a> via the <a href="/en/Southern_Highlands_(New_South_Wales)" title="Southern Highlands (New South Wales)">Southern Highlands</a>, <a href="/en/Kiama" title="Kiama">Kiama</a> via the <a href="/en/South_Coast_(New_South_Wales)" title="South Coast (New South Wales)">South Coast</a> and <a href="/en/Lithgow" title="Lithgow">Lithgow</a> via the <a href="/en/Blue_Mountains" title="Blue Mountains">Blue Mountains</a>.

<p>As of 2012, Google Maps can also be used to plan Sydney public transport routes. Using google maps is a foolproof way to access public transport. It provides real time information and tailors train lines to which stops you want to get off at, to stop the possibility of accidentally getting on an express train. 
</p><p>Public transport in Sydney has historically been poorly integrated and the ticket system was confusing, though this has been alleviated with the introduction of the Opal Card (see below).
</p><p>If in doubt check with a driver or station attendant as transit officers do not accept any excuses and you'll be stuck with a $200 fine.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Opal_Card">Opal Card</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sydney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25" title="Edit section: Opal Card">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p><i>In 2014 Sydney implemented a new stored-value card, like London's Oyster Card or the Hong Kong Octopus card. This is called the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.opal.com.au/"><b>Opal Card</b></a>.</i>
</p><p>The Opal card is a touch-and-go contactless card that you pre-load with value. The major advantage of the Opal card is that one ticket will work on all modes of transport and that your fares are automatically calculated. For travellers it holds an extra bonus in that after eight paid journeys have been attained, all further travel for the week is half-price. Once a designated weekly maximum spend (as of February 2017, $60) has been reached, all further travel for that week is 50% off. Additionally, there is a $15.00 daily cap to how much you can spend ($2.50 cap on Sundays), which is especially useful if you wish to see the outlying areas of the city on a low budget. There is a $2 discount for each transfer between modes made within 60 minutes of the last tap off - e.g. train $4.20 + bus $2.10 = $6.30 - $2 transfer discount = $4.30. There is also a 30% discount on train fares when travelling off-peak (peak period is 7-9am and 4-6.30pm on weekdays). Different peak periods apply to some outer suburban stations (Lithgow for instance has a 6-6.45am and 4-6.30pm peak).
</p><p>Definitions of Opal travel terms:
Trip: travel on one route, on one mode. When you transfer to another route or service, you are commencing a new trip.
Journey: consists of one or more trips on eligible services where transfers between services occur within 60 minutes.
Transfer: occurs at the end of a single trip. It is a change of transport mode or route, to another service or route, to continue a journey. Transfers made within a standard transfer time of 60 minutes combine trips into a single journey.
</p><p>Cards can be bought through the official website or at over 1000 retailers throughout the city.
</p><p>To use the Opal card you hold it against the card reader until the reader 'dings' and then do the same again when you get off the bus or exit the ticket gates. This enables the system to calculate how far you travelled and deduct the appropriate amount from your card balance. If you forget to 'tap off' you are charged a 'default fare' that assumes you travelled the maximum possible distance on that mode of transport - which may be significantly more than fare you would have paid if you had 'tapped off' appropriately. 
</p><p>Opal readers are at the doors of buses, on ferry wharves, on ticket barriers at major train stations and on free-standing poles near the entrances to outer-suburban train stations that do not have barriers.
</p><p>The Opal card covers all the railway network, ferries, buses and light rail. The coverage of the Opal card is vast to say the least - not only does it encompass Sydney, <a href="/en/Newcastle_(New_South_Wales)" title="Newcastle (New South Wales)">Newcastle</a> and all places in between, it is now valid for all train services as far as <a href="/en/Goulburn" title="Goulburn">Goulburn</a> (225km to the south of Sydney), <a href="/en/Bathurst_(New_South_Wales)" title="Bathurst (New South Wales)">Bathurst</a> (240km to the west) and Scone (some 315km to the north).
</p><p>Though the card itself is 'free', it can only be topped up in multiples of $10 - and getting a refund for the unused credit is cumbersome - requiring you to download a form from their website and then sending it back along with the Opal Cards to an address in Australia. The refund is then sent by cheque.

<p><b>As of 1 August 2016, all paper tickets except Opal single-trip tickets have been discontinued.</b>
</p><p>Travellers doing a one-off trip through Sydney that need to catch public transport can purchase a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.opal.com.au/en/get-an-opal-card/opal-single-trip-tickets/"><b>Opal Single Trip Ticket</b></a>. These are more expensive than Opal fares and no concession fares are available (except for children or youth under 16). Any person travelling through Sydney for more than a brief trip is advised to purchase an Opal Card. You can buy single trip tickets at machines at most stations in Sydney and the Opal network on the same machines where you can top up an Opal card.

<p>Sydney has a vast suburban rail network operated by <b>Sydney Trains</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sydneytrains.info/">[9]</a>, covering 882km of track and 176 stations. The train network will take passengers to most of the metropolitan area, with the exception of the north-west (which can be accessed by the Sydney Metro) and northern beaches. Trains service every station in the metropolitan area at least every 30 minutes (except for the Carlingford line)  Frequency is higher in the city, and major centres (Chatswood, Parramatta, Bondi Junction, etc) usually see a train every 10 minutes or so.  Peak times (7AM-9:30AM and 4:30PM-7PM) have more frequent 5 minute and also crowded trains, as well as some express services that skip more stations.  Expect congestion around Central, Town Hall and Wynyard. Please be aware that the Sydney Trains network is prone to delays, due to mechanical failure issues and weather conditions, so it is recommended that you check the Opal website or app, for any such announcements. 
</p><p>All of the Sydney Trains network operates double deck trains, with ample seating and narrow staircases which you may be forced to stand on during peak times. In the centre of the city and eastern suburbs trains will proceed into underground stations, with around 14 stations with underground platforms. 
</p><p>There are different styles and ages of trains running on the network. Most often, you will get a clean modern train, all trains are air-conditioned some with comfortable seating and clear station announcements. Alternatively, you could get a train like packed in like sardines in the afternoon peak, with station announcements that are barely audible, if at all. Prepare yourself with a network map or use google maps. 
</p><p>Most train services <b>do not stop</b> at every station and do not travel to the furthest extent of the line.  Look at the departure screens at the station concourse which indicate when the next train will arrive, its destination, the platform it will depart from, and the stations it will stop at. Alternatively, you can also listen to announcements that will regularly play before and when a train arrives at the platform.  Or if you have mobile Internet services use the Transport Info trip planner.
</p><p>Outside of operating hours, between midnight (1AM on Fridays and Saturdays) and 5AM, <b>NightRide buses</b> run at least every hour. Any  train ticket is valid for the equivalent NightRide bus except a single. If you have no ticket, you must buy a NightRide single from the driver, which is more expensive than a single for the train. NightRide buses stop at most stations and a few additional stops, but they do not travel on the same routes. If you intend catching a NightRide bus home, check the NightRide route map on the back cover of each timetable, or with the Transport Infoline.  Buses can be crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. 
</p><p>Exercise caution whilst travelling on trains after 8pm, particularly if the carriage is mostly deserted and if travelling to greater western Sydney, as it is not uncommon for undesirables to be found on trains during these times. 99% of the time they will not cause you any more trouble other than being loud, vulgar and obnoxious, but it is best to avoid them as unwanted altercations may follow. Moving to other carriages would be a good idea. Otherwise, travel in the middle carriage with the train guard (marked with a blue light). The guard has contact with police and the driver if there is any trouble on the train.
</p><p>On weekends, check for trackwork before leaving for the station; Sydney Trains will transfer passengers to buses if lines are closed for trackwork, and the process will add at least half an hour to a typical journey. Trackwork is common on weekends and will be advertised at the station and the Sydney Trains website for about a week before it begins. You need the same Sydney Trains ticket for the trackwork buses as you would for the train.

<p>Sydney has an extensive bus network. Some buses run from distant suburbs such as those on the Northern Beaches and North West all the way to the city, but there are also shorter feeders to suburban rail stations from surrounding suburbs. Buses are operated by the government-owned Sydney Buses in the inner suburbs bounded by Miranda in the South, Bankstown in the South-West, Parramatta in the west, Beecroft in the North-West and Palm Beach in the North. Outside of these area, various privately owned companies are contracted by the government to operate public bus services.
</p><p>It is a good idea to plan your bus trips in advance where possible. The Sydney Buses website has a helpful trip planner feature to assist you, as well as route maps and schedules to print. Buses are far less regular at night, and there are only <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.transportnsw.info/en/travelling-with-us/using-public-transport/night-travel/night-buses.page?">a small number of routes</a> that run 24 hours, so if you're planning on staying out late, keep this in mind.
</p><p>Most bus stops have timetables posted, as well as a route map for the routes servicing that bus stop.
</p><p>You must flag down buses with an outstretched hand if you want them to stop for you and you must press the STOP button on board to disembark. They will not automatically stop unless they are signalled to do so.
</p><p>On most buses there is nothing on the bus to tell you which stop you are approaching or which stop you are at.  There are no poster maps on the bus either. If you are not sure where you are getting off, pick up or print out the timetable (found on the Sydney Buses website), which has a route map on it and watch for landmarks as you pass - and don't be scared to ask. Also, if you take a bus marked "Limited Stops" or "Express" (the route number will start with an L or an X), make sure that the bus stops where you want it to. Limited stops services stop only at major stops so they may make you walk around 750 metres or so if they skip your stop. However, express services can run very far from the city without stopping at all, before resuming a normal stopping pattern (express buses only operate during peak hours). All normally numbered buses stop at all stops, so missing your stop or getting off one stop early is a less serious mistake.  Red Metrobuses (routes numbers starting with M) are longer route, cross city buses, running at 10-20 minute frequencies during their operational hours. These buses also have a screen displaying the next stop and onboard announcements as well (though don't count on them working). Metrobus stops usually have a name on top of the stand which easily indicates a Metrobus services the particular stop.
</p><p>There are two main bus termination points in the <a href="/en/Sydney/City" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">CBD</a>, at Wynyard and Circular Quay. These two points are separated by a one-stop commuter train trip. You will need to make this trip if connecting from buses arriving from north of the harbour bridge to buses heading east or west, or vice versa. Bus information centres are located at both Wynyard and Circular Quay.
</p><p>If you don't have an Opal Card, you can buy a single ticket on the bus, except if you are in the City area, Bondi Junction, Parramatta Rd, Norton Street, Anzac Parade, Military Road or on most of the limited stop services or M10, M20, M30, M40, and M50 Metrobus routes or any other pre-pay bus services during peak times which run through the city (which are done to help buses run on time). There are three distance based fare bands. Drivers in non-prepay buses in may be able to give change for a $20 note, but it is best to use only coins and lower-denomination notes.
</p><p>A few trunk routes run to the Eastern Suburbs and to Newtown 24 hours a day. Additional services operate late Friday and Saturday night to the Northern Beaches and to the North West.

<p>Sydney Metro is a 33 Kilometre metro rail line running from the Lower North Shore to the North West of Sydney. it is a mostly underground single deck subway line running from Chatswood via Epping to Tallawong. You will most likely not need to use this service as it stops at no desirable places for tourists and really just serves as a line for commuters. An Opal card can be used on this service just like at any normal Sydney Train station. There will be less seating on these trains as they are single deck and will be crowded during peak times.

</p><p>Trips to <a href="/en/Sydney/Inner_West" title="Sydney/Inner West">Balmain</a> and <a href="/en/Sydney/Darling_Harbour" title="Sydney/Darling Harbour">Darling Harbour</a> offer other great excuses to take a ferry trip under the Harbour Bridge.
</p><p>At peak periods the Parramatta River ferries can fill to capacity, and you should ensure that you have an alternative for completing your trip.  Passenger counts are strictly enforced.  Peak periods are weekends around 4PM-6PM at <a href="/en/Sydney/Parramatta" title="Sydney/Parramatta">Parramatta</a> and Circular Quay, and school holiday weekdays 4PM-6PM at Darling Harbour (heading to Parramatta) (you are okay if you board at Circular Quay, where the ferry originates).  The Manly and inner-harbour ferries can get busy, but it is very rare that they reach capacity.
</p><p>Opal fares are calculated in two zones - for trips under 10km and trips over 10km respectively. The cheaper fare covers anywhere to the east of the Harbour Bridge except Manly, which is a higher fare. Note that many ferry wharves do not have a ticket machine.

<p>Sydney Fast Ferries and Manly Fast Ferries run a competing services against the government owned Sydney Ferries.  Both Sydney Fast Ferries and Manly Fast Ferries runs a service between Circular Quay and Manly.

<p>There is about 25km of light rail in Sydney with 3 lines. These can all be accessed via central station. Light rail line L1 can be accessed via the grand concourse opposite the main platforms. Light rail lines L2 and L3 can be accessed via Chalmers street, a short 1 minute walk from the grand concourse. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.transportnsw.info/sites/en/maps-and-timetables/light-rail.page">[10]</a> L1 is useful for travelling between <a href="/en/Sydney/City" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">Sydney City</a> and western <a href="/en/Sydney/Darling_Harbour" title="Sydney/Darling Harbour">Darling Harbour</a>, the casino, and Pyrmont, and runs from Central to Dulwich Hill. L2 is useful when travelling to Qircular Quay and Randwick. L3 is useful when travelling to Circular Quay and Kinsford. You can use Opal Cards on the network and Opal Single Trip Tickets are sold at most but not all of the light rail stops. 
</p><p>The light rail is convenient for western Darling Harbour and its sights, but you will most likely use it a lot less than other forms of transport.

<p>Sydney traffic is always busy, but outside of peak weekday times travelling by car is usually at least as quick as any method of public transport. Congestion can be expected on roads to the city 6:30AM-9:30AM, and roads away from the city 4:30PM-6:30PM.  Allow double the normal travel time during these periods - longer if you are using motorways. Congestion is considerably worse and longer in both directions during the Friday afternoon peak, or when there are special events such as Vivid Sydney or State of Origin rugby matches.  Some roads experience congestion at other times and roads heading to shopping, sports, parks and beaches can be heavily congested on weekends also - particularly on Saturday mornings and Saturday evenings. Roads around Bondi Beach and the other eastern suburbs beaches experience gridlock on summer weekends, with buses often caught in the same traffic as cars.
</p><p>Roads are generally well signposted to the next major suburb or suburbs along the route. Only a handful of cross-city 'A' and 'B' roads are signposted by number.  The airport is signposted from many major routes with an aeroplane symbol.
</p><p>Travel times from the <a href="/en/Sydney/City" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">city centre</a> to the Sydney outskirts can take around an hour in good traffic.

<p>Due to the sandstone beneath Sydney, most highways in the central city will be underground. These tunnels help maintain the city landscape and avoid the demolition of buildings. There are various tunnels scattered around Sydney, including the Eastern Distributor, the Cross City Tunnel, the Lane Cove tunnel, the M4 tunnel, the M5 tunnel, the M8 tunnel, and the underwater Sydney Harbour tunnel. Use of all these tunnels requires the electronic payment of a toll, see below to figure out how to do that. There is an underground spaghetti junction between the Cross City and eastern distributor tunnels, this can be hard to navigate so keep a look out. 
</p><p>As of late 2020, the Northconnex M1 tunnel will open, which is a 9km tunnel in the north of Sydney. Keep in mind, if you choose to hire even a small truck in Sydney and drive up the coast, you MUST use this tunnel and pay the $25 toll instead of the above A28 Cumberland Highway or Pennant Hills road. use of these roads in a Truck or Lorry will incur a fine. 
</p><p>In 2023 The largest underground spaghetti junction in the world called Rozelle Interchange will be built in Sydney, which will inevitably be impossible to navigate through. Keep this in mind while driving in the inner west if you plan to go to the city after 2023. Luckily for now, we don't have to worry about that.

<p>All motorways, all tunnels and some bridges charge tolls.
</p><p>As of July 1, 2013, you can no longer pay in cash anywhere on the Sydney Orbital Network. 
The Harbour Bridge and Tunnel, Cross City Tunnel, Lane Cove Tunnel, M7, M5, and the Falcon Street northbound motorway entrance only use <b>electronic tolling</b> and if you use these you need to decide how you will pay the toll.   You can easily avoid the Lane Cove Tunnel, M7 or Falcon Street on-ramp, however, it is hard to avoid the harbour crossings if you are going to <a href="/en/Manly" class="mw-redirect" title="Manly">Manly</a>, the <a href="/en/Northern_Beaches" class="mw-redirect" title="Northern Beaches">Northern Beaches</a> or the zoo by car.
</p><p>Your choice is to have a <b>pass</b> or a <b>tag</b>.
</p>
<ul><li>A <b>pass</b> (also called an <b>e-pass</b>) is the simplest way to pay tolls.  Just register your licence plate and credit card up to 48 hours <i>after</i> travelling on a toll road and tolls will be deducted automatically from your card.  The Sydney Motorways website <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://sydneymotorways.com/tagsandpasses.html">[11]</a> provides links to pass providers.  The cost is $1.50 to register online, and 75c on top of each toll as a processing charge.  Make sure you enter the dates you will be in charge of the car, so you don't end up paying for someone else's toll.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A <b>tag</b> (also called an <b>E-tag</b>) is a transponder stuck to the inside of your windscreen.  You can purchase a visitor's <b>tag</b>  from any motor registry <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www1.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?fuseaction=motorregistries.all">[12]</a> <i>before</i> travelling on a toll road for $5 and set up an account linked to your credit card.   Allow about 30 minutes at the registry to sort it all out.  It is worthwhile considering only if you are staying in Sydney for a while or travelling on toll roads in <a href="/en/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="/en/Brisbane" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> as well. You will end up ahead only if you need to pay six or more toll charges.</li></ul>
<p>A capital 'E' marked on the lane indicates it accepts a tag and a lower case 'e' indicates it accepts a pass.
</p><p>Not paying a toll incurs a $10-$15 administration fee in additional to the toll.  If you are in a rental car, the rental car company will charge an additional fee for this to your credit card.
</p><p>Some rental car companies, for example Avis, supply an etag with each car, and a service fee for each day it is used.  You have no option to buy your pass or tag.  Others, for example Bayswater, give you an option to rent one from them for a fixed fee, and you have a choice to obtain your own pass as an alternative.  Check with your rental company.

<p>Parking your car in the <a href="/en/Sydney/City_Centre" title="Sydney/City Centre">City Centre</a> in parking stations is always possible but <i>very</i> expensive. Expect to pay up to $70 per day or $25 per hour at some central parking lots and around $30 even with specials on weekdays. Prices generally reduce significantly on weekends however, and you may only pay $15 - $20 or so for a full day's parking. Reduced parking charges are also made for early bird parking, where you must enter and leave within prescribed times.  For example you can park all day at the Opera House <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.wilsonparking.com.au/go/wilson-car-parks/nsw/sydney-opera-house">[13]</a> for $16 provides you enter before 10AM and leave 3PM-7PM. There is no grace period, so you cannot get out even one minute before 3PM, and you will be charged the day parking rate of $42 if you are 10 seconds late.  Most city parking lots offer reduced flat fees (around $15-$25) for evening and weekend parking.
</p><p>Street parking in the CBD is generally only possible before 8AM and after 6:30PM. on weekdays and, even then, is almost invariably metered until 10PM at $2.20-3.30 per hour. On weekends, most parking spaces have a 4 hour limit, again metered at $1.10-2.20 per hour. All day street spots are sometimes available in the Domain/Mrs Macquarie's Chair and Hickson Road, but these spots are often taken up by commuters, and, since they are metered, an early bird deal may work out cheaper than the metered rate. Parking meters increasingly accept credit card payment, but have cash just in case.  Similar prices are charged in <a href="/en/Sydney/North_Sydney" title="Sydney/North Sydney">North Sydney</a>. 
</p><p><a href="/en/Sydney/City_Centre" title="Sydney/City Centre">City</a> hotels invariably charge for parking for the guests.
</p><p>Parking in many major suburban centres and beaches can be a matter of spending time cruising and searching for parking spots. Usually parking within easy walking distance of these centres has a time limit restriction - often 2-3 hours.  Shopping mall car parks usually have a similar restriction.
</p><p>Some train stations have all day free commuter parking.  At major stations, this can be full before 8AM.  Smaller stations with less frequent train service tend to have better parking availability.  On weekends it is easy to find a spot in the commuter parking lots.  The stations with commuter parking are marked on rail maps.
</p><p>Parking at some beaches, on summer weekends, can often be almost impossible.  Some beaches are in suburban neighbourhoods, without large car parking facilities.  Check the appropriate destination guides for more information.
</p><p>Parking fines in Sydney are $88 if you exceed the allowed parking time or don't pay the fee in a legitimate parking space.  Reloading the meter or moving your car within the same parking zone will not get you out of a fine.  Parking in a no stopping zone will cost you more.  If you park illegally and wait with your car, you may find you have the licence place photographed and fined before you have the chance to move on - don't expect a warning.  If you park illegally in a disabled spot, the fine is $441.  If you do get fined for exceeding time, you will not be fined again the same day.
</p><p>Clearways are no-stopping zones on main roads during peak periods, marked with clearway signs and a broken yellow line on the kerb.  Fines will be around $400 to reclaim your car after it is towed away.  Clearways also offer parking opportunities if you want to park just after 10AM.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sydney_driving_speeds">Sydney driving speeds</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sydney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41" title="Edit section: Sydney driving speeds">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>Speed limits can change frequently, even on the same main road.  Speed limits drop for areas of pedestrian activity, schools, as well as driving conditions.  Every road in Sydney has a signposted speed limit, and in every case you will need to read the signs, as you cannot tell the speed limit just by looking at the road.  The speed limit is usually 50km/h on residential streets, 60km/h to 80km/h on main roads, and sometimes higher on freeways or freeway sections.
</p><p>Some speed limits vary throughout the day.  School speed zones (40 km/h) are enforced 8AM-9:30AM and 2:30PM-4PM on school days.  Some have flashing lights, some just a sign.  It is up to you to check the time and know if it is a school day or not.   Some other roads have variable speed limits that drop during busy traffic times.  Variable speed limits also drop for road maintenance.  These areas are signposted, and you need to read and obey the signposted speed.  Speed cameras monitor school zones, and enforce variable speed limits.  For example, if there are roadworks in the Lane Cove Tunnel, the variable speed will drop, and the speed camera in the tunnel will enforce the lower speed. There are plenty of warning and reminder signs along the way.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_taxi">By taxi</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sydney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=42" title="Edit section: By taxi">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Taxis are a convenient way to get around Sydney. They can also be the only transport option available to some locations late at night when the trains and regular buses stop.
</p><p>It is usually easy enough to flag a taxi down at the kerb in the CBD, or catch one at taxi ranks located in most suburban centres.  The availability of a taxi is indicated by an illuminated "taxi" sign positioned on top of the vehicle.  If the light is on, it is available for hire; if the light is off, the cab is occupied.  You can also book a taxi by calling one of the taxi companies or booking online.
</p><p>Beware the 3PM change over and the Friday evening rush. It can be almost impossible to get a taxi 2:30PM-3:30PM. It is just as difficult 2:30AM-3:30AM, as almost all of the drivers change over their shifts at the same time. They are similarly scarce on a Friday and Saturday evenings.  Booking in advance is no guarantee, as these jobs are simply offered electronically to drivers, who may or may not accept the job.  It is easily possible to wait an hour or more for a taxi booked 24 hours in advance on a Friday and Saturday evening.  Ringing the taxi company back and complaining will often help (if the operators can relate to your problem, they have the ability to offer a taxi driver an incentive to take your fare). Cancelling your job and ringing another taxi company in frustration never helps as the taxi companies have handover systems that have seen your job handed over if another company had more capacity. You will just end up at the back of the queue again. Evenings other than Friday and Saturday are usually fine.
</p><p>During busy times, some unscrupulous drivers may try to leave the door locked and ask where you are going through the window and drive off if the destination is too close or not on their way home, even though this is illegal. If you can, get in <b>before</b> you tell them your destination - by law, they have to take you.
</p><p>There are <b>two meter rates</b>: a day rate (rate 1) with a flag fall of $3.30, a distance rate of $1.99/km, a "waiting" rate of $0.85/min, and a booking fee of $2.50; and a night rate (rate 2 - applicable to journeys commenced between 10PM-6AM), which adds a 20% surcharge to the distance rate.  You can check the rate your taxi is using by looking for a 1 or a 2 next to the current charge: if it is set to 2, it is using the night rate.  The so called "waiting" rate is charged whenever the speed drops below 25km/h.  For trips in congested traffic, it is possible for large amounts of the trip to be charged at the "waiting" rate.  All Sydney taxis are metered and taxi drivers will charge the metered rate, adding the charges for tolls manually. Silver Service taxis are more luxurious vehicles, but they are charged at the same rate as standard taxis.
</p><p>Taxis accept all major credit cards.  They charge an extra 11% on top of the fare for this. 
</p><p>Passengers are required to pay all tolls for their trip. In addition, passengers who are taken north over the Harbour Bridge, for which there is no toll, are required to pay the driver's southbound toll for the return into the city (Time of day tolling applies, and the toll varies between $2.50 and $4). Drivers will usually take the toll roads unless you ask them not to.  If you are unsure why they are asking for an amount above that shown on the meter, just ask.
</p><p>Passengers have the right to control the air conditioning and the radio so ask the driver.  Whilst most taxi drivers behave acceptably, there have been reported incidences of taxi drivers behaving inappropriately towards women: it is always safer to sit in the back of the car.
</p><p>Tipping is not required or generally expected. However, rounding up a taxi fare to the next dollar (or five or ten dollars, depending on the base fare) is fairly common.  On the other hand, if the driver rounds the fare <i>down</i> to the nearest dollar, accept with grace.
</p><p>It is very common for taxis in Sydney to overcharge tourists and people with foreign accents. Many taxi drivers observe their passengers along the way to see if they seem perceptive and alert. When they see that the passengers are relaxed or tired and not paying attention to the meter the drivers tend to overcharge about 50% by manually entering the fee into the bank card reader / EFTPOS Terminal. Always be alert when using taxis in Sydney and check the meter and the receipt if possible. It is best to pay taxis in cash to avoid this from happening. However, when overcharging does occur the best way to resolve these situations is simply to tell the driver assertively that either they give you back the overcharged amount in cash or you will call the police. 
</p><p><b>Uber</b> is also available throughout most areas of Sydney, and are generally (beware of surge pricing!) cheaper and provide a better level of service - they have to maintain at least a 4 star rating or they can no longer drive.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_bike">By bike</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sydney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=43" title="Edit section: By bike">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>If you are a fit and experienced urban cyclist, used to riding on multi-lane roads in heavy traffic, then just get on your bike.  Cyclists are permitted just about everywhere on Sydney's roads, except for of some freeway tunnels where bicycle signs will usually direct you to the alternative route.  Kerbside lanes are often narrow, so ride assertively, be seen, and take the full lane when you know there is insufficient room to be passed. Bikes are permitted in bus lanes (like the city streets), but not bus only lanes (like the harbour bridge, and T-ways).  
</p><p>The <a href="/en/Sydney/City" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">city centre</a> is not particularly cyclist friendly traffic-wise. It is not flat either - you can expect regular hills but no marathon uphill climbs. The weather is, however, usually good for cycling.
</p><p>If you are looking for a quieter ride, a number of quiet on-road and shared pedestrian/cycle paths are available, but can be hard to find. A good place to start is at <a href="/en/Sydney/Sydney_Olympic_Park" title="Sydney/Sydney Olympic Park">Sydney Olympic Park</a> where you can get your cycle legs on the extensive off-road trails; then, if you want to, you can follow off-road/quiet road trails out to <a href="/en/Sydney/Parramatta" title="Sydney/Parramatta">Parramatta</a> or following the Cooks River to Botany Bay in <a href="/en/Sydney/Southern_Sydney" title="Sydney/Southern Sydney">Southern Sydney</a>.  The Harbour Bridge has a dedicated cycle lane, suitable for all ages, but as soon as you get off the bridge you are back onto urban streets in <a href="/en/Sydney/North_Sydney" title="Sydney/North Sydney">Milsons Point</a>.
</p><p>The Bourke St cycleway is a newly opened north-south route in the the City East and a cruisy place to cycle between Woolloomooloo, Darlinghurst and Surry Hills.   Lots of shade and cafes to break the trip. Some other separated cycleways have opened in the City centre, but they are yet to form a cohesive network, and your trip may easily end up on a busy and unforgiving city road if you haven't planned well in advance.
</p><p>Other cycleways are often just converted footpaths, so be on the lookout for bollards, street signs, roots and branches strategically placed across cycle paths - as well as pedestrians. If cycling at night ensure you have lights bright enough to light your path.
</p><p>It is illegal to ride bicycles on footpaths unless cycling with children under 12. In reality this is fairly weakly enforced out in the suburbs, but it is common for people to be fined for cycling through pedestrian malls in the city like Pitt St Mall or Martin Place.  Out in the suburbs you can often follow quiet streets, and hop onto the footpath for a short stretch if things get too hairy.  Bicycle helmets are required by law, as are lights and reflectors at night. 
</p><p>Bicycles can be taken on all Sydney Trains, but a child fare should be paid if any part of the journey is made before 9AM or after 3:30PM on weekdays.  In the city centre during the evening peak you will be lucky to fit your bike onto a train. Check trackwork schedules on weekends <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sydneytrains.info/trackwork/">[14]</a>, when buses replace trains and make taking bicycles more challenging.
</p><p>Bike hire is available in many locations in Sydney.  Unfortunately, bike hire for two bikes for a day usually costs more than hiring a small car and petrol for the day (around $50 per bike).  However, for shorter periods some places may be reasonably priced (for example <a href="/en/Sydney/Sydney_Olympic_Park" title="Sydney/Sydney Olympic Park">Sydney Olympic Park</a>) charges $15 per hour.  Also, you have to consider the additional cost if the bikes are stolen or damaged.  However, they are much easier to park, are greener and can be more fun.  See the <a href="/en/Sydney#districts" title="Sydney">district articles</a> for bike hire listings.
</p><p>If you just want to have a ride, most bicycle user groups around Sydney organise weekend rides for various levels of fitness.  There is usually no charge to join in.

<p>Sydney is one of those cities that invites tourists to custom-design their sightseeing. Unlike many cities throughout the world, Sydney is not a city where people come to see "X" or experience "Y." That's because Sydney is home to museums, cafes and restaurants, shopping and historical sites. It can be explored both on foot and via the water. While all of Sydney has sights worth visiting, much of its glory is housed in the City Centre. Here, visitors can choose to start their visit with a journey back in time at <a href="/en/The_Rocks" class="mw-redirect" title="The Rocks">The Rocks</a>, site of the first European settlement in Australia. 
</p><p>If you want to learn more about Australia's past, present and future, you can visit the multitude of museums found in City Centre. Some museums are free to enter year-round while others charge admission.
</p><p>The Sydney Harbour Bridge and <b>Sydney Opera House</b> are two of Sydney's famous landmarks that can be visited when exploring Sydney on foot. While these are two of the best-known landmarks, Sydney's City Centre has a host of less famous buildings and structures that are worth a visit.
</p><p>Australia is nothing if not renowned for its vast and unique variety of wildlife. There are numerous opportunities to spot birds, bats, opossums and the occasional kangaroo or wallaby in Sydney's national parks. The only trick is that most of these animals are primarily spotted at sunrise and sunset when the weather is coolest. Those wishing to guarantee animal sightings can head to the <b>Taronga Zoo</b> in the Lower North Shore or the <b>Wild Life Sydney Zoo</b> in Darling Harbour. Darling Harbour is also home to the <b>Sea Life Sydney Aquarium</b>. The aquarium offers visitors an opportunity to truly see life "down under", down under the water anyway.
</p><p>For a different type of animal sighting, visitors can head to Sydney's Eastern Suburbs to find the famous <b>Bondi Beach</b>. This beach attracts thousands of visitors every year, making it a great place for people watching.
</p><p>After exploring Sydney by land, stop by <b>Sydney Harbour</b> to explore it by water. Ferries, cruises and whale watching excursions depart regularly from this part of Sydney.

<p>Sydney's large natural harbour was the reason that the original penal settlement was established in the area, near what is now known as Circular Quay.  It is now well developed, with skyscrapers, highrises, and houses all around its shores, but it is still very beautiful.
</p><p>The harbour is served by <b>ferry</b> services that transport passengers around the harbour. An excellent way to see both the harbour and Sydney attractions is to take a ferry east from <a href="/en/Sydney/City#See" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">Circular Quay</a> to Taronga Zoo or <a href="/en/Sydney/Manly" title="Sydney/Manly">Manly</a> or west under the Harbour Bridge towards <a href="/en/Sydney/Parramatta" title="Sydney/Parramatta">Parramatta</a>. These are reasonably priced and a favourite for tourists. If time is short, for a shorter route, the ferry between Circular Quay and Darling Harbour will let you ride under the Harbour Bridge and see the central part of the harbour.
</p><p>Catch a <b>ferry</b> from <b>Circular Quay</b> to <a href="/en/Sydney/Manly" title="Sydney/Manly">Manly</a>. Before returning to the Sydney CBD, walk from the Manly ferry wharf along the <b>Manly Corso</b> to famous <b>Manly Beach</b>. A great day, afternoon or evening out at a fraction of the price of a commercial harbour cruise.
</p><p>You can take a <b>cruise</b> on Sydney Harbour.  There are many cruises to choose from and they depart from <a href="/en/Sydney/Darling_Harbour#Harbour_cruises" title="Sydney/Darling Harbour">Darling Harbour</a> or <a href="/en/Sydney/City#Harbour_cruises" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">Circular Quay</a>. If an intimate cruise is more to your taste, there are a number of quality private boat charter <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://sydneycharterboat.com.au/boats/">[19]</a> options available for hire on Sydney Harbour. For a bigger adrenalin rush, try the jet boats that zip around the harbour <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.sydneyjet.com.au/">[20]</a> at breakneck speeds.
</p><p>Sydney Harbour can be viewed from the <a href="/en/Sydney/City" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">city</a> or from on of the many walks next to it, most of which are easily accessible by ferry or bus.
</p><p>The world famous <b>Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race</b> begins every year on Boxing Day, on Sydney Harbour. Thousands of spectator craft take to the water to farewell the yachts as they set off on their grueling journey to Hobart. Seaworthy craft can follow the yachts through the Sydney Heads into the open ocean.  You can also see the race from a harbour vantage point like Watsons Bay. where you can see them sail towards you across the harbour, and then cross to the gap to see them sail down the coast.
</p><p>You can visit the <a href="/en/Sydney/Harbour_Islands" title="Sydney/Harbour Islands">Harbour Islands</a> by ferry or water taxi.
</p><p>Swing by the <b>Royal Botanic Gardens</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/">[21]</a> and the <b>Art Gallery of New South Wales</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/">[22]</a> on the edge of the gardens. While you're in the area visit <b>Mrs Macquarie's Chair</b> for a picture postcard view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House in one picture. You may have to compete with the numerous wedding couples on weekends.

<ul><li>If you've got the time and inclination, Sydney offers decent fishing during the warmer months. It's not recommended to fish in Sydney Harbour due to pollution. Do NOT eat fish caught in the harbour, it has been found Sydney Harbour fish are tainted with dioxin which is harmful to humans. However signing up with a fishing charter to take you out of the Harbour into open water, Middle Harbour or Pittwater is a rewarding experience. You'll likely catch something of decent size and even if you don't, being out on a boat in Sydney is one of the great Sydney experiences in the warmer months (if you can afford it).</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Winter:</b> The winter football season generally begins with trial matches in February, before the season proper kicks off in March and runs to late September or early October. Sydney's most popular winter football code is <b>rugby league</b> (often just called 'football' or 'footy' by locals - although never just 'rugby', which refers to rugby union). Nine teams from the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.nrl.com">national competition</a> are based in Sydney and the sport is an important part of the city's culture - many teams play at least some of their games at intimate grounds in their suburban heartlands, and this can be a good way to experience the traditional heart of the sport. There are also State of Origin games, where the best of New South Wales and Queensland players are matched against each other. This is significantly rougher. Other major sporting teams playing in Sydney over the winter are the Sydney Swans and Greater Western Sydney Giants (AFL), the NSW Waratahs (rugby union) and the Sydney Swifts (Netball).</li>
<li><b>Summer:</b> Sydney's primary summer sport is <b>cricket</b>, which you'll find being played (in somewhat modified form) on beaches and in backyards across the city. The professional stuff is largely based at the Sydney Cricket Ground close to the CBD: the traditional New Year's Test, between the Australian team and whichever foreign team is touring at the time, commences around the 3rd of January and runs for four to five days. Later in the summer, international one-day and/or Twenty20 matches are held at the SCG.</li></ul>
<p>The primary domestic tournaments, contested between Australian state teams, are the Sheffield Shield (first-class), Ford Ranger Cup (one-day) and KFC Big Bash (Twenty20): they are usually sparsely attended and so are much cheaper to attend than internationals. Some one-day and Twenty20 matches are played at ANZ Stadium at Olympic Park rather than at the SCG, but the cavernous stadium is far inferior to the grand old ground if you really want to get a feel for cricket culture. Australia's professional Association Football tournament, the A-League, runs over the summer.  Sydney has 2 teams; Sydney FC, who play at the Sydney Football Stadium and Western Sydney Wanderers who play at Parramatta stadium.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Walk">Walk</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sydney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=60" title="Edit section: Walk">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Sydney has a huge amount of green space, much of it beside the sparkling harbour or ocean, so walking is a great way to experience the city's parks, reserves and remnant bushland. There are also great walks through the more built-up areas, allowing you to check out the city's modern architecture and its colonial heritage. The following are just a few of the better-known routes.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Across the Harbour Bridge</b> from <a href="/en/Sydney/The_Rocks" title="Sydney/The Rocks">The Rocks</a> on the south side to Milsons Point on the north side (or vice versa).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Coogee Beach to Bondi</b>. Following the eastern coastline past several of Sydney's beautiful beaches - stop off for a swim if you get too hot.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Manly to the Spit</b>. Along the foreshore of Sydney Harbour <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.manlyweb.com.au/information/what_to_do/walks/walkway.asp">[25]</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bradleys Head</b>. Take a ferry to Taronga Zoo wharf and then head to your right along the promontory. There's pristine bushland (almost unchanged from the time of European colonisation), quiet beaches, and knockout views across the harbour, and in the warmer months you'll spot plenty of Eastern Water Dragons, a type of large lizard. Once you reach the tip of the headland, you can either amble back to the wharf or - if you're feeling more ambitious - follow the track several more kilometres to Clifton Gardens, ogling the gigantic houses along the way. From there, you can either hike all the way back to Taronga or get a bus to a ferry wharf.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Circular Quay and surrounds</b>. Start underneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge, then walk past <a href="/en/Sydney/The_Rocks" title="Sydney/The Rocks">The Rocks</a>, Circular Quay, the Sydney Opera House, the <b>Royal Botanic Gardens</b> and <b>Mrs Macquarie's Chair</b>. For an extended tour of the city centre, covering these and other major sights, see <a href="/en/Walking_tour_of_Sydney" title="Walking tour of Sydney">Walking tour of Sydney</a>.</li>
<li><b>The Colony Walk</b>. The way of the earliest European colonists.</li></ul>

<p>Sydney has four indoor ice skating centres in the suburbs.  The closest to the city centre is:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Macquarie Ice Rink</b>. Macquarie Ice Rink is in the vast expanse of Macquarie Shopping Centre in North Ryde. Activities include training sessions, birthday parties and casual visits. Skates are available for hire (usually a bit worn and not necessarily sharp), or bring your own. Phone to enquire about public session times as the ice is shared between many other users (like hockey teams) and may not be available for the whole day. It is located within a 2 minute walk from Macquarie University railway station.</li></ul>
<p>But there are three others; one near Canterbury station, one west of Liverpool and one next to Norwest in North West Sydney.

<p>Sydney has three theatres which show major international productions, the Capitol Theatre in <a href="/en/Sydney/City_South" title="Sydney/City South">Haymarket</a>, the Theatre Royal under the MLC Centre in the <a href="/en/Sydney/City" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/City">CBD</a> and the Lyric Theatre in Star City in <a href="/en/Sydney/City_West#Do" title="Sydney/City West">Pyrmont Bay</a>.  Usually one of the latest theatre blockbusters will be on show at these theatres. The State Theatre on Market Street has been the host of the Sydney Film Festival since 1974. Slightly more on the cutting edge, with more locally produced drama can be found at the Sydney Theatre Company, in Walsh Bay in <a href="/en/Sydney/The_Rocks" title="Sydney/The Rocks">The Rocks</a>, or occasionally at the Opera House Drama Theatre.  Similar productions are often on at the Seymour Centre next to Sydney University just off Broadway on City Road. Smaller theatres, some with lesser known performers, featuring new and local writers can be harder to find.  Try the Belvoir St Theatre in Surry Hills in City East, or the Newtown Theatre in the <a href="/en/Sydney/Inner_West" title="Sydney/Inner West">Inner West</a>. Amateur theatre, especially musical theatre, proliferates in Sydney, with over 30 amateur musical theatre companies providing a fun night of theatre for around $20 per ticket in the suburbs.  Check the Riverside Theatre in <a href="/en/Sydney/Parramatta" title="Sydney/Parramatta">Parramatta</a>, the Zenith Theatre in Chatswood on the <a href="/en/Sydney/Lower_North_Shore" title="Sydney/Lower North Shore">Lower North Shore</a>, or the Sutherland Entertainment Centre in <a href="/en/Sydney/Sutherland_Shire" title="Sydney/Sutherland Shire">Sutherland</a>.

<p>As with the rest of Australia, currency exchange offices operate in a free market, and the small convenient exchange booth you pass on George Street, by the Opera House or at the airport can charge 15% or more over the best rate you can obtain elsewhere.  As always, check rates and commission carefully.  Know today's rate and be prepared to walk away if the amount of money they calculate isn't what you would expect.  Banks typically offer much better rates, but are only open business hours on weekdays.

<p>Those quintessential Aussie souvenirs - stuffed koalas and kangaroos, various "Australiana" knick-knacks - can be found in any souvenir store around the city, as well as in airport shops.

<p>Australia's unique style and creativity means Sydney is developing on the international fashion circuit, as designs from Australians such as Wayne Cooper, Collette Dinnigan, Akira Isogawa, Lisa Ho, Oroton and Easton Pearson are seen around the globe. In fact, around 60 Australian labels are currently exporting their designs to boutiques and department stores in <a href="/en/Asia" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="/en/United_States" class="mw-redirect" title="United States">United States</a>.

<p>Prices are inflated in convenience stores and in tourist areas, and it is worth seeking out the supermarkets - even in the city centre.  Overcharging tourists and people with foreign accents is common in convenience stores. It is best to keep an eye on the clerks especially in touristic areas and check the receipts and amounts charged. The main <b>Supermarket Chains</b> in Sydney are Woolworths <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.woolworths.com.au">[36]</a>, Coles <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.coles.com.au">[37]</a>, IGA Australia <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.iga.com.au">[38]</a> and Aldi <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aldi.com.au">[39]</a>.

<p>Sydney postcards are least expensive at post offices (AUD 0.75), where you can buy stamps from as well. Do look in Paddy's Markets.

<p>Prices in Sydney's restaurants vary. Breakfast at a standard cafe (food plus a coffee or juice) can cost anywhere up to $20 for a full English breakfast or other substantial meal. A main meal in a mid-range restaurant is around $25-35. Upper mid-range averages around $35-45. At the real top-end places a dinner for two with wine can run up to $400-500 and beyond.
</p><p>For the more budget-conscious, Sydney's multicultural demography means plenty of quality ethnic cuisine for cheap prices, particular Asian restaurants. Many restaurants particularly in the city will also offer "lunch specials". For example, a good Korean "set lunch" can be found for less than $15. A bowl of noodles in Chinatown will run you $8 or $9. Some Thai curry with rice at any of the many restaurants all over Sydney will cost about $10.
</p><p>Newtown in Sydney's inner-west (approx 4km from the CBD) is renowned for its inexpensive cafes and restaurants on King St, in particular Thai food. It is highly popular among students from the nearby Sydney University.
</p><p>For an Asian bent, head to Chinatown for authentic Asian cheap eats. As well as restaurants, there are numerous food courts scattered throughout Chinatown packed with Asian eateries where the rock bottom priced food (but no less tasty) can be found. Plonk down at a laminate table shoulder to shoulder with hungry locals for some bubble tea and a sizzing plate of delicious Asian food. If you have a little money to spend, yum cha (dim sum) for lunch at one of the many Cantonese restaurants around Sydney is a regular ritual for many Sydney siders. Yum cha can be had in Chinatown (avoid the touristy al fresco places on Dixon St, go to East Ocean or Marigold instead), the city (Zilver, Sky Phoenix and others) and most urban centres around Sydney. Expect queues on weekends and brusque service all days - it's all part of the charm of yum cha.  Some yum cha restaurants have now abandoned the trolleys, and instead give you a menu to tick your items which will be brought to your table.  Some only have trolleys for specials or on weekends.

<p>Just about every suburb in Sydney has a restaurant or two, a cafe or coffee shop, and a place that sells takeaway food.
</p><p>However, there are are a number of places in Sydney where you can window shop through many restaurants and make your choice. 
</p><p>All of <a href="/en/Sydney/Darling_Harbour" title="Sydney/Darling Harbour">Darling Harbour</a> is like this, there are restaurants of every variety all along the waterfront. East Circular Quay in the <a href="/en/Sydney/City_Centre" title="Sydney/City Centre">City Centre</a> is similar, along with the International Passenger Terminal on the west of Circular Quay - however many of the restaurants in this area are expensive and loved more for the view than the quality of the food. There are (pricey) exceptions, such as Cafe Sydney, Aria and Sailors Thai.
</p><p>Circular Quay / the Rocks has many pubs to choose from which serve meals. The Australian Hotel serves local specialities such as crocodile pizza. 
</p><p>In the <a href="/en/Sydney/City_East" title="Sydney/City East">east of the city</a>, Victoria Street in Darlinghurst and Crown Street in Surry Hills (between Oxford and Cleveland Streets) has a large range of funky cafes, small bars, pubs, patisseries and restaurants. Darlinghurst and Surry Hills has it all, from cheap Asian take-aways to high-end restaurants. Many trendy restaurants in this area don't take bookings; often you wait at the bar for a table. These suburbs are popular with hipsters, yuppies and the gay community.
</p><p>Just east of the city is Woolloomooloo Wharf which boasts a fantastic view across the harbour and several upmarket restaurants, including excellent steak, Chinese, Italian and seafood restaurants. Perfect for lunch on a sunny day.
</p><p><a href="/en/Sydney/Inner_West#Newtown" title="Sydney/Inner West">King Street, Newtown</a>, centred on the railway station, has a constantly changing selection of good value restaurants, pubs, cafes and bars. You can find many various types of cuisine here; mainly cheap Thai, but also Vietnamese, Italian, Turkish, Japanese and modern Australian. This area isn't touristy, but popular with students from the nearby Sydney University. The area has its own alternative style, which makes for great people watching.
</p><p>On the <a href="/en/Sydney/Lower_North_Shore#Eat" title="Sydney/Lower North Shore">Lower North Shore</a> Willoughby Road at Crows Nest, has honest and consistently good Indian, Japanese, Thai, steak, a handful of small bars. Military Road through Cremorne and Neutral Bay have a smattering of decent restaurants, mostly Japanese. Kirribilli has a few nice cafes and restaurants, and a short after dinner stroll will take you by some of the best views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
</p><p>Within <a href="/en/Sydney/Inner_West#Leichardt" title="Sydney/Inner West">Norton Street, Leichardt</a>, there are plenty of restaurants and cafes for dining out. Check out Norton Street for classic Italian, and explore surrounding suburbs of Annandale and Glebe for amazing brunch locations.
</p><p><a href="/en/Sydney/Parramatta#Eat" title="Sydney/Parramatta">Parramatta</a>, to the west, has an eating strip, many with alfresco options. Harris Park nearby is Sydney's Little India with a good number of very affordable, authentic Indian restaurants.

</p><p>The best cafes are usually in the inner city and the inner west. Many Sydneysiders take great joy in good coffee, and the very best places for this will be the likes of Campos Coffee on Missenden Road in Newtown, Coffee Alchemy in Marrickville, Mecca Espresso in Ultimo or King Street in the City, Single Origin Roasters near Elizabeth St in Surry Hills, or The Source Espresso Bar in Mosman. Other well-known favourites include Three Blue Ducks in Bronte (also open for dinner and run by ex-head chef of Michelin starred Tetsuya's), Bourke Street Bakery in Surry Hills (where a very good bakery is crammed into a tiny corner terrace), and Black Star Pastry in Newtown. You can expect to line up for any of these, though the wait is worth it.
</p><p>Sydney's strong cafe culture is matched by its penchant for morning and all-day breakfasts. A visit to Sydney is not complete without having breakfast at one of the many beach-side cafes in the Eastern Beaches (Coogee and Bronte in particular; in Bondi you will find the better cafes along Bondi Rd heading down to the beach or in the streets back from Campbell Parade), the Northern Beaches (Manly in particular, but also Freshwater or Dee Why) and at Cronulla, in the city's south. If you do get to a beachside cafe for breakfast, a quintessential Australian breakfast is Corn Fritters with Bacon and Poached Eggs.

<p>Thanks to Sydney's (or rather, Australia's) multicultural mix, "modern Australian" is usually characterised by a fusion of cuisines. Think entrées spiced with a Thai-inspired chilli dressing, mains with a hint of a Chinese-style ginger-based marinade or sunny Tuscan flavours- all in the same menu. Many of Australia's celebrity chefs are of ethnic backgrounds, and many have trained overseas, bringing with them a world of experience back home.
</p>
<ul><li>Visit the <b>Sydney Fish Markets</b> in Pyrmont (within walking distance of <a href="/en/Sydney/Darling_Harbour" title="Sydney/Darling Harbour">Darling Harbour</a>) for a lunch of fresh seafood of almost any description. Sadly the cooked seafood on offer is overpriced, greasy and frankly an embarrassment. Avoid. For a proper seafood lunch at the fish markets, bypass these shops and go directly to one of the many fishmongers. Pick out the best freshly shucked oysters, cooked Balmain Bug or lobster tails, glistening prawns and  sashimi. Take it out to tables outside and enjoy getting your hands dirty. Otherwise, head upstairs to Fisherman's Wharf Chinese Restaurant for some wonderful Cantonese seafood or yum cha.</li>
<li>Hit a <b>steakhouse</b> and try Australia's world-famous prime Angus beef.</li></ul>
<p>Alternatively, many CBD pubs offer $6 to $10 steak "meal deals", provided that you also order a particular alcoholic drink at the same time.

<p>For those who are after authentic multicultural culinary experiences, there are unique "food districts" scattered around the greater city. The range of food available is huge and isn't necessarily expensive.  It is usually possible to find a restaurant of any nationality, specialising in almost any cuisine.
</p>
<ul><li>Eat <b>Chinese</b> (Cantonese) in <a href="/en/Sydney/City_South" title="Sydney/City South">Chinatown</a> Chatswood on the <a href="/en/Sydney/Lower_North_Shore" title="Sydney/Lower North Shore">North Shore</a>. "Noodle markets" are also held in Chinatown every Friday, starting from around 17:30. Many Chinatown restaurants hold open-air stalls, selling everything from finger food, to stir-fry noodles, to Chinese-style desserts. For more northern Chinese flavours, including Shanghainese and Pekingnese, head to Ashfield and Strathfield in the <a href="/en/Sydney/Inner_West" title="Sydney/Inner West">Sydney/Inner West</a>- both easily accessible via public transport. Some outer suburbs are particularly known for their Chinese restaurants - recommended examples are Eastwood (north-west), Parramatta (west) and Hurstville in Sydney's <a href="/en/Sydney/Southern_Sydney" title="Sydney/Southern Sydney">southern suburbs</a> which all have a number of restaurants offering more home-style Chinese food. They are all accessible by public transport.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Uyghur</b> on Dixon Street, Haymarket (Chinatown)- fiery, flavour-bursting food originating from the Turkic regions of Central Asia.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Thai</b> in one of the many low priced Thai outlets in Newtown's King Street in the <a href="/en/Sydney/Inner_West" title="Sydney/Inner West">Inner West</a>, or around "Thaitown" in the city (around Campbell St, near Chinatown).</li>
<li>Eat <b>Italian</b> in one of the restaurants in Leichhardt's Norton Street, or nearby Ramsay Street, Haberfield in the <a href="/en/Sydney/Inner_West" title="Sydney/Inner West">Inner West</a>. Or in Stanley St in East Sydney - a walk from the CBD.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Spanish</b> in Liverpool Street in the city.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Portuguese</b> in Petersham in the Inner West.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Brazilian</b> at La Favela, Bondi.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Indian</b> in one of the many restaurants in the <a href="/en/Sydney/Outer_West" title="Sydney/Outer West">Outer West</a> with all types of Indian cuisine (North Indian, South Indian, Vegetarian, meat, etc.)</li>
<li>Eat <b>Korean</b> in Liverpool &amp; Pitt St in City, Strathfield, Eastwood and Campsie.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Japanese</b> in Neutral Bay or Crows Nest.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Nepalese</b> in Glebe Point Road, Glebe, in the Inner West or Crows Nest.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Turkish</b> in Auburn (Outer West). Closer to the city, there try Enmore Rd Enmore / South King St Newtown in the Inner West. Get your Sucuklu and Pastirmali here.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Lebanese</b> in Cleveland Street. Baba Ghanouj, Lahem Begin and Baclawa here. Salam Alaikum. For the very best Lebanese, head out to the Middle Eastern enclaves of Greenacre or Lakemba.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Vietnamese</b> in Marrickville. The most authentic Vietnamese can be experienced in <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sydney/South_Weat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sydney/South Weat (page does not exist)">Cabramatta</a> or Bankstown. If you have the time, Cabramatta particularly is a fascinating and worthwhile day trip. So awash is the suburb with Vietnamese restaurants groceries, butchers, craft shops, clothing stores and restaurants - not to mention Vietnamese people - you'd swear you were walking around Saigon rather than Sydney.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Kosher</b> in <a href="/en/Sydney/Bondi" class="mw-redirect" title="Sydney/Bondi">Bondi</a>. Many great restaurants throughout the area.</li>
<li>Eat <b>Indonesian</b> in Anzac Parade, Kensington, Kingsford &amp; Maroubra.</li></ul>

<p>Take away food in Sydney can be as cheap as buying the ingredients and making it yourself, and many stores specialise in take-away food. There will usually be a picnic table, park or beach nearby to eat whatever you can select. Quintessential Aussie takeaways include the meat pie (minced beef with gravy sauce in a crusty pastry shell), sausage roll (sausage mince in a puff pastry casing), usually topped generously with tomato sauce/ketchup, and fish and chips (inherited from the British to be sure but loved by all Australians).
</p><p>Most restaurants will do take-away food as well, but almost certainly at a premium to the cost of buying food from a take-away.  Outside of the city an occasional restaurant may offer a 10% discount for take-away.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vegetarian_and_special_diets">Vegetarian and special diets</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Sydney&amp;action=edit&amp;section=95" title="Edit section: Vegetarian and special diets">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Vegetarians are well catered for.  Every restaurant will usually have at least one vegetarian dish. Indian restaurants can be relied upon to provide a wider selection. The trendy <a href="/en/Sydney/City_East" title="Sydney/City East">East Sydney</a> and <a href="/en/Sydney/Inner_West" title="Sydney/Inner West">Inner West</a> suburbs have many choices, Cabramatta in the western suburbs have many Asian Buddhist cuisine restaurants that are vegan and vegetarian.
</p><p>There is an awareness of gluten-free and dairy-free diets in Sydney, and again the more trendier inner city suburbs are more likely to cater for these diets.

<p>It seems every weekend, there is a food festival on in one of the suburbs of Sydney.  Usually the idea is that restaurants take part, providing smaller portions of their signature dishes around $7-$12 a plate.
</p><p>The largest food festival, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.siff.com.au/">Sydney International Food Festival</a>, which showcases Sydney's food culture is in October, which includes the night noodle markets operating in Hyde Park in the <a href="/en/Sydney/City_Centre" title="Sydney/City Centre">City Centre</a>

<p>The general rule on <a href="/en/Australia#Tipping" title="Australia">tipping in Australia</a> is that it is not compulsory and generally not expected.  This remains true for most cafes, and for counter service in Sydney.  However for a full service restaurant in a tourist areas and mid to higher end restaurants a tip would be expected by the waitstaff. However, most Australians will still not tip, and you should feel free to follow their lead should you wish to.  Some snootier waiters may raise an eyebrow, but nobody will follow you or give you a hard time.  Otherwise a 10% tip added to the bill or rounding the bill up to the nearest $10, $20 or $50 to a maximum of 10% (depending on the size of the bill!) will usually meet their expectations.  They may be expecting a little more if you have an American accent, as they are well aware of what Americans tip at home.
</p><p>The national minimum wage in Australia (as at July 2022) is $21.38 an hour, so unlike their counterparts in some other countries, Australian hospitality workers do not rely on tips to survive.

<p>Australians are casual. While most people make an effort to dress up for fancier restaurants, there is no requirement and both restaurants and diners alike are relaxed about dress standards. There are no restaurants in Sydney that require jackets for men for instance, and jeans (nice - no holes) are common in even the most expensive and posh Sydney restaurants. Wear what you feel comfortable in.

<p>Sydney has an enormous number of places to drink and party. A limited number of venues have 24-hour licenses, however the majority close before 3AM and some as early as 11PM, particularly if there are nearby residents.
</p><p>New liquor laws covering most of the Central Sydney area (including Kings Cross, The Rocks and parts of Darlinghurst and Surry Hills) came into force in February 2014. There is a 'lockout' between 1:30am and 5am, which means that you need to stay inside the pub/bar/club or you won't be able to get back in - even if you go out for a cigarette (smoking is illegal inside). No alcohol can be served between 3am and 5am. As a result of the laws, some bars will now close at 1am if they are not many patrons. Ask the bouncers or some locals if you're unsure and they will tell you which places are affected by the lockout and which aren't.
</p><p>Busy venues will have door staff checking photo identification to determine that you are over 18. Admission is also commonly refused to those who seem visibly drunk. More popular venues have discriminatory door practices, the most common of which is refusing entry to groups of men who are not accompanied by women.  Some pubs and most clubs will admit children accompanied by adults as long as they don't approach the bar or enter an area where there is gambling.  Check with staff at the venue.  Some pubs don't provide a nice environment for children some nights. Photo identification proving that you are 18 or older will often be required again when purchasing alcohol if you appear to be under 25. Generally only Australian driver licences and Australian or foreign passports will be accepted.
</p><p>In recent years after the lock-out laws came into effect, other regulations have been increased substantially making it harder for clubs and bars to survive. As a result, the majority of well known quality clubs in Sydney have had to close shop. Unwarranted police raids into bars and harassment of people is common. Both strategies have been used by the state government for years to effectively kill the city's nightlife.
</p><p>Many places have at least a basic dress code, enforced all hours in the city, and usually after 7pm in the suburbs. For most generic pubs, men should wear closed toe shoes (not running sneakers), full-length pants, and a shirt with sleeves (not a singlet). For clubs, men should don neat business-style shoes.  In almost all cases, women can dress more freely, but a small number of places require closed shoes or dressy sandals or high heels.
</p><p>Many pubs are called hotels, but only very few can ever offer you a place to sleep. Hotel pubs are usually found on a street corner with at least one ground-floor bar, and are usually a few floors high (though not all floors may be open to the public).
</p><p>Entry charges for live music or DJs are usual and range from $5 to $30 depending on clientèle. Entry charges are rare if you're going into a pub for a drink.
</p><p>There is a taxi shift change at 3AM, and it is notoriously difficult to catch a taxi anywhere between 2:30AM and 3:30AM.

There are many great bars and pubs on Broadway, such as the Lansdowne Hotel which also offers cheap lunch meals for $5-6 on some days of the week.

<p>The state government made changes to liquor licensing laws in previous years, which has seen an explosion in the number of small bars throughout the greater city. The sheer number of them mean there will always be a new latest and trendiest bar to go to - for the most up to date ones, check out the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/">TimeOut Sydney</a> website. Most of them are well hidden in office building basements, or in laneways, or frequently both, and the only way you'll find them is by seeing the queue to get in. Be wary though: on Friday and Saturday nights these places will more than likely be packed out. For the best experience, head along on a weeknight. After-work crowds will mean there is some life to the place, but you won't have to wait in a queue just to get in.
</p><p>A great example of the quality of these types of establishments is <b>Baxter Inn</b>, off Clarence Street in the city, which was voted the #8 bar in the world in 2013, by Drinks International. 
</p><p>A good majority of these small bars also have a theme to them, such as <b>Vasco</b> on Cleveland St (a very fun Rock and Roll bar), <b>Tio's</b> (Guatemalan Owl Cerveceria), <b>Lobo Plantation</b> (colonial plantation, minus the racism), and <b>The Barbershop</b> (Barbershop-cum-bar, and you can actually get your hair cut). Other heavyweights in the small bar league include <b>Shady Pines Saloon</b> in Darlinghurst, <b>121 BC</b> in Surry Hills, <b>Mary's</b> in Newtown, <b>Bulletin Place</b> in the City, and <b>Frankie's Pizza</b> also in the City. Many of the more established small bars are in the CBD and inner-city, mostly Darlinghurst and Surry Hills. Don't be shy about visiting some of the more up-and-coming suburbs, either. Marrickville and Redfern are rapidly gentrifying, and with it, a slew of very interesting bars are popping up along their main commercial strips. In Manly, on the Northern Beaches, and throughout Mosman and Cremorne on the Lower North Shore there is a cluster of very formidable and popular bars.

<p>Sydney's gay scene is concentrated on Oxford Street in <a href="/en/Sydney/City_East#Drink" title="Sydney/City East">City East</a> although it still has a large range of pubs and clubs for both LGBT and straight partiers and is a prominent nightspot for many party-goers. Sydney's queer community also can often be found on King Street in Newtown which offers a more relaxed place to gather and far fewer yobs. Generally speaking, King Street, Newtown is more popular with Lesbians while Oxford Street is much more popular Gay Men. You can expect Drag shows in just about any of Oxford Street's gay bars. Stonewall Hotel has these on the hour on busier nights, while Thursday nights at Arq have an amateur "Drag for Dollars" event. <b>The Imperial</b> in Erskineville is also worth checking out for its shows, though is a little bit off the beaten track - but still only a short stroll from Erskineville or Newtown station.

<p>Sydney's microbreweries are in the Rocks and the City Centre. Noteworthy mentions around here include the King St Brewhouse at King Street Wharf, and the Lord Nelson on Kent St in The Rocks.

Problems are typically caused by young, aggressive, drunk males, with most problems occurring after midnight in hotspots such as King's Cross and the CBD. Some attacks are random and unprovoked, even causing death in some instances where the victim has been caught off-guard by a "king hit", fallen and hit their head on the pavement.
</p><p>However, the occurrence of such incidents have been greatly exaggerated in the media in recent years to promote and justify the state government's "lock out" laws agenda. The statistics backing up these claims have been disputed. Sydney is a safe city and the likelihood of something happening to you is very small. Due to the increased occurrences of such incidents in recent years, police presence has also been markedly scaled up in problem areas. However it is worth exercising caution while out drinking late anywhere in Sydney. Avoid large groups of rowdy, obviously drunk men. If you are provoked, walk away. If the things escalate call the police immediately on 000.

Sydney has hundreds of accommodation options in Central Sydney to consider, from backpackers hotels to five star hotels with harbour and Opera House views. There are also options out of the city centre too.
</p><p>If you are travelling on business, there may be business style accommodation near to where you are working, and there is usually no need to stay in the city.  There are options around the commercial areas at the airport in Southern Sydney, around Macquarie Park in the North West, and at Parramatta.  
</p><p>If you are travelling with a car, then finding a place to park, and getting into and out of the city can be a hassle.  The Hume Highway in Sydney's South West has the standard roadside motels where you can park by your room, with the service station or fast food outlet next door.
</p><p>If you are into camping, the closest camping to the city centre is on the Cockatoo Island in the harbour.  You can pitch a tent in Lane Cove National Park, less than 10km from the city centre, and around 750m from the closest train station.
</p><p>If you are into the beach, the Manly and Bondi are the two obvious places to consider.  From Manly 25 minutes on the ferry has you right in the centre of Sydney.  Some of the lesser known suburbs have accommodation options.  Cronulla has beachfront accommodation, facilities and is the only beachside suburb of Sydney with a train station (45 minutes from downtown).

<p>Be on the lookout for the usual big city petty crime problems, though pickpocketing and theft is much less common then in cities in Europe or Asia.  Lock your car, and keep valuables safe or hidden.  People begging may ask for money or cigarettes, but they are generally harmless. They will often make up the usual stories about needing a train fare etc. Simply say "Sorry, no" and they will usually leave you alone.

<p>Sydney has some of the violent crime issues that plague major cities, however, in general, no special precautions are required visiting the typical tourist areas during the day.
</p><p>Most assaults in Sydney take place in or near pubs and nightclubs at night, and involve alcohol. Most involve young males as perpetrators and victims. Most robberies occur in nearby quiet laneways, or parks close to pubs and nightclubs at night. The most common perpetrators or robberies are drug addicts. For this reason, take care around King Cross, The Rocks, Oxford St, and the George St Cinema District, especially late at night on Fridays and Saturday nights. There has been an strong decrease of reported alcohol related violence in Kings Cross, king hits followed by death have been widely reported in the local media prior to lockout laws, but violent crime still remains relatively high compared to the rest of the city. Avoid Redfern station late at night. Women should take extra care at bars and keep an alert companion at hand, especially in the central hostel area, and take precautions against spiked drinks.
</p><p>Some areas Sydney have a reputation, generally gained by news reports of motorcycle and other gang related violence.  However, if you want to venture out into these areas during the day, there is no exceptional risk. If you're planning to head way off the tourist trail to some suburban pub or nightclub for a night out, seek some local advice.  It may be a nice pub, but it pays to be informed. Areas around railway stations tend to be hang-outs for youth gangs in Western Sydney, particularly on Friday and Saturday night.  Stay in company, and don't engage.

<p>After 9PM, smaller outer suburban stations can be very quiet, and many are totally unstaffed after this time.  The trains can also be empty when they get towards the end of the line at this time.  Don't expect a taxi to be waiting at every station--only the major ones will have a well patronised taxi rank.
</p><p>Travel in the carriage closest to the guard's compartment, which is marked with a blue light on the outside of the train. Drunk people are common on trains late at night, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.  If you ever feel concerned for your safety on any train, you can call 1800 657 926 to speak with Sydney Trains security, they can sometimes arrange for a transit patrol to board the train and provide assistance. It is generally more advisable to seek assistance from the guard however as Transit Officers are few and far between. In more modern trains, you can press the button in the entry area to speak with the guard.  Every train station has an orange emergency help point monitored by CCTV that connects to Sydney Trains security, usually towards the centre of the platform.
</p><p>Nightride buses, which replace trains after midnight, can arrange for a taxi to meet you when you get off.  Ask the driver.

<p>As Sydney is notoriously well-known for its adult entertainment, beware of a variation on the 'clip joint' <a href="/en/Scam" class="mw-redirect" title="Scam">scam</a> in Kings Cross, where bouncers will haggle with you to enter a strip club. Once inside, you will be pressured to buy (overpriced) drinks from the bar, the place will be deserted and you may be propositioned by prostitutes. If you choose to visit such types of venues, be sure to do some research beforehand into where you want to go, a quick Google search will usually help. Good venues will normally have a website and the ladies working there will not offer sex, as there are plenty of legal brothels and 'massage parlours' across Sydney.
</p><p>Other than that, there are very few tourist scams present in Sydney.

<p>If you are going to the beach, take the same precautions as you do anywhere in Australia.  See <a href="/en/Australia#Beach_going" title="Australia">Beach going</a>.
</p><p>The biggest thing to remember when swimming at any Sydney beach is swim between the yellow and red flags. These flags are placed by the lifeguards and indicate the safest place to swim at the beach away from dangerous currents. If you get into trouble while swimming, try to remain in one spot and raise your hand straight up into the air (do not wave). The lifeguards will rescue you if necessary.
</p><p>Sydney is generally sunny and UV radiation is higher than in the places where many tourists come from (Europe and North America). Make sure to wear a hat, sunglasses, and apply sunscreen (minimum SPF 30+) regularly.
</p><p>Sydney has no really dangerous jellyfish. Bluebottles (Portugese Man-Of-War) are blueish-purple stingers that hit the Sydney beaches a couple of days every summer, when the wind direction is right. They have an air-bladder that floats on the water, and stinging tenticles.  Often the air-bladder can be no bigger than a coin.  You will see the evidence of them with their air-bags washed up on the beach if they are present. They can give a painful sting - even when on the beach - but it won't keep everyone out of the water.  Apply a heat pack if you can, or ice, or salt water. The best way to remove the pain is to run the affected area under the hottest water you can stand.  Vinegar is useless.  Sometimes small transparent jellyfish appear in the harbour and estuaries.  You can usually avoid any groups of them, but they are mostly harmless.  More rarely larger purple jellyfish are in the harbour and other estuaries.  If you see these in the estuaries, best to stay out of their way.  Probably more of an issue to water skiers than to swimmers.
</p><p>Sydney ocean beaches all have shark mesh nets around 100 metres out to sea, and are regularly patrolled by air for sharks.  A shark alarm will sound if any are sighted, and you should get out of the water.  The risk of shark attack swimming on a patrolled beach between the flags is virtually nil.  Shark attacks are rare on Sydney beaches, but they have occurred, although there have been no fatal attacks for 45 years.  Advice is to avoid swimming in murky water after storms, or at dusk or at dawn, and to swim in the netted enclosures within the harbour and other estuaries.

<ul><li>Drive across the Bell's Line of Road over the Blue Mountains to the <b>Western Plains</b>. Buy produce (apples, pears, chestnuts and berries) from the orchard vendors at the side of the road if driving over in autumn. A few of these orchards also offer pick-your-own. Towns to stop by include Lithgow, which is at the foot of the mountains; Bathurst, home to the Mount Panorama motor racetrack, and Orange (3 hours from Sydney), a beautiful rustic town with a great (cold climate) wine district and several fantastic restaurants by eminent chefs, and which is fast becoming a wine-and-foodie region of New South Wales to upstage the Hunter Valley.</li>
<li>Travel up into the wilderness area of the <b><a href="/en/Blue_Mountains" title="Blue Mountains">Blue Mountains</a></b>. There are a number of good day walks in the Katoomba area, or you could tour <b><a href="/en/Jenolan_Caves" title="Jenolan Caves">Jenolan Caves</a></b>. These are easily accessible on the NSW TrainLink network to Katoomba.</li>
<li><b><a href="/en/Royal_National_Park_(New_South_Wales)" class="mw-redirect" title="Royal National Park (New South Wales)">Royal National Park</a></b>, in the south of Sydney and accessible by train has nice 1 to 2 day walks.</li>
<li>Newnes Glen in <b><a href="/en/Wollemi_National_Park" title="Wollemi National Park">Wollemi National Park</a></b>.</li>
<li><b><a href="/en/Kanangra_Boyd_National_Park" title="Kanangra Boyd National Park">Kanangra Boyd National Park</a></b>.</li>
<li>Take a tour of the <b><a href="/en/Hunter_Valley#Wineries" title="Hunter Valley">Hunter Valley wineries</a></b>.</li>
<li><b><a href="/en/Wollongong" title="Wollongong">Wollongong</a></b> is a lovely small city south of Sydney, accessible by driving down the F6 freeway or taking an hourly NSW TrainLink train.</li>
<li>Head up to <b><a href="/en/Gosford" title="Gosford">Gosford</a></b>  or <b><a href="/en/Woy_Woy" title="Woy Woy">Woy Woy</a></b> for some quieter, but picturesque beaches. Both of these Astowns are accessible by the <b>Central Coast and Newcastle</b> NSW TrainLink lines.</li>
<li>Head up to the regional city of <b><a href="/en/Newcastle_(New_South_Wales)" title="Newcastle (New South Wales)">Newcastle</a></b> by NSW TrainLink and take in some of the Victorian architecture and fantastic city beaches.</li></ul>
<p>Or if you are moving on:
</p>
