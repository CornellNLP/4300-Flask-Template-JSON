<p>Hoi An, once known as <i>Faifo</i>, with more than 2,000 years history, was the principal port of the Cham Kingdom, which controlled the strategic spice trade with Indonesia from the 7th to the 10th century and was a major international port in the 16th and 17th centuries - and the foreign influences are discernible to this day. 
</p><p>The culture &amp; heritage is mostly from the Cham people whose kingdom originally stretched  from Hue South to Phan Thiet (South of Nha Trang) - the Champa's most likely originally from Java.  The original Cham political capital was Tra Kieu, the commercial capital was Hoi An and the spiritual capital was My Son (Hindu). The Cham people were Hindu, and by the 10th century the influence of Arab traders to Hoi An resulted in some converting to become Muslims.  
</p><p>The second major influence was from the Chinese, firstly from traders but especially the escaping Ming Dynasty armies who after settling in Hoi An for some years moved further south and created Saigon as a major trading port.  
</p><p>The third and last major influence of culture &amp; heritage was from the Vietnamese and is fairly recent and only came after the Cham lost control of this area. For a tourist wanting Vietnamese culture &amp; heritage, <a href="/en/Hue" title="Hue">Hue</a> is a much better destination than Hoi An (but the weather is much rougher too!). 
</p><p>While the serious shipping business has long since moved to <a href="/en/Da_Nang" title="Da Nang">Da Nang</a>, the heart of the city is still the <b>Old Town</b>, full of winding lanes and Chinese-styled shophouses, which is particularly atmospheric in the evening as the sun goes down. While almost all shops now cater to the tourist trade, the architecture has been largely preserved, which is unusual in Vietnam, and renovation has proceeded slowly and carefully - it's mercifully absent of towering concrete blocks and karaoke parlours.

<p>The culture &amp; heritage that UNESCO World Heritage Site status for Hoi An Ancient Town was trying to preserve has long since gone. Since 1999, when UNESCO WHS status was awarded, there has been a massive increase in tourism - with the result that most houses have been sold by the community to speculators and shop owners to be used for commercial purposes. The former community, and with it their culture and heritage, has gone and in their place are endless indistinguishable shops, restaurants, art galleries, etc.  There are literally hundreds of tailor shops in Hoi An.  
</p><p>UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status also applies for Hoi An Ancient Town, but in reality this status, like many other UNESCO statuses, is not being cherished by site management.  
</p><p>The main thoroughfare in the Old Town is <b>Tran Phu</b>. Just south of the Old Town, across the Thu Bon River, are the islands of <b>An Hoi</b> to the west, reachable via Hai Ba Trung, and <b>Cam Nam</b> to the east, reachable via Hoang Dieu.
</p><p>Hoi An is known for clothing and shoes, with more than 600 shops catering to a very limited pool of tourists. Walk some of the streets outside the old town and you will see open-fronted workshops operating all hours where the clothes are made.

</p><p>The best option to come from Da Nang airport is booking Grab car (you need to have an app and activated account) and sharing it with other travellers. It should cost around 400,000 dong for whole car. 
</p><p>A private car from Danang airport to Hoi An costs about USD13.

This is one occasion where haggling to set a fixed price is cheaper than going by the meter, but good luck with this - despite clear signs everywhere listing fixed price fares to destinations including Hoi An (should be 400,000 dong, July 2015: this can be negotiated to a 320k fixed price if you appear to walk off a few times) most drivers seem unwilling to discuss a fixed price. Meters will typically run to around 450,000 dong. The Hoi An airport transfer is highly recommended, the cost is comparable with a taxi (about USD20) but a better car and professional service. The ride takes about 45min.

<p>There is no railway station in Hoi An. The nearest is in <a href="/en/Da_Nang" title="Da Nang">Da Nang</a>, which receives several trains a day from <a href="/en/Hanoi" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>, <a href="/en/Ho_Chi_Minh_City" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, <a href="/en/Hue" title="Hue">Hue</a>, <a href="/en/Nha_Trang" title="Nha Trang">Nha Trang</a> etc. Most travel agents and hotels can book a train ticket for you.
</p><p>Da Nang Railway Station: 202 Hai Phong, Tan Chinh Ward, Thanh Khe District, TP Da Nang, Phone: + 84 511 375-0666.
</p><p>To catch the public 'yellow bus' from the train station to Hoi An, exit the station, walk across the car park and continue straight out Hoang Hoa Tham road with the train station behind you. Shortly after you reach a cross road with a Pizza Hut on the opposite left hand corner. The bus stop is 50m left of Pizza Hut at 299 Le Duan road, a tailor's shop, with a blue and white sign for bus #01 and #09.  Bus #01 for Hoi An passes by every 20 minutes until 6pm.  Note—busses on this route routinely attempt to overcharge foreigners.  The correct posted fare is 20k, but you may be asked to pay as much as 5x this amount.  Conductors make an amusing effort to shield from tourists what the other passengers are paying. Politely pointing out the correct fare, posted inside the front door, will usually drop the price down to 30k (perhaps for this reason the conductor will tell you to get on via the rear door).  Whether or not to hassle further for the real 20k is up to you. The ride terminates at the Hoi An bus station just outside the center.
</p><p>The busstop has moved further down the road, keep on walking down Le Duan Rd until you see the next bus stop. You can also check the public transport route of Google Maps, as it shows the route of the bus. The current fare seems to be 25k. No further problems. 
</p><p>Cheap Taxi Option is with www.dichungtaxi.com. They offer private cabs for 220k or shared cabs option picking up other passengers on the way for 150k. Order from the website.

<p>There are two different bus stations in Hoi An now (older guide books just show the one on D Hung Vuong)and the public buses to Da Nang leave from the station about 2km north west of the centre on Le Hong Phong.
</p><p>A <i>xe om</i> (motorbike) from Hoi An bus station to the old town should be around 10-15,000 dong.
Grab Bike is available in Hoi An! Just download the Grab app.
</p><p>Between Hoi An and DaNang there is a yellow, public bus #1. It stops just outside Hoi An city centre (about 10 min walk) and runs thru DaNang centre (here it has several, market stops). As of March 2020 the price is 20.000 dong, price on the bus is 18,000, but the fare still is 20k. Text size vary, it may be in the back. The whole trip takes about 40-50 min. 
On the bus they try to charge foreigners 50,000 dong, or more (aka close to the price of private vans from a hotel in Hoi An to the airport in Da Nang). Locals may support the scam by pretending they are also paying 50,000 dong, insist on the fare and they will lower it to 30,000, insist and pay the official one. Expect no change if you have a 20,000 dong note. So; have exact change, stay calm, be polite, firm/unbudging and point to the pricetable. They will budge!  Though it may not be pretty.
In March 2020 it worked just fine to hand over exactly 18.000 VND. On a another ride it was as easily with handing in exactly 20.000 VND. But there was no change given back, same as for local people.
</p><p>Beware of bus drivers putting your luggage at the front and sparing you the nicest front seat, likely they want you to pay 50,000 dong and threaten to kick you off (although they never will). 
</p><p>A good tip is to take photos of the fare chat on the outside of the bus before you get on. Once on the bus keep your bags close to you. When the fare collector comes around start video recording the transaction and make it obvious that you a recording them - a video is hard evidence and if reported they could lose their job. Politely offer a 20,000 vdn note and ignore any further requests for money. It does not cost any additional to have your bag on board, despite what they say (an obvious exception to this world be if you have large bags that are taking up seats etc). 
</p><p>Again they will budge and accept 20,000 vdn in order to save face. Do not get angry at them - stay calm and collected so that you don't lose face! Finally if they are genuine and do not even try to overcharge you, consider giving them a small tip! It's not about the money, it's the principle.

<p>Buses are frequent - every 20 or 30min pick time, else every hour - so you can simply sit down, have a coffee, enjoy air-con while talking to nicer locals and then jump on the next bus. Same goes for Hoi An - Da Nang. The bus passes through downtown Da Nang and near the train station as well. If you come from <a href="/en/Da_Nang" title="Da Nang">Da Nang</a> airport, the closest bus stop of the same route to Hoi An is at the roundabout where the streets Nguyễn Tri Phương and Điện Biên Phủ meet (a nice 10-15min walk, since you can walk along the lake). This bus stop is clearly marked with a road sign. Google Maps also shows the locations of bus stops for this route in Da Nang.
</p><p>There are no shortage of travel companies and private buses travelling to and from from Hoi An to destinations such as Hue, Hanoi, Saigon, Dalat and Nha Trang.

<p>The centre of Hoi An is very small and pedestrianised, so you will be <b>walking</b> around most of the time. Motorbikes are only banned from the centre of town during certain times of day, so keep an eye out for them; even in the most narrow alleys. Evenings are especially busy with motorbikes two, or even three abreast competing with pedestrians for even the smallest space on the street! 
</p><p>The city's government does not allow motorbikes to enter the Old Town on the 14th and 15th of each lunar month. On those evenings, a lot of activities, including traditional games such as <i>bai choi</i>, <i>trong quan</i>, and <i>dap nieu</i> are held in all over the town.
</p>

<p>You can easily get around on a bicycle to most of Hoi An's attractions, as motorcycle and car traffic is banned from the city center's tourist area during most daylight hours. You can use a bicycle to go the beach or reach some of the more remote hotels. It is easy and cheap to hire a <b>bicycle</b>  (c. 20,000 dong per day in Jan 2013). For <b>mountain bikes</b>, head to Anh Cuoc shop, at 635 Hai Ba Trung. 
</p><p>Traffic in the area of Hoi An is minimal, so if you've been avoiding getting on a bike in the big cities, small towns and the surrounding countryside like Hoi An are ideal to get used to the road rules.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_taxi">By taxi</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Hoi_An&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: By taxi">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Taxis  can be found in the middle of Le Loi St, over the river on An Hoi or called by phone. When busy, taxis may refuse your fare back to your hotel from town if it is too close, opting for larger fares. Arranging a shuttle from your hotel may be a better option although prices can be higher. A local 15 minute taxi fare is around 60,000 dong.
</p><p><b>Motorbike taxis</b>, of course, are always an option. Some shops have <b>electrical bicycles</b> (especially along Duong CuanDai, close to the centre -75.000 dong, Jan 2013). You can also charter <b>boats</b>  for about US$1/hour.
Cost of motorbike rentals in Hoi An town was 80-100,000 dong in Feb 2013 although a hotel may charge double. You get a step-thru with auto clutch. These can handle two full sized adults easily enough. There are any number of small shops renting them, you will be offered a helmet usually. Take it every time - there are plenty of roadside helmet checks. Failure to wear one results in the bike being confiscated and a USD75 fine. Worse, you probably haven't got a Vietnamese driving license and there are no papers to sign, no agreements made so you are on your own legally. 
</p><p>Ride to the outskirts of Danang to visit the stunning Marble Mountains. If you look left from An Ban beach, you can see the Marble Mountains (3 prominent lumpy hills) clearly - the high rises further on are Da Nang. Bear in mind the total lack of signposts, and just keep looking left at the flat terrain until it isn't flat any more! You are on a dual carriageway road all the way. It's standard practice for the bike to have only enough gas to make it a few metres to the next gas station. 
</p><p>In addition to gas stations, there are also little hand-operated roadside pumps everywhere; these can be convenient, but they're more expensive. The proprietor may show you a sign with a few calculations for non-Vietnamese speakers such as 3 litres is 90,000 dong. You actually see the gas draining through a calibrated sight glass. In a commercial gas station they can, and do bang in half a tank then shut the machine off to serve someone else. The amount in money has gone from the display, and he tells you a totally made up figure. All this makes the roadside hand pump with sight glass a lot more foreigner friendly. Gas costs around 25,000 dong/litre and one litre is enough for sightseeing to the beach and back and zipping around town. If you take a trip - lets say you ride to My Son 2-up - then you will use about 4L. It's inevitable that you will get lost 5 times between Hoi An and and My Son! Luckily fuel is cheaper out in the countryside.
</p><p><b>Important</b>: foreign International Driving Licences are NOT valid in Vietnam and in case of accident, a foreigner driving a motorcycle without a valid licence is at fault and will pay!  Also personal insurance may not be valid for someone riding on a motorcycle with a driver who does not have a valid license.

<p>To enter most of the main attractions in the Old Town (i.e. the handful of buildings that aren't shops) you require a ticket (120,000 dong), which is sold at various kiosks. You certainly do not (usually) require a ticket just to walk the streets. But it can seem that way since the main entrance to the Old Town is the Japanese covered bridge, which being one of the attractions /does/ require the ticket. But there's nothing to stop you using the nearby footway on the waterfront instead.
</p><p>Piped (western, classical) music throughout the main old town streets adds to the crass Disneyland feel.
</p><p>An "it's ok to rip off the foreigners" attitude is pervasive throughout Hoi An (much more so then in most Vietnamese cities).  Cyclo drivers charge 300,000 Dong ($15 U.S.) for a ride that would cost less than 20,000 Dong ($1 U.S.) in other cities of Vietnam.  Restaurants in the Old Town area are VERY expensive, charging four times what most restaurants would charge and serving portions that are half the typical size.
</p><p>Once purchased, the old town ticket (120,000 dong) includes five <b>coupons</b> that can be used to enter five attractions of your choosing: museums, old houses, assembly halls, the handicraft workshop (and traditional music show) or the traditional theatre, and either the Japanese Covered Bridge or the Quan Cong Temple. Tickets are sold at various entry points into the Old Town, including Hai Ba Trung Street, and also at some of the attractions, including the Cantonese Assembly Hall. The city requests that visitors dress "decently" while visiting sites in the Old Town. Men should wear a shirt and women shouldn't wear bikini tops, sleeveless blouses or skirts above the knees. Respect the local culture and remember that you are not on the beach.
</p><p>If you are not into visiting some fairly mediocre museums (see below for details), do not purchase the coupon or you will feel cheated - there is not much to see otherwise.
</p><p>If you have the opportunity to visit a long-established Chinese expat community elsewhere in Asia - Malaysia, Singapore, Chinatown in any of the large cities of Thailand or the Philippines - consider skipping Hoi An entirely.

<p>First, you may choose one of the two <b>landmarks</b> of Hoi An:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Japanese Covered Bridge's Pagoda</b> (<i>Chua Cau</i> or <i>Lai Vien Kieu</i>). The Bridge is located on the west end of Tran Phu Street, but the ticket is ONLY required to access the annexed pagoda on one side of the bridge's interior; the bridge itself is free for crossing. The bridge was constructed in the early 1600's by the Japanese community, roughly 40 years before they left the city to return to Japan under the strict policy of <i>sakoku</i> enforced by the Tokugawa Shogunate, and renovated in 1986. Today, it's the symbol of Hoi An.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Precious_Heritage_Museum"><span class="fn org">Precious Heritage Museum</span>, <span class="adr"><span class="street-address">26 Phan Boi Chau</span></span>, <span class="tel"><abbr class="type" title="voice">☎</abbr> <span class="phone value">0510 6558 382</span></span>, <a class="url external autonumber" href="https://www.facebook.com/precious.heritage.museum.art.gallery/" rel="nofollow">[x]</a>. <span class="description">A 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by Réhahn during the past 5 years of the french photographer's explorations of Vietnam. </span> <span class="price">Free Entrance</span>. </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Quan Cong Temple</b>, 24 Tran Phu Street.</li></ul>
<p>The ticket allows admission to four <b>museums</b> in the Old Town (one ticket-one museum):
</p>
<ul><li><b>Museum of Folk Culture</b>, 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street. Some may be put off by the bizarre-looking plaster sculptures of Vietnamese peasants, but this museum documents the dress and culture of rural Vietnam.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Museum of Trade Ceramics</b>, 80 Tran Phu Street. The dusty, unlabeled displays of broken pottery are eminently forgettable, but the house itself is nice enough, and it provides a better opportunity to explore the shape and layout of an old Hoi An home than you'll find at any of the Old Houses (below).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.citypassguide.com/en/travel/hoi-an/attractions/museums/hoi-an-museum-of-history-and-culture">Hoi An Museum of History and Culture</a></b>, 7 Nguyen Hue Street. The museum contains some old black and white photos of Hoi An taken in the early 20th century. It also houses an old canon, some two-thousand year old pots from the Sa Huynh period, and a case full of 9th century bricks and tiles from the Champa period.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Museum of Sa Huynh Culture</b>, 149 Bach Dang Street. The museum's main collection consists of pottery and urns from the 1st and 2nd centuries. Upstairs, there used to be another museum, the Museum of the Revolution. Its main collection consists of pictures from war heroes and a collection of weapons such as grenade launchers, machine guns and AK47s. However, this collection has now been relocated to the new museum building at the top of Le Loi Street, and is not currently open to the public.</li></ul>
<p>There are three <b>old houses</b> that exist in an awkward halfway state between museum show-piece and somewhat shabby residence for the family that lives there. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Phung Hung House</b>, 4 Nguyen Thi Minh Khai Street, just west of the Japanese Bridge. Traditional two-story wooden house, inhabited over 100 years by eight generations; and the current one attempts to guide you around in hope of a tip.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Quan Thang House</b>, 77 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Tan Ky House</b>, 101 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street. As above, a younger member of the family will provide a cup of tea and a "tour" that doesn't stray from the front room of the house, as you'd need to step over sleeping members of the older generation to go anywhere else. The design of the house shows how local architecture incorporated Japanese and Chinese influences. Japanese elements include the crab shell-shaped ceiling supported by three beams in the living room. Chinese poems written in mother-of-pearl are hanging from a number of the columns that hold up the roof.</li></ul>
<p>Numerous <b>congregation halls</b>, where Chinese expatriate residents socialized and held meetings, are dotted about the town. They are typically named after the home region of their members, such as Fujian and Canton. Some do not have ticket-takers, so it's up to your conscience if you want to try wandering into a second.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Cantonese Assembly Hall</b> (<i>Quang Dong</i>), 176 Tran Phu Street. Built in 1885, it has a calm courtyard with ornate statuary. Take a peek at the half-hidden back yard and its kitschy pastel dragon statues.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Hokien (Fujian) Meeting Hall</b> (<i>Phuc Kien</i>), 46 Tran Phu Street. Built in 1757.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Chinese All-Community Meeting Hall</b> (<i>Trieu Chau</i>), 157 Nguyen Duy Hieu. Built in 1887. It's near the Fujian hall, also spanning the block.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, you can choose one of the following to get some "Intangible Culture":
</p>
<ul><li><b>Hoi An Handicraft Workshop</b>, 9 Bach Dang Street. Folk music performances are offered at 10:15 and 15:15 every day except Monday. The performances last about 20 minutes.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Traditional Theatre</b>, 75 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street.</li>
<li><b>Swan Boats</b> on the river near the footbridge. Make sure you check out the swan boats on the river. These are literally passenger boats shaped like giant swans whose eyes light up at night and which play 'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town' at double speed.</li></ul>

<li><b>Hire a motorbike to Hue</b> You can hire a motorbike all over Hoi An, but MotorVina have offices in Hoi An, De Nang and Hue and offer a free emergency recovery service (or will pay for a local mechanic to fix what needs fixing). For $2 extra they will transport your luggage to their office in Hue so you can ride freely! They will also pick you up from your accommodation in Hoi An for free to get you to their office. We organised it through our hostel and paid $15/person (not including luggage transport) so I'm sure it can be negotiated down from this.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Long-tail boat, kayak or small round boat (thúng)</b> rides down the river. Mr. Phap (0906 416 433) offers round boat rides through the water coconut groves for 1-2 ppl, 50k/person/hour (anything you'd pay beyond that price is just others' commissions). You can see some wildlife living in the shallow waters, and he might even make you a leaf hat! Address: To 2 Thon Van Lang.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Walk around the old town at night</b>. The most popular activity to do is actually quite simple; as sundown approaches until 21:30, the old town lights up with lanterns and other lights and attracts window shopping and peaceful evening walks. The majority of activity happens in the old town during this time window when the temperature is cooler, and is a great time to stroll around and explore shops, restaurants, people watch, and simply soak in the beauty of Hoi An. The street lanterns shut down approximately 21:30 and vendors and food stalls follow suit in the following hour. By around 22:30, most vendors, bars, and restaurants are closed with only late night bars and a few food stands remaining.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Play or relax at the beach - Although it is situated 4km away, the beach north east of old town (An Bang) is a popular place to go for a swim, splash in the water, eat food from vendors that serve food under the shade of palm trees that overlook the beach, or at night to eat at one of the many seafood restaurants that also offer beach views.

There are also several established cooking schools with good reputations including "Rice Drum", "Morning Glory" and "Red Bridge" who offer a variety of courses ranging in price US$16-55. <b>In any of these "good reputation" schools, as a hands on experience, you can only learn as far as how to chop the vegetables, assemble ingredients, and go through the cooking process.</b> While a demonstration is held on what ingredients are needed, some of the basic sauces or flavoring is given to you pre-made. A different approach is to inquire in a restaurant where you eat if they can arrange a cooking class for you; in smaller establishments the cost will be lower ($10-$20 USD) and more intimate though less organized. Another option is simply asking if you can observe the cooking process once you order your food. For example, at the "Green Moss" restaurant, just walk in around midday or in the evening, choose 2 dishes, and you can watch them prepare it while you take notes on how to do it. The cook's explanations are good, and it's quite an efficient way for only USD2 (in addition to the cost of the dishes). The kitchen looks chaotic, but the food is really good.</li></ul>

<p>One tourist trap all shoppers in Hoi An must know is that almost everybody earns commission from referring buying customers to shoes and tailor shops. The standard commission rate paid by tailor shops to every receptionist, door boy, taxi drivers, hotel bus drivers, staff of 5 star resorts or any random stranger is 35%. Some of those "highly recommended" stores can appear popular, crowded and even offer cheap prices, but in reality are only pure shop fronts that leverage on cheap but low quality outsourcing.

<p>Few tailors namely Vanda Tailors and Yaly Couture have their in-house production and do not outsource. Most tailor shops are not actual tailors but more of store front owners. In every tailor shop, you can choose the colour and material, and dictate every part of the style. Measurements are taken and the specifications are either sent out for fabrication at a factory or workshop outside the city or rarely made in-house. 
</p><p>The suit is usually complete by the next day, though for best results there is then a second (or even third) fitting, when they adjust the suit to more accurately suit your body and tastes. Most shops will keep tailoring it until you are satisfied. 
</p><p>If there are no tailors working in the shop or if the store is not able to show you the details or components that goes inside a suit, most likely the tailor store front is outsourcing and do not have their own production
</p><p>While outsourcing is economical for store fronts as the shop only pay a set price for each item made, many tailor shop owners that outsource have no idea about the construction techniques, the consistency, the interior details such as threads, interlining, canvassing, shoulder pads, buttons etc. The quality that is put out is obviously variable, uncontrolled and as a general rule quite low. The actual tailors want to maximize profit and use the cheapest materials available to make the end product. Corners are also cut as payment is made per piece; the more pieces you stitch, the more money you earn, which obviously compromises quality.
</p><p>There is typically no elaborate, multiple fitting and re-fitting process with most of these tailors. If not specifically requested, you will most likely only ever deal with shop owners who outsource the actual tailoring work to sweat shops in the outskirts of town, and who may not even know how to or care about translating your fitting requests to the actual people doing the work. Outsourcing tailoring work also means that shop owners have a strong incentive to minimize additional fittings and rework as it will cut into their profit margins.
</p><p><b>Caveat emptor</b> - and remember where you are: there is no trade association, Office of Fair Trading or similar to complain to if you are not happy.
</p><p>If you do insist on getting something done, <b>below are a couple of hopefully helpful tips how to approach the situation.</b> Getting tailored clothes done in Hoi An can be a fun and budget-friendly experience, just be sure to know what to expect and how to minimize the risk of being taken advantage of. Come prepared with a healthy dose of scepticism when listening to the sales pitch and make sure that the shop's interests are aligned with yours. Make sure that you have leverage to get refitting work done until you are happy (see below). Do not just rely on sweetly smiling shop assistants and their promises - there is usually a clear inverse relationship between the friendliness of their tone and how much money you have already parted with:
</p><p><i><b>-Pre-pay as little as possible:</b></i> Paying a significant deposit takes away the only leverage you have with shop owners to facilitate multiple 'real' fittings with tailors present. Shop owners will ask for significant or even full pre-payment to 'cover upfront costs', 'buy cloth', 'pay staff', 'cover urgent hospital bills for the ill grandmother', etc. Customers should resist this as much as possible. While it may not be easy to get the prepayment down to zero (not impossible, though), never pay more than ~25%. If the shop refuses, simply walk out and find a more reasonable one. Paying more will greatly reduce the shop's incentive to deliver a product which you are truly happy with: Deposits are never returned if the customer is not happy with the product. If you decide not to buy a substandard piece but have already paid most of the price, the shop will simply sell your clothes to the next customer, after some alterations, and keep your money - effectively selling the clothes twice.
</p><p><i><b>-Stand your ground and ask for rework if you are not fully satisfied.</b></i> Politely, but clearly and repeatedly state that you will not pay for the piece if rework is not done to your satisfaction (note, however, that this will only work if you have not already paid a significant deposit - see above). Don't hesitate to deliver this message in a confident voice, especially if other potential customers are within earshot. Also, insist on having the tailor doing the actual work present at all fittings. Make this clear on your first visit. If unhappy with the results of fittings, insist on going to the tailor's workshop for final alterations until you are happy. This may be resisted as workshops are typically squalid affairs which shop owners don't want their usually Western clients to see (Yes, your tailored clothes are really only that cheap because you are taking advantage of extremely low wages in Vietnam.).
</p><p><i><b>-Know what you want, bring samples of what you like and check every piece thoroughly:</b></i> It is always a good idea to know in advance which 'specs' you want for your custom clothes (collar shape, cuff type, monograms, etc for shirts, for example). Bring a list if necessary. If you have something more unusual done and order multiple pieces, have them do one piece first and check that you like what you see. It helps a lot to bring a piece of your clothing where you like the cut or which has some obscure detail you would like replicated. Do not assume that local tailors are familiar with the intricacies of bespoke tailoring and the myriad of options and customization available which a more traditional tailor is familiar with and can advise you on. It is also a good idea to have the shop confirm to you in writing what you have ordered, including all the specs and prices you have agreed upon. Finally, when you receive the product make sure to check that all the  details have been done as agreed - on every piece. 
</p><p><i><b>-Quality has its price, including in Hoi An:</b></i> If you go for the cheapest shop or cloth on offer you will be disappointed. Choosing a good suit is not just about comparing prices. Workmanship and what goes into the suit can largely vary. This does not mean, however, that you should not negotiate. It's part of the experience.
</p><p><i><b>-Bring enough time and don't go for the 24h-suit (unless you want to look like a clown):</b></i> You will need at least a few days for proper fittings. Let the shop owner know that you have enough time to come in multiple times. A negotiating tactic may involve being vague on your departure date - once more unscrupulous shop owners know when you need to leave they might string you along and not invest their time and money for proper fittings.
</p><p><i><b>-Obviously, shop around* <span class="vcard"></span>, do some on-line research or get personal recommendations before making a financial commitment.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>-Get a receipt and keep it:</b></i> This can be helpful if some eager customs inspector at your home airport decides to query you about how much your custom made clothing has cost as he may suspect that you are above the duty-free limit.

<p>Hoi An has a long tradition of copying and then rapidly making up new garments for travellers.
</p><p>You can bring in clothes (or even a picture of clothes) that you want copied to any tailor shop and they will try to imitate it. You can often choose the type of fabric and the colour for the copy. You can bargain for a better price, especially if you are getting multiple copies.
</p><p><b>Bargaining when having custom clothes made:</b> Custom clothes will cost more than ready-made in Vietnam, but should not cost anywhere near as much as in North America/Europe/Australia. You should aim for a fair price, with which both you and the shop owner are happy. If you are not happy with the price, you can go to one of the multitude of other stores in the city; if they are not happy, or feel you are being unfair in your negotiations, there is a chance they will not try as hard to make sure you are satisfied with the result.
</p><p>When you first see the exterior of the Hoi An Cloth Market, a squat building that has seen better times, your first inclination will be to make like Usain Bolt and, well, bolt. Especially when you spy the mouldy green interior walls. But resist that impulse and bravely make your way through this warren of small stalls.

<p>All the shoe shops in Hoi An will make custom shoes for you. The greatest concentration of shoe stores is along Hoang Dieu street, where there are at least eight (small) stores in a row. You can ask them to make you a style that you see there, or one in a catalogue or picture. You can choose the material, colour and type of base. While some shops may work from conventional sizing, most will simply trace an outline of your foot and take some measurements. As with the custom clothes, the fabrication is usually done a little outside of town, or at least in an area with lower rent costs.

<p><b>WARNING</b>: Not all the shops are reliable and willing to refund your deposit if you are not satisfied with their work. Agree on a small deposit, if they are confident on their skills they will agree too. Asking if they will be able to make the shoes as required is not enough, because consistently with the local mindset about <i>not losing face</i>, they will never say "no, we don't have the know-how to make your shoes this or that way". So be extremely specific, don't forget to mention the colour of the stitchings (unless you like the stitching with a different colour from the leather). Ask them about the base, or you'll get a leather shoe with a plastic base cloned from some brand, and even if they trace the outline of your foot, you may find a different sized base, because they don't actually make the base custom sized. If you are not satisfied and want your deposit refunded, the shop attendants may start being aggressive and verbally abusing. The police are not going to enforce your "rights" (naively assuming you have any, as a foreigner customer). This warning is based on a negative experience at Lộc Phước, 45 Trần Phú Street, Hoi An.

<p>There are three dishes that Hoi An is particularly famous for:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Cao lầu</b>, a dish of rice noodles which are not quite as slippery as pho and a bit closer in texture to pasta. The secret is the water used to make it, and authentic cao lau uses only water from a special well in the city. The noodles are topped with slices of roast pork, dough fritters, and this being Vietnam, lots of fresh herbs and veggies.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>White rose</b> (<i>banh bao vac</i>), a type of shrimp dumpling made from translucent white dough bunched up to look like a rose.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Wonton dumplings</b> ("Hoanh Thanh"), essentially the same as the Chinese kind, served up in soup or deep-fried.</li></ul>
<p>The Central Market is a large building whose interior serves primarily as a place for food vendors. The vendors offer food all day starting in the morning. Seating on stools, eating a bowl of Cao Lau with wooden chopsticks, and sipping the ice cold "White Coffee with vinamilk" is an adventure. However, be warned that it is standard procedure for all food vendors to approach you immediately on entrance and try aggressively to have you sit at their stall.
</p><p>If you wish to avoid choosing, a particular stall that serves Cao Lau has garnered the praise of Anthony Bourdain and is generally known as one of the best places in town. It can be identified by said label placed on the pillar behind the stall. Prices will vary atrociously, as shopkeepers swarm over you to sell you things, or even shove plates of food before you. Just keep declining politely and return the food if you don't fancy it. Keep small denominations of dong with you, as you probably won't get change if you give them US$. Also, confirm the prices before you partake of the food. Prices range from about 7000-20000 dong for a bowl of Cao Lau noodles, and 5000-7000 dong for a coffee. The baguette is a nice snack, and should not cost more than 10000 dong. You can point and say yes or no to the vegetables and chilli that they will add. Mineral water is around 10000 dong for a big 1.5L bottle.
</p><p>Walking along the river at night, you will find a lot of pubs. Beer is around 30000 dong. Cocktails are around 20000-50000 dong. There are some bar foods available, such as fried prawn crackers for around 15000 dong a plate. Just walk into any pub and have a seat. Keep an eye out for "fresh beer" signs in some bars and restaurants; they sell very chilled glasses (probably half pint) of beers at the ridiculously cheap prices of 3000 to 5000 dong. These beers are produced by Viet A Breweries and are quite good. Do also look out for "Happy Hour" boards too.
</p><p>Avoid the riverside cafe called Cafe Can. The cafe has the worst reviews of any in town. Customers complain about appalling service.

<p>Prices in the very centre of Hoi An are generally a little inflated by the tourist trade - An Hoi island is no longer the bastion of cheap street stalls that it once was; or if it ever was. The tourist trade has really hurt the prices of all areas of town.  Don't pay more than 10,000 dong for a baguette; 10,000 dong for a beer (most places want 10-15,000 dong); and 20,000 dong for a bowl of noodles. Look for the signs "FRESH BEER" -it's a glass (300mL) for 4,000 dong up. Great value. Bike towards An Bang beach and check out some of the street side restaurants for some cheaper eats.

<ul><li>An Hoi Island, which is the western of the two islands that connect to Old Town, lights up with bars in the evening replete with colorful lanterns and blaring modern pop music. They stay open until after midnight, and cater specifically to the foreign crowd. They are all located on a single strip along the north side of An Hoi overlooking the river, so it is easy to spot which ones are full of people and which ones are more quiet, depending on your social preference.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Sunflower Hostel - Located east of old town and about a 10-15 minute walk, it is primarily a hostel. However, as one of the most popular hostels in Hoi An, it also serves as a drinking venue that is filled with backpackers that want to mingle and drink until the wee hours of the morning.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Casual open-air bars - There are many places to casually drink in quiet, relaxed venues all over Old Town. In particular, along the south end of Le Loi street, and all along Nguyễn Thái Học street are many of these types of bars. Mango, Tam Tam, Q Bar, Before and Now, are examples of bars along these streets that seem to be slightly more occupied than others (at least in the off season).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Volcano Club - a rather empty club (at least in July 2014) that is situated on the north side of Old Town, but is one of the few drinking establishments that is a club rather than a bar.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Why Not? Bar - a small bar located on the east side of town.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Zero Sea Mile Bar - while blogs on the internet sing the praises of this nightclub that oversees the Cua Dai beach (and according to several false reports of it temporarily being closed for renovations but now open), it has been permanently closed and is no longer in existence as of July 2014. Despite conflicting information on the internet, its closure has been verified in person by and no replacement venue has taken its place. In other words, there are no discotheques in the beach area, as Zero Sea Mile is touted as being the one and only. Don't believe any locals that tell you otherwise, as some still genuinely believe it is still in existence based on heresay.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Cafe Bonsai - The place seems more about growing bonsais but for me they had the best Vietnamese coffee in town. You find it going South East on Đinh Tiên Hoàng, it is about 70 meters (left hand) after the intersection with Hai Bà Trưng. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cafe-Bonsai">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cafe-Bonsai</a></li></ul>

<p><b>Hoi An New Town</b><br />
The atmosphere of the Old Town hasn't been preserved by accident: strict bylaws prohibit new construction within its narrow lanes. As a result, there's a building boom just outside the borders of the Old Town, most noticeably as you head north of Le Hong Phong. Walk a few blocks from that old world ambiance, and suddenly you're in a construction zone. Several hotels have sprung up in this area, which is completely lacking in the charm that brings visitors to Hoi An. Not surprisingly, those are the hotels (Phuong Nam Hotel is among the worst offenders) that are most likely to pay commissions to open-tour bus companies and use Internet sites to describe the dusty construction zone as a "peaceful area". They're also cheaper and easier to bargain with, but the reason they're so cheap is that they're missing the whole point of a visit to Hoi An. There are plenty of options closer to the centre of town. Once you've taken a night-time stroll through the Old Town, you won't mind if you had to fork over an extra dollar or two for a better location.

<p><br />
Hotels in Hoi An are fiercely competitive, which means plenty of choice and generally high standards. Budget options are slightly pricier than many other parts of Vietnam, with $6 being about the cheapest. Around the centre, 300,000 VND is usually the lowest asking price (March 2013). Heading further out of town, more typical prices can be found. Many hotels are clustered around <b>Hai Ba Trung St</b> and <b>Ba Trieu St</b>, just north of the Old Town and within easy walking distance, and also along <b>Cua Dai Street</b>, off to the east and a bit of a hike away.
</p><p>Most of Hoi An's high-end hotels are located along the unbroken beach stretching from Danang to Hoi An. Closest is Cua Dai Beach 5 km away.
</p><p>It is more likely to find a good bargain in the evening, when budget hotels try to fill their rooms for the night.
