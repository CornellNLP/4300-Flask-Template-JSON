<p>While the Veneti had long inhabited northeastern Italy and a small population of fishermen known as "lagooners" had long lived on the islands of modern Venice, the city's true beginning point came when refugees fled to the marshlands from the surrounding Roman cities to escape marauding barbarians. The first wave of immigrants fled the Quadi and Marcomanni in the 160's A.D. In the 5th Century, more came to escape the Visigoths and the Huns, and in the 6th Century, yet more arrived seeking safe haven from the Lombards.

<p>With the Western Roman Empire destroyed and Lombardy ever threatening from across the lagoon, Venice welcomed help from the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in the 6th Century. The Byzantines organized the thin coastal strip into the <i>Exarchate of Ravenna</i> and ruled it from Constantinople. The sheer distance and the lack of a land connection to Venice, however, left Venice rather isolated- and isolation bred a desire for autonomy. In 726, a rebellion broke out, and the Byzantine Exarch was murdered. Venetians then elected their first of a long series of 117 <i>doges</i> (dukes). However, Venice immediately resubmitted itself to the Byzantines under their new leader, perhaps to avoid Papal or Lombard domination.

<p>Venice gradually morphed into a fully independent city state between the 9th and 12th Centuries A.D., and its naval and mercantile might soon led to its status as the link between the East and much of Western and Central Europe.<br />It thrived on the necessity to manage a water-borne lifestyle with all the maritime skills developed for that, its isolation with nobody to interfere in daily life and its ideal position at the mouth of the Alpine passes and nearby trading partners.<br />An empire was formed that included <a href="/en/Crete" title="Crete">Crete</a>, a collection of Aegean islands, the Istrian Peninsula, the Dalmatian Coast and areas inland from Venice all the way up to the Alpine slopes. By 1300, Venice was the wealthiest city on the European continent. During the Middle Ages, Venice gained valuable trading privileges with the Byzantines, successfully resisted the power of the Papacy and became the "printing capital of the world."

<p>When Venice unsuccessfully tried to defend <a href="/en/Thessaloniki" title="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> and Constantinople from the Ottomans, the end result was a costly 30-year war, the loss of their overseas possessions and elimination of their top trading partner. Next, the discovery of new routes to Asia by the Portuguese in the 1490's reduced the relative value of Mediterranean commerce. Finally, in 1575, 1577 and 1630 plagues drastically reduced Venice's population.
</p><p>In 1797, Venice was conquered by the French under Napoleon, then quickly transferred to Austrian rule in 1798. Napoleon again took the city in 1805 and again lost it to Austria in 1814. A revolt broke out in 1848 but was crushed by 1849. Finally, in 1866, Venice joined a newly united Italy.

<p>Under Mussolini, in 1933, Venice's long-time Jewish population was deported. During World War II, the city center was not bombed much, but its rail connections to the mainland and its few industrial areas were targeted repeatedly. By the time Allied troops came to liberate the city on April 29th, 1945, rebels had already freed it from Nazi control.
</p><p>Since World War II, Venice's population has shrunk by 50% as many have moved to the mainland. However, the tourist industry has boomed and become the city's economic mainstay. Despite a devastating flood in 1966, the city has recovered and become one of the top tourist destinations in Europe.

<p>The worst times to visit may be during the carnival and when it's raining; Venice can get very dark and rainy. Depending on when you visit, you might even have to buy waterproof shoes, which are sold on the streets for around €20. When it's raining there are mosquitoes and occasional infestations of flies. Spring and fall are probably best, a compromise between temperature (expect 5-15°C in March) and the tourist load. Between November and January, you may manage to feel you have Venice all to yourself, an interesting and quiet experience. Beware of the weather during the winter months: it can be quite cold, windy, and damp. Fog is an additional hazard if you are driving in or out, doubly so in the unlikely chance that you will pilot a boat. That said, if you've never been to Venice, it's better to go in summer than not to go. You won't regret it. Many cities are far worse in summer, and Venice has no cars, hence no smog.  
</p><p><i><b>Acqua alta</b></i> (high water) has become a fact of life in Venice.  The lagoon water level occasionally rises above the level of the squares and streets, flooding them.  This can happen several times a year, at irregular intervals, usually in the colder months. Acqua alta usually lasts a few hours and coincides with high tide. You'll see raised walkways in side alleys ready to be pulled out when <i>acqua alta</i> hits. When the city begins to flood, sirens will sound to warn residents and businesses. If you speak fluent Italian, tune into news programs since their predictions of the times the flood begins and ends are usually on the spot. Normally, the tide rises and falls in six-hour cycles. 
</p><p>You can get an <i>acqua alta</i> map at the tourist offices either at the railway station or St Marks.  This will show you the higher, dry routes and the ones with walkways set up during the various flood alerts.  There is a tide measuring station at the Rialto vaporetto piers, and a noticeboard at the base of the Campanile in the Piazza San Marco that shows a live tide reading and predictions for the next few days.

<p>Since Medieval Times, Venice has frequently served as a source of inspiration to a wide variety of authors, poets and dramatists. It has also long been a major print center, having been home to some of the earliest Italian printing presses. The deep and diverse literary tradition at Venice is too extensive to cover comprehensively in short space, but we can get an overview of some of the most notable works associated with the city throughout history:
</p>
<ul><li><b>The Travels of Marco Polo</b> is a classic piece of Western Literature that holds an important place historically since the reports of Marco Polo's voyage to the distant, little-known East became a major inspiration to later European exploration of the world. Polo was a Venetian merchant who surveys lands he passed through from the Near East all the way to Cathay (China).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Story of My Life,</b> by Giacomo Casanova, is an 18th Century work by another Venetian merchant-traveler. His autobiography chronicles many adventures that center around Venice, but it is also an important source of information on social customs of the time.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ruzante,</b> who real name was <i>Angelo Beolco,</i> was a 16th-Century Venetian playwright who is famous for his vivid, if sometimes coarse, plays about country life in the vicinity of his native <a href="/en/Padua" class="mw-redirect" title="Padua">Padua</a>. Two of his well known works are <i>La Pastoral</i> and <i>Oratione.</i></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Carlo Goldoni</b> was a Venice resident who wrote some of Italy's most famous plays, many of them centered around the lives, values and problems of the Venetian middle class. Although he composed his plays in Italian and French, he intersperses Venetian quite frequently. One of his most famous works is <i>Servant of Two Masters.</i></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Carlo Gozzi</b> was a fierce proponent of "the old Italian comedy" against newer dramatic styles such as those used by Carlo Goldoni. One of his works, in fact, was a parody of their new, French-inspired style called <i>The Love for Three Oranges.</i></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ugo Foscolo</b> was a 19th-Century Venetian poet who was also a revolutionary devoted to seeing Venice made a truly free republic after its capture by Napoleon during the Napoleonic Wars. His best-remembered work was a book of poetry published in 1807 called <i>Dei Sepolcri.</i></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>The Thief Lord,</b> by Cornelia Funke, is probably the most famous children's book that is set in Venice. It is about two brothers who travel to the city, join a group of street children and have a number of adventures and misadventures.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Foreigners whose works have been inspired by the city of Venice include: <b>Shakespeare,</b> in his plays <i>Othello</i> and <i>The Merchant of Venice;</i> <b>Thomas Mann,</b> in his novela <i>Death in Venice</i>; <b>Robert Browning</b> and <b>Ezra Pound,</b> whose poems were much-inspired by his stay in Venice.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Other famous works that heavily involve Venice in the plot include: <b>The Aspern Papers,</b> an 1888 novella by Henry James; <b>Brideshead Revisited,</b> a "theological novel" by Evelyn Waugh, which extols the unmerited grace of God; and <b>In Search of Lost Time,</b> a seven-volume novel by Marcel Proust, which concerns the theme of "involuntary memory."</li></ul>

<p>In 2012, the population of Venice was estimated at 260,000, which is a major drop from earlier years- only about half the 1945 population. The population density is 1,700 per square mile- very tightly packed. The entire metropolitan area, including PAdua, TREviso and VEnice (abbreviated PATREVE), has 2.6 million residents.

<p>In 2009, the city had 270,098 people, and the population was counted by district as follows:
</p>
<ul><li>Centro Storico (historic city center): 60,000</li></ul>
<ul><li>Other isles of the lagoon: 31,000</li></ul>
<ul><li>Terraferma (mainland areas): 176,000</li></ul>
<p>Note that the population of Venice shrank by 0.2% between 2002 and 2007, while Italy's population grew by 3.9%.

<p>The residents of Venice are about 53% female and 47% male, while 14% were minors compared to 26% pensioners (seniors). The average age in Venice is 46 but only 42 in Italy as a whole.
</p><p>Ethnically, 91% of Venetians are Italian, and less than 10% hail back to the ancient Veneti bloodline. About three percent are Romani immigrants from <a href="/en/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a> or <a href="/en/Moldova" title="Moldova">Moldova</a>. Around one percent come from Bangladesh, and another one percent hail from Eastern Asia. 
</p><p>Religiously, 93% of the population is Roman Catholic. The deep historical ties, however, with Constantinople (now <a href="/en/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>) have resulted in a noticeable Orthodox presence as well. Through immigration, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism have also gotten a foothold. Finally, despite most Jews being expelled from Venice during the reign of Mussolini, a small Jewish community still remains.

<p>The people of Venice have been engaged in, and have excelled at, numerous industries over the centuries, including commerce, printing, the fine arts, manufacturing and organizing pilgrimages to the Holy Land. Today, some of the industries that remain include: shipbuilding, trade, <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> glass production and <a href="/en/Burano" title="Burano">Burano</a> lace production.
</p><p>However, tourism is by far the number one industry, and Venice is one of the most-visited tourist destinations on the planet. Specifically, it ranks 29 among world tourism cities and sees around 18 million visitors every year. The main draws are its beautiful architecture, numerous art collections and important historical landmarks. The canals and romantic gondolas, however, are probably the top reason 50,000 tourists visit Venice on a daily basis.

<p>Because Venice is on a lagoon, the water plays a crucial role in transportation.<br />Whichever way you arrive, the last part of your journey will be on foot from the nearest waterbus/watertaxi jetty, train station, or parking garage.
</p><p>Bear in mind that 
</p>
<ul><li>alleys can be very narrow or crowded, making it difficult to pass with bulky luggage.<br />Try to limit yourself to one backpack/daypack and one piece of luggage to keep your hands free for lifting (and/or holding your navigational device...).</li>
<li>even wheeled luggage will have to be physically lifted to cross bridges</li>
<li>good rubberized wheels will minimize noise in the streets (it is <i>very</i> annoying to be woken at all times because of noisy luggage being dragged)</li>
<li>some accomodation (apartments, B&amp;B, etc.) might only be accessible via narrow, steep and worn-out stairs (if in doubt, do check with your hosts beforehand).</li></ul>
<p>Consider this when choosing your location and route to it.
</p><p><b>Remember</b> <i>that all water transport might be affected by or even suspended</i> because of high water, fog or ice. Plan ahead and check options with your hosts.<br />(even an unusually high tide might prevent boats from passing underneath some bridges, causing detours.)

<ul><li>overnight stays
<ul><li>from 1,50 to 5 EUR per night for the first five nights</li>

<p>Venice is served by three airports: 
</p>

<p>The closest commercial airport is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://veniceairport.it/en/">Marco Polo Airport</a>  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>VCE</b>), on the mainland near <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a> (technically part of the city of Venice but on the mainland and without Venice's unique structure). The official airport website has a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.veniceairport.it/en/transport.html">transportation information page</a>. 
</p><p><b>Note:</b> Marco Polo is currently (2018) undergoing major renovations and upgrading. Layouts, routings and available facilities might change quickly.
</p><p><b>Tip:</b> VCE is usually approached from the south, giving you a nice view of Venice from the right hand window seats.
</p><p>You have a number of travel options from here:
</p>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.atvo.it/index.php?lang=en&amp;area=23&amp;menuid=35"><b>ATVO Venezia Express:</b></a> direct non-stop to Piazzale Roma is a coach-type bus with seperate luggage compartment and guaranteed seating (10-15 Minutes). As of April 2018, the ticket costs €8 one way, €15 return. From Piazzale Roma, it is possible to catch the vaporreto to other water stops in Venice, see getting around section.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.actv.it/en/movingmainland/urbanlines"><b>local bus ACTV line 5:</b></a> all local stops to Piazzale Roma with mixed standing and seating space. As of April 2018, the ticket costs €8 one way, €15 return and the journey takes around 20-25 Minutes. It might be awkward with luggage, especially for groups.</li>
<li><b>by rail (via bus):</b> ATVO also operates <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.atvo.it/index.php?lingua=en&amp;area=menustandard&amp;idpadre=23&amp;idmenu=35"><b>ATVO MESTRE Express</b></a> buses to the Mestre train and bus station for €8 (2019), convenient for connections to <a href="/en/Milan" title="Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="/en/Padova" title="Padova">Padova</a>, <a href="/en/Trieste" title="Trieste">Trieste</a>, <a href="/en/Verona" title="Verona">Verona</a>, and the rest of Italy and surrounding countries. Tickets can be purchased in the baggage claim area, the airport bus stop, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://88.36.245.11/webticketing/index.jsp?lang=en">online</a>. Timetables through March 2019 are <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.atvo.it/allegati/aeroporti/linea_35_b_-_mestre_fs-m.polo_dal_28.10.18_al_30.03.19.pdf">here</a>. Non-express city buses also go to the railway station of Venice Santa Lucia (5 minutes' walk from Piazzale Roma); and to the bus terminal of Piazzale Roma. Considering the time and effort for an extra transfer, taking a bus the whole way would usually be the better option.</li>
<li><b>by bus:</b> In addition to the ATVO city buses to Venice and Mestre, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://shop.global.flixbus.com/search?departureCity=23238">FlixBus</a> operates routes to other cities in northern Italy and surrounding countries such as Slovenia and Croatia.</li>
<li><b>by intercity shuttle:</b> A company named <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.goopti.com/en/">GoOpti</a> offers shared or private shuttle services between Venice airport and surrounding cities in Italy and Slovenia. Pricing is dynamic and cheaper when booked earlier. Shared pricing to Trieste and Koper is often in the range of €25-50 as of 2019.</li>
<li><b>by (road) taxi:</b> You can always take a taxi outside the arrivals hall past the bus stops. All Venice taxis charge the same of €35-45 (2019) for the short rides to or from Marco Polo depending on your destination zone. Every other option is better unless you have a specific need for a taxi.</li></ul>
<p><b>Bus stops</b> are across the hall as you exit from customs, outside the building (covered).
</p>
<ul><li><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.alilaguna.it/en"><b>Alilaguna</b></a>: this boat shuttle has regular services into Venice, check the lines to find the stop nearest your destination.<br />This is convenient if you have to carry a lot of luggage and/or want to avoid transfers at Piazzale Roma or between vaporetto lines. The boat shuttle is a good option to connect to very early or late flights.<br /><b>However:</b> It might be cramped at peak times and the enclosed compartment does not give any views. Beware that you may not be able to board if the boat is full, especially on the return trip to the airport.<br />As of April 2018, the ticket costs €15 one way, €27 return. Tickets can be bought in advance, but do not guarantee a seat.</li></ul>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Ticket vending machines for the bus and Alilaguna services and AVTO express buses are located in the baggage reclaim area. Good use for idle time while you still have your hands free.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Water taxi</b>: (also: 'private boat', 'speed boat') is the very scenic, most comfortable and expensive way (EUR 120 per trip / EUR 35 shared, depart-when-full) to arrive directly at your hotel in Venice, to Venice Cruise Port terminal and to Lido di Venezia (a big island in front of Venice).<br />Tickets can be bought to the left across the hall as you exit from customs. Look for the blue 'Speed boat' signs.<br />This would be your best option if you travel at unusual hours or have to handle more luggage then you can conveniently carry and it will minimize walking across bridges.<br />Depending on the kind of service requested (meet &amp; greet, luggage assistance, minivan transfer or simply water taxi) the price can run from €100 to €160 (4 people with luggage) from Marco Polo Airport to Venice City Centre or to the Cruise Port Terminal. Every additional passenger costs €10-20 up to the maximum of 10 people.<br /> Be aware that the ride can be rocky when crossing the wake of oncoming craft. Always hold on tight when standing. You might also get sprayed with salt water when standing at the open roof.</li></ul>
<p><b>All boat departures</b> are 10-15 minutes' covered walk with moving walkways from Marco Polo airport. Exit the arrivals hall towards the bus stop, take an elevator up to departure level, turn to your left along the walkway. Here you will find free trolleys to carry luggage for the short trip to the water taxi departure point. There are also some companies that offer porter services and/or private minivan transfer from the airport to the water taxi departure point.

From Treviso Airport to Venice and Mestre, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.barziservice.com/en/services/airport/">Barzi Bus Service</a> offers a €22 (<i>Oct 2016</i>) round-trip ticket price to Venice. There is a counter at the airport selling these tickets, and they are also available for purchase on the buses. Barzi services unfortunately terminate at the less convenient Tronchetto parking island, where you need to take the "people mover" service to connect to Piazzale Roma (the main bus terminal) - or the train from Mestre. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.atvo.it/en-treviso-airport.html">ATVO</a> offer a service for the same price (€22 round-trip or €12 one way) which terminates at the more convenient Piazzale Roma.

<p>The <b>San Nicolo Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>ATC</b>) is an airfield directly on the Lido. It handles only small aircraft, as the runway is grass and only about 1km long. It does not have any scheduled flights, but might be of interest to private pilots (arrivals from <a href="/en/Schengen" title="Schengen">Schengen</a> states only) due to its convenience to the city; it is only a short walk to the vaporetto landing.

<p>Cruise ships and smaller boats arrive at the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.vtp.it/"><b>Stazione Marittima</b></a> which is at the west end of the main islands.  The cruise and ferry terminals (see map<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vtp.it/operatori/crociere.jsp">[2]</a>) can be reached from Piazzale Roma by:
</p>
<ul><li>People Mover<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.avmspa.it/context.jsp?ID_LINK=22&amp;area=8">[3]</a> (3 minutes trip). This new (2010) public transportation system, an automated land funicular operating from 7 AM to 11 PM Mon-Sat (check website for Sun/holidays) every 8 minutes, allows you to reach Piazzale Roma in less than 3 minutes (€ 1.30 pp). A shuttle bus service is available to connect the various terminals with the People Mover stop at Marittima.</li>
<li>Taxi cab (about 2 minutes trip).</li></ul>
<p>The cruise port is also served by vaporetti and water taxis.
</p><p>Turn left on leaving the terminal and walk 10 minutes along the covered walkway to the boat jetty. Alilaguna water-bus costs €15 for a 75 minute boat trip. Murano costs €8 and takes only half an hour. There are three Alilaguna routes to different areas of Venice. A direct waterbus from the airport may be be more convenient than taking the bus to the bus station and then changing to the local waterbus. The waterbus services that run to the airport are operated by a different company (Alilaguna) than the other public waterbus services in Venice, so separate tickets will be required. Also note that the water-buses are of limited capacity, so you might end up waiting an additional 30 minutes for the next boat. Alternatively, from the same jetty, you can travel in style (and much faster) by hiring one of the speedy water-taxis (30min) for about €110. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.alilaguna.it/en/lines/lines-map">Waterbus route map</a>.
</p><p>If you're in nearby sea resorts such as <a href="/en/Cavallino_-_Treporti" title="Cavallino - Treporti">Cavallino</a> or <a href="/en/Jesolo" title="Jesolo">Jesolo</a>, one easy way to get to Venice is the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://actv.avmspa.it/en/content/orari-servizio-di-navigazione-0">ACTV</a> boat service departing from <b>Punta Sabbioni</b> or <a href="/en/Cavallino_-_Treporti" title="Cavallino - Treporti">Treporti</a> (lines 14 and 15). There are boats every 30 minutes or so, they go around the Lagoon stopping at <a href="/en/Lido" title="Lido">Lido</a> and Venice very close to St Mark's Square. Some routes also stop in the islands of <a href="/en/Burano" title="Burano">Burano</a>, <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a>, and <a href="/en/Torcello" title="Torcello">Torcello</a>.

<p>Trains from the mainland run through <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a> to the <b>Venezia Santa Lucia</b> train station on the west side of Venice; make sure you don't get confused with <b>Venezia Mestre</b> which is the last stop on the mainland. From the station district, water buses (<i>vaporetti</i>), water taxis or a walk can take you to hotels or other locations on the islands.

<p>Cars arrive on the far western edge of Venice, but remain parked at the entrance to the city (Piazzale Roma or Tronchetto - Europe's largest car park.) There are no roads past this point -- and never were, even before cars. Car parking is very very expensive here (€26/12h, €30/24h) and the tailbacks can be quite large. An alternative is to use the car parks on the mainland (terra ferma) and catch a train or bus or vaporetto into Venice. Park near the <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a> railway station, and catch a train to Venezia St.Lucia; there are many trains, it is very near (8-10 minutes) and quite cheap (€ 1,20). Don't bother searching for free parking near Mestre train station - there are no free parking spots near, except on Sunday (free parking is on the other side of the station, in Marghera). Free and safe parking spots can also be found near the Mogliano Veneto and Oriago railway stations. Besides, Venezia St. Lucia is a good starting point to visit Venice. However, drivers going to the Lido can use the car ferry from Tronchetto (vaporetto 17 - frequencies vary), right hand lane off the Ponte della Libertà into the city.
Another place for free parking in Mestre is the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.mestre.it/pages/contenuti/index.php?content_id=55">council car park</a>.
Those with "Gratuito" are parking lots which are totally free. Many have bus stops right next to them, and many of those buses go directly to Venice without any transfers.

<p>Most of the major rental car companies have outlets at Piazzale Roma, at the edge of the city. These are on the ground floor of one of the major parking stations. When you are dropping off your car, you need to find street parking and then walk to the rental car outlet and hand in the keys. Do not park in the parking station! There is a vaporetto stop across the road from the parking station.

<p>There is a direct bus between Marco Polo airport, Canova (Treviso) airport and the Piazzale Roma, on the west bank of Venice operated by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.atvo.it/index.php?lang=en&amp;area=23&amp;menuid=35">ATVO</a>. Starts twice an hour, takes 20 minutes and costs €9 one way and €15 for a round trip. From the Treviso Airport, the price is €12 one way and €22 for a round trip. If you travel from Treviso airport, ask locals to share fuel to Mestre Station of Venezia Piazzale Roma, or take the local bus to the Treviso train station, and then a train from there.
</p><p>The buses run from the airport until about midnight but stop sooner on the Venice to Airport route. There are also frequent buses that run from Canova airport (Treviso) and take about 25 minutes to reach Piazzale Roma, which is the main bus station in Venice. From Piazzale Roma, you can easily connect to the place you need to be, by bus, but also if you need to get a train, Santa Lucia train station is just over the bridge about a 5 minute walk ( note that it can be quite tiring walking over that bridge if you have big suitcases and although there isn't a ramp (don't know why), there are wider steps that are not as harsh as the main steps to walk up. There is also a wheelchair stair lift for those requiring it.
</p><p>From <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a>, you can take a bus to Venice - Piazzale Roma. The ticket costs €2.50 round trip and you must buy bus tickets from specialized ticket kiosks and vending machines, as well as tobacconists and news stands.
</p><p>(Please note that the ticket prices tend to increase from year to year and may have changed since this article was updated.)

<p>Cycling in Venice itself is not possible and since 2016 bikes are not permitted in town, neither if hand-carried, although there are few allowed areas (Railway station, piazzale Roma and Tronchetto). Leaving your bike behind on the mainland may be the best option to choose. Near the Venezia Mestre train station there is a guarded bike parking facility, called Bici Park Mestre. Take the exit from the station on the Via Trento side (north), and turn left. The Bici Park is a few hundred meters down the road. Opening hours are 06:00 to 23:00 on weekdays and Saturday; the facility is closed on Sundays, so plan ahead. The cost is €0.50 per bike per day (partial days are counted as full days). (Up to date as of March 2017.)
</p><p>Parking bikes in Venice proper is also an option. It's not signposted anywhere, but the Tronchetto parking garage near the Venezia Santa Lucia train station has a back room where bikes can be securely parked. Ask at the ticket counter at the far (southern) end of the garage. The cost is €4 per bike per day (where a day is 24h). (Up to date as of March 2017.)
</p><p>To get your bike into Venice proper, you have several options:
</p>
<ul><li>Ride your bike across the bridge. On the right hand side of the bridge into Venice is a cycle/pedestrian path, separated from motorized traffic. This path is simple to get to, as long as you don't mind cycling alongside heavy traffic on the SR11.</li>
<li>Take your bike on the train from Venezia Mestre station to Venezia Santa Lucia station.</li></ul>

<p>Venice, the world's only pedestrian city, is easily walkable, and the absence of cars makes this a particularly pleasant experience. However, walking and standing all day can also be exhausting, so it is best to pace yourself. The Rialtine islands - the 'main' part of Venice - are small enough to walk from one end to the other in about an hour, provided you don't get lost (a common occurrence).
</p><p>The area is -apart from going up and down the bridges- very level. Wheeled objects will not start moving of their own. Wind, however, might be a different thing.
</p><p>All transport involves either walking or boats.
</p><p>Bear in mind that most canals do not have any sort of railing and that tourist crowds might make progress <i>very</i> tedious at times.

<p>Apart from the Lido (the island separating the lagoon from the Adriatic sea) and Sant'Erasmo, there are no roads after Piazzale Roma.
</p><p>There are regular ferry services to the Lido to get your vehicle across (which is time consuming, so consider this carefully). Best check with your hosts, to evaluate this option.

<p>If you want to get around a bit more quickly, there are numerous <b>vaporetti (water buses, sing.: vaporetto)</b> serving the Canal Grande, the larger canals through Venice and the surrounding islands (Lido, La Guidecca, Murano, Burano, and so on).
</p><p>The vaporetti are generally the best way to get around for longer trips or for crossing the Canal Grande away from the bridges. Lines 1 and 2 go all the way along the Canal Grande and offer an easy sightseeing trip.
</p><p>Some routes may change by the season and depend on weather and tide conditions.
</p><p>Be aware that:
</p>
<ul><li>departure screens do not necessarily show all services - for example the airport boats are not shown (presumably because they are privately operated)</li>
<li>departure screens do not show which pier a boat departs from, only the next departure for each line avaialable. Therefore you will need to find separate signs to locate the correct pier.</li>
<li>when finding the pier, double check the direction of travel rather than relying on the destination - this is because some lines (e.g. 5.1) are circular, so the destination will be 'Lido' regardless of the direction.</li>
<li>when on the boat, stops are not announced and there are no displays on board, so pay attention to avoid missing your stop.</li>
<li>in some cases, the time between Vaporetto services can be 20-30 minutes, so it's worth planning ahead if you need to arrive punctually (e.g. for the airport).</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tickets">Tickets</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Venice&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30" title="Edit section: Tickets">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.actv.it/en"><b>ACTV</b></a> runs the vaporetti and other public transport services both in the lagoon and on <i>terra firma</i>. Travel cards are extremely useful since the basic fare for one vaporetto journey is typically €9.50 (valid 75 min, as of Feb 2023). There are other versions available, including those offering discounts for youths under 29. 
The vaporetti uses an honour system, meaning you are expected to validate your ticket at the stop before boarding. Be aware that Vaporetto stops do not always have ticket machines or ticket offices, and when they do, queues can be long to buy tickets.
</p><p>Since 2009 the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://veniceconnected.com">Venice Connected website</a> of the Comune di Venezia makes possible to book online (at least 7 days in advance) most services controlled by the town administration (public transportation, access to the civic museums, access to public restrooms, car park tickets, entrance to the Casinò and access to the municipal Wi-Fi network covering the entire historic centre); the online prices vary according to the projected number of visitors but are always cheaper than the current on-site prices (and cheaper than with a Venice Card).
</p><p>You can also get a Venice Card, which has various options that you can choose when you buy it (public transportation, cultural attractions, toilet access, Alilaguna, etc.) There is a 'Junior' version of the Venice that is available at a slightly reduced rate for those between 5 and 29 years of age. Note, however, that a Venice Card is not recommended for those with less than 3 days in Venice, as most of the top attractions are not included in the Venice Card. If you'll be staying in Venice for a week - get the Venice Card and enjoy travelling from island to island and exploring the various museums and churches it offers access to. 
</p><p>Maps are available at the vaporetto stops in the ticket booths. The map is quite reliable, and is free when getting a Venice Card ( €2 otherwise), or view the map <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.venice.nu/">here</a>.
</p><p>Venice Cards can be reserved on-line for a considerable discount <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.hellovenezia.com/index.php?lang=en">here</a>. Keep in mind, though, that there are long lines when taking the Venice Card from the ticket booths. The Venezia St. Lucia ticket booth that offers Venice Cards is the one most on the right when you exit the train station.
</p><p>Another all inclusive option is the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.turbopass.com/venice-city-pass"><b>Venice City Pass</b></a> which features free access to Venice’s top sights and museums, a canal tour as well as a free airport shuttle and a practical travel guide. The amount of sights included depends on the version (Starter, Classic and Best) with Best covering the highest amount of attractions. All three available options include highlights such as St.Mark's Basilica, Doge's Palace (with fast track entry), Scuola San Rocco and many more. All are valid for seven consecutive days from a chosen start date. An optional travelcard can be added to the Venice City Pass.

<p>Vaporettos can be crowded at times, so space is at a premium.<br />
Also, getting on and off involves staff handling the mooring lines and operating the gates.
</p><p>So please
</p>
<ul><li>keep the exits clear</li>
<li>take off your bulky backpack as it consumes extra space and might end up in somebodys face when you excitedly turn around for some sight.</li>
<li>place your luggage out of they way of doors. Use the luggage space provided.</li>
<li>be considerate of people needing assistance</li>
<li>observe the separate entry and exit lanes at stops</li>
<li>always let people get off first and wait for staff to signal for boarding</li></ul>

<p>Water taxis are the most flexible and most expensive travel option in Venice. They operate at all times and offer the closest access from/to your destination.
</p><p>Prices inside Venice start from around 40-50 EUR (which will bring you a distance that is also easily walked) and depend on distance and time of day.<br />
Boats hold up to ten persons including luggage (with a surcharge from the 7th person).<br />
They can also be hired for special trips, such as individual sightseeing.
</p><p>However, 
</p>
<ul><li>not all canals are navigable by water taxis (if in doubt, check with your hosts beforehand)</li>
<li>depending on the kind of landing and tides, you might have to negotiate (up- or down-) differences in levels between the landing and boat of 30cm / 1 foot or more or uneven and often slippery steps</li>
<li>the boat will be wobbly, unaccustomed persons or those with limited abilities will need a hand</li>
<li>boat captains must remain on their craft at all times, so they cannot give you a hand with luggage outside their boat</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_gondola">By gondola</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Venice&amp;action=edit&amp;section=33" title="Edit section: By gondola">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>These days, gondolas are mostly used for scenic purposes instead of actual transport from point A to point B.<br />
There are many stops dotted around the areas frequented by tourists and they are readily obvious, even when the gondolieri dress in something warmer then straw boaters and striped tops.<br />
(Daytime) Prices start at around 80 EUR for 30 minutes and gondolas comfortably take 4 people, with a maximum of 6. Seated only, with some seats facing backwards.<br />
Special arrangements can be made to serve your interests (special routes, photo shoots, etc.).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_traghetto">By traghetto</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Venice&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34" title="Edit section: By traghetto">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The traghetto is the cheapest way to cross the Grand Canal without using the bridges. These are public shared gondolas operated by two gondolieri and are a lot cheaper than paying €80 for a private one. It costs only 2 Euros per person (Note. According to some 2022 Travel books it is now up to €5) (cash only, preferably coins!) for tourists (70 cents for locals) - you can then say you went in a gondola, even if it was only for a couple of minutes! There are 7 piers for traghetti along the canal. Simply look for straight lines across the canal in the map, or follow the "traghetto" signs. Bear in mind that you are expected to stand, especially when it's crowded and that luggage is usually not taken on.
</p><p>Note that vaporetti at some stops offer special traghetto-tickets giving you a one-stop hop across the Canal Grande at 2 EUR instead of 7 EUR for a regular single ticket.

<p>This is definitely the best way to experience Venice.
</p><p>Venice itself is not a large city. Most destinations across the city can be reached within 20 minutes of walking, <i>if</i> you know your way and can stay clear of tourist congestions.<br />
This beats most transport by boats.
</p><p>Unless you are pressed for time, just start walking and let yourself get lost in the maze of alleys that is Venice. In time, you will always come across a familiar landmark or to a vaporetto stop to regain your bearings.<br />
Along the way you will discover marvelous art, superb architecture and breathtaking urban landscaping as well as bars, cafes and restaurants to soak up the local atmosphere and rest your weary feet. 
</p><p>Major destinations, like Piazza San Marco, Rialto, Ferrovia (train station) or Piazzale Roma (bus terminal) are marked by arrows put up on the walls.
</p><p>Be aware that addresses in Venice are of the form DISTRICT number (The Venetian word for district is "Sestiere"), not STREET number. To find a specific place using a map, make sure you know which district it is in. The numbers are assigned at the start of the district and increase as they move farther away from the Grand Canal. If possible, get detailed descriptions for your accomodation in advance, as doubling back across bridges with luggage in tow is quite bothersome.
</p><p>For a day visit to Venice, there are two left luggage options near st Lucia station. On the end platform, near the toilets, left luggage will cost €6 per bag, per day or €12 for the "express" service. The express service allows you to skip the, often very long, lines that occur. There is additionally a small store outside the station near the main bridge offering a cheaper option at €5.

The bridge has become one of Venice's most recognizable icons and has a history that spans over 800 years.  Today's Rialto Bridge was completed in 1591 and was used to replace a wooden bridge that collapsed in 1524. This bridge alone required over 6.000 trees for each foundation.</li>

The area was extended from 1546 by the (confusingly named) "old foundry" (Ghetto Vecchio). Today, Jewish life is still very active in the ghetto, and elsewhere in Venice, and is home to five synagogues built by the Jewish communities roughly grouped by their arrival in Venice (Italian, Ashkenazi, Sephardim and Levantine).  On late Fridays and Saturdays Jewish places will be closed in observence of Shabbath. If you wish to sense the unique Venetian atmosphere coming from the East you can take part in an itinerary covering the Jewish Ghetto and the Rialto area to discover the crucible of ethnicities, cultures and religions that have co-existed for centuries in Venice and admire a different side of this city.</span> </span></li></ul>

<p>Although the Basilica di San Marco is free, other famous churches charge an entry fee. If you plan to visit three churches or more,  you are better off buying the churches pass. There is also a combined pass for museums, churches and transportation only available at the tourist information office but it is relatively expensive.<br />Remember that churches are active religious centres. Entry for sightseeing might be restricted at times and you are expected to be respectful of their rules (which often includes a no-photo / no-video clause).

As with most churches in Italy, you must be dressed appropriately to be allowed in; this means no short skirts or bare shoulders.  You are not allowed to carry large bags or rucksacks inside. You must deposit them just round the corner from the main entrance. Filming and photography is forbidden so be prepared in advance.  The visit within the basilica lasts ten minutes. Waiting for entry into the basilica can last up to five or so hours and it may be wise to buy a "cut the line" ticket from the official site <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.venetoinside.com/en/saint_mark_s_basilica/">[1]</a> for €5 (as of Feb 2023). Once you have a reservation you can take the group entrance on the left, where you give in the printout of your reservation. These reservations are only available 7 months out of the year, 1 Apr-31 Oct. The symbol of St. Mark’s Basilica is a masterpiece of the Greek Hellenistic sculpture: the famous <b>gilded bronze horses</b>.  A visit to St Mark’s Basilica is a must! It is renowned worldwide for its priceless treasures and fascinating secret places. Some of them, such as the Baptistery and the Zen Chapel, are usually closed to the public.</span> <span class="price">Admission to the basilica is €3 (as of Feb 2023); however, the museum upstairs costs €7 and to view the high altar and treasury costs €5</span>. </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>San Giacomo di Rialto</b>. This church is possibly the oldest church in Venice built around 421. It is most recognized for its 15th century clock above the entrance of the church. It is also recognized for the red pillars and beautiful gold accents around the church itself.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>San Giovanni e Paolo</b> (<b>San Zanipolo</b> in Venetian dialect). A fine, huge Dominican church with the tombs of many Doges. It shares its piazza with the fine Renaissance facade of the Scuola San Marco and an equestrian statue of the mercenary (condottiere) captain Colleone. Look out for the testicles (coglioni in Italian - it's a lousy pun) on his coat of arms!</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari</b>. The big friary church, with fine monuments and paintings, among which the famous 'Assunta' by Titian. Regular tickets: €3,00</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Santa Maria dei Miracoli</b>. A perfect jewel box church, simple in form but ornamented with fine exterior marble facings.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>San Simeone Piccolo</b>. The last church built in Venice. It is located across from the Grand Canal in front of Santa Lucia Train station. One of the things that it is recognized for is the fact that they celebrate Tridentine Mass on Sundays. It is also recognized for it's dome because it is used to make the church look taller than it is and the dome itself is entirely covered with lead sheet.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta in Torcello</b> is situated in the charming <a href="/en/Torcello" title="Torcello">Torcello</a> island, and it is an enchanting example of Venetian- Byzantine architecture. The cathedral is renowned for its important mosaics, which are a real masterpiece of the Byzantine-Ravennate school, including that in the counter-façade representing the Last Judgment. Discover, among its historical and artistic treasures, some exclusive areas which have remained inaccessible for centuries: the crypt and the sacristy. The crypt is situated under the altar and, being frequently reached by the water, is equipped with a wooden bridge in order to make visits always available. The other mysterious location that has been covered for centuries is the sacristy. Following a hidden passageway,  you can reach a Roman sarcophagus, which is supposed to have been the tomb of Mark the Evangelist for a period of time, when the Basilica in Venice wasn’t built yet.</li></ul>

<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Ferry_ride"><span class="fn org">Ferry ride</span> (<span class="nickname">traghetto</span>). <span class="description">If a gondola seems a little pricey,  the alternative to cross the Grand Canal by traghetto is much more cheaper. They are stripped down and used as municipal ferries. In the 1950's there were as many as thirty, but now there are seven points to find them. However some only operate when people are going to and from work. The length of any crossing is just a few minutes. Many visitors enjoy visiting the open air markets near the Rialto Bridge and there is a traghetto station there, at the <b>Pescheria</b> (fish market) joining the Santa Sophia church along the Strada Nova. You will notice that traghetti passengers tend to stand up, but if you are not comfortable doing so, sitting is possible, if you are careful. To be more adventurous, you can try the venetian rowing style through "Row Venice" area or one of the many rowing clubs. Take of your backpack before getting on and while on board as it inhibits your balance and might hit others when making sudden moves.</span> </span></li>
<li><span class="vcard" id="Gondola_ride"><span class="fn org">Gondola ride</span>. <span class="description">Take a <b>Gondola</b> if you can afford it: it's expensive, but the <i>Gondoliere</i> may decrease the price if you ask (but they can also decrease the time...). Make sure you reach an agreement on price and time before you start!  A good tip with the Gondolieres is to bargain the price down as low as you can, then say that it's still too much and walk away.  Two or three of them will chase after you, one after the other, each offering a lower price than the last. It's possible to knock €20-€30 off the price(even then, be prepared to shell out €80). Gondola rides are always costly, often in a princely way and that expense should be planned in advance of the visit. If you go as a group it might be cheaper, though the number of people who can be accommodated on a gondola varies, usually up to a maximum of six seated passengers. The "traghetti" holds more, mostly standing, as a pair of gondoliers rows short distances for canal crossing purposes at a number of points along the Grand Canal. All gondoliers must be male and most are born locals. There are only a few Germans in the business and a single lady, Alexandra Hai, who couldn't manage a for-hire license even after 10 years. She is officially allowed to carry guests of their contract hotel only.</span> </span></li>
<li><span class="vcard" id="Water_Bus_ride"><span class="fn org">Water Bus ride</span>. <span class="description">Ride a <b>Vaporetto</b> down the Grand Canal right before sunset. The Vaporettos are not cheap, but the sights are priceless: amazing architecture, soft seaside sunlight, and a fascinating parade of Venetian watercraft.</span> </span></li>
<li><span class="vcard" id="Water_taxi"><span class="fn org">Water taxi</span>. <span class="description">While going through Venice, make sure you take in the beauty of it all. Walk through the alley ways or take the water taxi to different parts of the island, sometimes at night you can just go sit in an open area and watch locals and tourists passing by. It is wonderful. There are many museums and churches that are around the city that allow tourists to go in a visit. They are many great sights to keep you busy throughout your visit.</span> </span></li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Carnival of Venice</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.carnevale.venezia.it/en">[5]</a> is one of the most popular carnivals of the world. First organised in 1926, it has been rivived from the 1980s to become a major destination for people wearing masks and costumes from any kind of era. 'Traditional' (i.e. pre-19th century styles) can be seen right next to anything that takes your fancy, be it self-styled dresses, steampunk or outfits modeled on fiction or manga templates. The original fascination of carneval came from people being hidden behind their masks, allowing them to cross social boundaries and disregard social norms for some time.</li>
<li><b>Festa del Redentore</b> (Feast of the Redeemer) is held on the third Sunday of July. It commemorates the end of the plague in Venice in 1577. The feast is mostly known for the fireworks display which begins on Saturday night at 10pm which is admired by thousand of Venetians from their boats in St. Mark basin or from their terraces. After the display, which lasts about 40 minutes, the young people of Venice head to the Lido to wait for dawn. Three regattas are held on Sunday. Religious celebrations are held in the Church of the Holy Redeemr on Saturday at 7:30 pm and on Sunday at 12:30 am and 8 am.</li>
<li><b>La Biennale di Venezia</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.labiennale.org/en/">[6]</a> is one of the most well known culture institutions. Two events organised by Biennale are the Art and Architecture International Exhibitions happening alternately (Architecture Biennale in even years, Art Biennale in odd) but other fields are also covered - contemporary theatre, dance, music, cinema. Biennale Architecture 2021 edition from May 22th to November 21st.</li>
<li><b>Regata 'Storica</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://regatastoricavenezia.it/?lang=en&amp;pg=1&amp;page=1">[7]</a> (Historic fleet event) is held on the first Sunday of every September. Celebrating a historic event from 1489, the regatta displays almost a hundred varieties of venetian boats from the city's rich past. Large oarships, replicating ancient roman and medieval vessels, are rowed along the Canal Grande, followed by many smaller boats. There are several races, including a master championship for solo sculling in streamlined gondolini, painted in unusual white, pink, etc. colours. There are many excellent photo opportunities for this event.</li>
<li><b>Venice International Film Festival</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/">[8]</a> - 78th edition, from 1st to 11th September 2021, will take place as usual in the island of Lido di Venezia. This is the oldest film festival of the world. Screenings will take place at Palazzo del Cinema on Lungomare Marconi and other nearby places such as the Venice Casino.</li>
<li><b>Voga Longa</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vogalonga.it/">[9]</a>, the yearly equivalent of a marathon run on water. Voga Longa competitors must row 32 kilometers under 3.5 hours to receive a certificate of attendance at the finish line, but everybody with a human-powered vessel is welcome to participate (some foreigner teams take up to 10 hours to complete the journey just for the fun of it). The official purpose of the Voga Longa was to protest the sharply increasing use of powerboats in Venice, but the event has gradually grown into a festival since 1974, with up to 5500 racers in 1500 vessels attending by the early 2000s. The racetrack visits different parts of Venice as well as some of the nearby islands. Locals and tourists lining up alongside rios and canals cheer the racers. Visitors wishing to participate should have serious experience in rowing or sculling and practice duely, as the journey is physically demanding (even seasoned oarsmen develop calluses by the finish line). The event is mainly for teams, completing Voga Longa on a single oar is considered a major achievement. Extreme participation (scuba frogmen and surface swimmers) sometimes occurs, but it is not recommended due to water contamination issues.</li></ul>

<p>If you are looking for something to do, you can always shop. Venice is packed full of little stores in every corner and crevice. The commonest local specialties are Carnival masks, glass, and marbled paper.  Price can vary wildly, so it's a good idea to hold off buying until you have a fair idea about the relative value of things. As is the case with most tourist cities, a LOT of the "original " and "made in Venice" items are actually made in China. <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> is an island famous for its glass making. Almost in every shop you will find "original <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> glass" items. If it was really made in <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a>, it would be prohibitively expensive, with prices routinely running into thousands of euros. So if you are looking for cheap souvenirs, real <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> glass is not the thing to buy! You can also see glass making demonstrations in <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a>, but be sure to check that there is a demonstration scheduled for that day. And it is normally not done in winter either. 
</p><p>Venice has always been a city of merchants. Consequently, most of the Venetians working in Venice still own or work at a shop. If the pride of the Republic of Venice was the extreme diversity and quality of goods and services which could be found in Venice, these days, however, mass tourism led Venice to be populated with many shops selling low-quality souvenirs. The local shops are suffering a lot from this situation and it is not easy to identify them within the crowd of shops selling harmful imported goods.
</p><p>Shops generally open around 10am and stay open at least until 7pm, sometimes later, depending on proximity to tourist haunts. Some shops (especially in the more out-of-the-way-areas might close from noon to 2pm.
</p><p>Those wishing for more affordable fare can find it at low-end trinket stores and mid-market boutiques scattered here and there throughout the city. At the <i>Rialto Market,</i> for example, you can find relatively cheap T-shirts and toy plastic gondolas. Most of the shops of Venice, however, specialize in local artisan products, big-names Italian fashion and everything “boutique.”
</p><p>Be careful when buying fake luxury products from people spreading their wares on the pavement (especially handbags, sunglases and the like). Apart from damaging the industry, such low-quality items may be confiscated at customs and you may be liable to a fine.
</p><p>Some of the best and most famous of Venetian shopping opportunities, according to the categories of their wares, are listed below for your convenience:
</p>
<ul><li>For <b>Antiques,</b> try the triannual <b>Mercatino dell'Antiquariato</b> if you are in town in early June, mid-September or late December. There are over 100 vendors, and you will find a great variety of unique antiquarian products.</li></ul>
<ul><li>For <b>leather goods,</b> visit <b>ruga Rialto,</b> where you will find locally crafted leather bags or <b>Fanny</b> on Calle dei Saoneri for leather gloves in a multitude of colors and styles.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you are looking for Venetian <b>shoes,</b> try <b>Bruno Magli,</b> <b>Mori e Bozzi</b> or <b>Rolando Segalin.</b> The first two have large assortments of high quality footwear, while the last-mentioned shop is famous for its creatively designed <i>Carnevale</i> shoes.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you need a <b>high-end scarf or shawl,</b> look for <b>Venetia Studium.</b> You will find velvet and silken scarves, shawls, pillows and evening bags that are delicately woven to perfection.</li></ul>
<ul><li>For <b>jewelry,</b> visit <b>Jewelry Chimento,</b> where you will find both custom-made and top international designs in the highest quality gold and silver.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Antichita Zaggia</b> specializes in both <b>antique jewelry and glassware,</b> and their products are truly works of art. Similarly, <b>Esperienze</b> makes its own pins and necklaces from traditionally blown glass.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Venini</b> is the most respected glass maker in all Venice, and you can see their creations on display at the <i>Marco Polo.</i> Also don't miss the <b>antique Venetian Pearls,</b> a kind of glass bead, for sale at <b>Anticlea Antiquariato.</b></li></ul>
<ul><li>For <b>crafts and general artisan products,</b> explore the <b>Murano Art Shop.</b> Local artisans fill it with masks, puppets, music boxes and more — both the traditional and the contemporary.</li></ul>
<ul><li>For <b>Venetian masks and costumes,</b> stop by the <b>Atelier Marega.</b> You will also find there exquisite chandeliers, masks, more Venetian glass jewelry and other crafts.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Try any of the several <b>Biblos</b> locations for leather journals, classy fountain pens, specialty papers and unique artistic treasures.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Libreria_Acqua_Alta"><span class="fn org">Libreria Acqua Alta</span>, <span class="adr"><span class="street-address">Calle Longa Santa Maria Formosa | 5176 - Castello</span></span>, <a class="url external autonumber" href="https://www.facebook.com/libreriaacquaalta/" rel="nofollow">[x]</a>. <span class="description">One of the most beautiful bookshops in the world. You will find thousands of books (mostly in Italian, but it is worth to look for other languages) stored in racks or bathtubs and gondolas (to protect them from the occasional flooding). A must see.</span> </span></li></ul>
<p>If you've come to Venice thinking that you won't be able to do a bit of designer shopping, think again! Just like in every major Italian city, you get the big fashion brand names here too. For label clothing shopping, the best area is that around the Piazza San Marco, where you can find Versace, MaxMara, Gucci, Armani, Louis Vuitton, Prada (and numerous more) big names. If you want to shop for clothing or accessories, though, you don't necessarily have to shop through the biggest names in fashion - in the Campo Santo Stefano and Calle della Mandola, you can get less famous or local boutiques, but you can find some excellent quality and/or unique items such as clothes, shoes, wallets, or handbags.
</p><p>Watch out also for the hand-made paper and the exquisite miniature buildings made by Moro. Watch out for fakes; Moro "signs" his name on the back. Also, beware of fakes and "free" trips to neighboring <a href="/en/Murano" title="Murano">Murano</a> for its famous glass. (See article for details.)
</p><p>Tourist Traps: "Coloured Pasta" and "Venetian Limoncello" (not the original napolitan one) are not Italian food, no Italian would ever eat them, they are particularly made for tourists, only buy typical regional Italian food in food shops and always check the labels to discover where they have been made. In case it is not stated on the label, avoid the purchase.

<p>Venice has some wonderful restaurants, featuring the cuisine of the Veneto. However it is widely regarded that the restaurants in Venice serve food of a quality and in quantities much lower than anywhere else in Italy. The pizza in Venice is well known as being the worst in Italy (It is a more southern italian speciality). For Americans, you can find a place called Quanto Basta pizza that serves an American-style pizza with pepperoni and french fries. Specialties include polenta, made of corn meal; risotto with cuttlefish ink sauce. Diners should however be aware that for every genuinely wonderful restaurant or trattoria, there's another serving rubbish food at inflated prices, especially in the most touristed streets around San Marco. Rule of thumb: if there's a waiter outside pimping for business, it's probably best avoided. 
</p><p><b>Peak eating times</b> start at noon for lunch and from 7pm for dinner. That is when places will get crowded and when it will be better to make a reservation beforehand.
</p><p>Near the Rialto bridge there's a row of restaurants with tables by the canal, where you can have the quintessential Venice experience of dining by the canal lights. Although they do have waiters outside bugging you, some have pretty acceptable quality for price, which is almost always expensive anyway.
</p><p>In Venice, as in many other Italian cities, people meet before dinner for the ritual of happy hour at a so called ‘<b>bacari</b>’, that is characteristic osterias or wine bars where you can find a lively and genuine atmosphere. Here you can drink some typical aperitifs such as the famous ‘spritz’ (a cocktail made of Prosecco wine and Aperol or Campari) or taste the ‘cicchetti’ (tasty snacks, such as small croutons, meat cooked on a spit, savoury pastries and typical Venetian dishes, both hot and cold, fried and not). 
</p><p>One of Venice's trademark foods is cuttlefish and its ink. This intense black ink serves as a sauce and ingredient for polenta (corn meal), risotto (rice), and pasta. These dishes are normally indicated by the Italian words "nella seppia" (in cuttlefish), "alla seppia" (in the style of cuttlefish), or "nero di seppia," (black of the cuttlefish). For example Polenta Nella Seppia is fried corn meal with the black ink of a cuttle fish. Despite the intensity in color, the ink has a surprisingly mild taste. 
</p><p>Be careful when the prices are on a weight basis (typically by the "etto", abbreviated "/hg". or 100 g). One dish can easily contain 400g of fish or meat (almost a pound) - coming to 4 times the indicated base price!
</p><p>Restaurants might offer low prices for food on their menus that they advertise outside the entrance, but they will sometimes compensate this by charging high prices for drinks (which is naturally *not* advertised). €5 for 33 cl of beer is not uncommon. Le Bauta, an eatery on Fond del Gaffaro, is a good example. Also, please make sure that you get your change back after payment as sometimes it may be 'forgotten' by the waiters.<br />
There are different ways of adding cover charges ('coperto', 2 or 3 EUR) and service charges (up to 12%) to the final bill.<br />
Check if they are included in what might appear to be a bargain.<br />
Some places will advertise their lack of cover charges. Still, the have to meet the same costs as everyone else. So compare prices carefully. Also be aware that many restaurants refuse to provide tap water - hence given the already inflated prices (compared to Italian averages), dining in Venice can be quite expensive.
</p><p>For fresh fruit (including chilled coconut) watch for the street market stalls. There is always a boat parked in the canal on campo San Barnaba (Dorsoduro, open till late) and then end of Via Giuseppe Garibaldi (Castello, open till around mid-day) selling fruit and vegetables.
</p><p>To save money at lunch, eat standing up - that's what Venetians themselves do. Every cafe, trattoria, osteria, enoteca or whatever it chooses to call itself is stocked at lunchtime with cicchetti - Venetian tapas, including tramezzini (triangular sandwiches on white bread), bite-sized rolls with various cold cuts, polpette (fried balls of minced fish or meat) and assorted antipasti. Order by pointing at what you want on the glass shelves, and wash the whole thing down with a glass of wine (un' ombra) or a spritz (made with, in order of bitterness and alcohol content, Aperol, Campari or Select). Bear in mind that as soon as you allow yourself to sit at the table and be waited on, instead of ordering and consuming your food at the counter, the prices for the same items go up - you can end up paying double. If you look at the (government-mandated) chart of prices stapled to the wall near the bar, you'll see 2 columns of numbers, accommodating this arrangement. However, sitting is worth it if you plan on staying a while. Some places will also serve bread and water for seated patrons, but then there is usually also a small charge (€1-3 per person) for "pane e coperto" (bread and cover charge).
</p><p>If self-catering, the Rialto food markets are an absolute must for fruit, vegetables and cheese, but most of all for the huge range of seafood, much of it fresh out of the lagoon and still moving! There are a variety of small stores around the city that sell fruits and vegetables, but tourists will be hard-pressed to find them. Anything else you will find in the one of the few supermarkets in the city.
</p><p>Head to the Dorsoduro area of Venice if you want to save a few euros. It is located on the south side of the city. It has the highest concentration of places where locals, especially students, go to eat.  Generally staying away from the main squares will be the cheapest option.  If you're willing and able to walk around the town, some back streets offer the best food for the lowest price.  Seeing the city from this vantage point is a lot of fun too! The food here tends to be of a higher standard than the touristy areas in central Venice.

<ul><li>Try a <b>Spritz</b> (with either Campari, Select or Aperol mixed with Prosecco wine and Seltzer), a typical drink loved by all Venetians that's usually drunk while eating <i>cicchetti</i>.  You can find it in almost every bar in the city. Price is about EUR 3-5, more in a touristy place.</li>
<li>Try the famous Veneto <b>grappa</b>, tastes strong but is 40-50% abv.</li>
<li>The <b>Bellini</b> was invented in Harry's Bar in Venice.  It is a mix of white peach juice and Prosecco (the ubiquitous Venetian Champagne-like sparkling wine).  Fermented at a low temperature Prosecco develops amylic aromas (fruit drops), though these perhaps mix better with fruit juices than does the more austere Champagne. Classic Bellinis should never be made with Champagne. Although by normal standards expensive, a Bellini in Harry's Bar (€17 for a 1.5 oz  [45ml&#160;?] drink is obscene) is still much cheaper than on the terraces of similar '5-star' establishments in the city.</li></ul>

<p>Coffee is everywhere in Venice, and both Venetians and the tourists avail themselves of the opportunities, usually by downing a quick dose at the counter (see warning about sit-down prices above). Rule of thumb: the bigger (and shinier) the espresso machine, the better the result. One of the favorites is the mini-chain <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.rosasalva.it/">"E Rosa Salva"</a>, with three locations in the center - on C. Fiubera (from Piazza San Marco, take the underpass in the middle of the arcade, cross the bridge and take second right off C. Fabbri), Merceria S. Salvadore (off the campo of the same name), and right on Campo San Zanipolo (to the right of the church looking from the canal); the last one is a gelateria as well. For your €1 you'll get exactly 2 and a half sips at the bottom of a small cup, with rich crema and no bitterness. Assorted house-made sweets are €1.10.
</p><p>If you're in St Mark's Square you may want to visit two of the most famous cafes in Venice and the world. Please note that these places are very expensive but they are considered a landmark.

<p>There are two late-night drinking areas in Venice.  Piazza San Marco is not one of them.  Although it is very pleasant and there are many people wandering around late.  But the actual late night scene is in either <b>Campo Santa Margherita</b>, near the University Ca' Foscari in Dorsoduro; or in <b>Erbaria</b> on the West side of the Rialto Bridge where the main vegetable market is held during the day.
</p><p>Although there are many fantastic bars in Venice, if you're planning a night time "pub crawl" you should plan a few places to visit in advance, otherwise it's very easy to waste an hour wandering aimlessly in search of a watering hole that's actually open (especially midweek).
</p><p>Locals in search of nighttime entertainment mostly head over the bridge into Mestre, or hop the boat to Lido. One exception: F.ta della Misericordia, in Cannaregio (north from the Ghetto over the Ghetto Nuove bridge, turn right), features several bars in succession, anchored by the <i>Paradiso Perduto</i> (Cannaregio 2640; a restaurant by day, live music on Sundays starting at 9), along the canal. In season they are spilling over after dark with youths holding large glasses of ros&#233;, while more of those same youths are cruising (in motor boats) blaring rap songs in Italian from the loudspeakers. The cafes and bars lining the expansive C. Santa Margherita are catering to the students from the nearby university; chill out to reggae sets in <i>Caffé Rosso</i> (Dorsoduro 2963), or dance (Saturdays only) at <i>Round Midnight</i> (Dorsoduro 3102).

</p><p>Due to Venice's historic city constrained area and touristic importance hotels are expensive. Bed and Breakfasts and guesthouses offer better rates, and real budget solutions (like campings and hostels) can be found on <a href="/en/Mestre" title="Mestre">Mestre</a> (Venice mainland) train station area and <a href="/en/Lido" title="Lido">Lido</a>. These are worth considering since historic centre is quite well connected with bus and ferries, so staying outside is not such a big problem. Alternatively once you get your bearings, it can be surprisingly quick to walk to the main sights when staying in the outer parts of the centre (in other words, it's not a 'must' be in the absolute centre). Staying away from the centre can also provide some welcome quiet compared to the busy inner city areas.
</p><p>In the last few years,  holiday or short rentals apartments have increased in number and quality, now you can rent (minimum stay is usually 3 nights) a Palazzo on the Grand Canal as a little flat near Rialto.
</p><p>It is worth trying to book accommodation on higher floors, as opening ground floor windows can mean that unpleasant smells of the city enter your accommodation (which typically include cigarette smoke and the smell of people having relieved themselves on the streets).

<p>Venice has several internet cafes, but they are much more expensive than the rest of Europe with prices for an hour of access around €6. Wi-Fi is only available at some of them. There's a wonderful pub, Cafe Blue in Dorsoduro, which has free (password-protected) Wi-Fi. Buy a spritz and some panini and go to town.
</p><p>At the Telecom Italia Future Centre in Campo San Salvatore (San Marco) you can browse for free for one hour, once registered with your ID card.
</p><p>If you buy any of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://veniceconnected.com/">VeniceCard</a> products (transport and museum entrance in various combinations) of 24 or more hours' duration, it will automatically include, either at no additional charge or for an extra €3 depending on the season, the access codes for the municipal wireless network.

<p>"I must see Venice before I die" is a famous saying among many who hope to someday see the famed <i>City of Canals,</i> but staying safe while visiting Venice's many historic and beautiful tourist stops must still take top priority. In general, Venice has a reputation of being a relatively safe city, but it does have some dangers you should be on your guard against, including:
</p>
<ul><li><b>An abundance of pickpockets:</b> To keep your money, valuables, passport and other important papers safe, never store them in a bag, purse or pants pocket. Invest in a body-belt pouch, which you can wear below your shirt. Keeping items out of sight and putting obstacles in the way of snatching them will greatly reduce the risk that pickpockets pose.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Financial (tax) Police checking receipts:</b> In Venice (and Italy in general), you need to retain a receipt as proof of lawful (read: properly taxed) purchases, even if it is just a cappucino. Failure to show a receipt (upon a very rare request) after leaving the premises might result in a fine. In some supermarkets, which offer self-service-checkout, you need to scan your receipt at special exit barriers.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>No swimming:</b> In Venice swimming in the canals is strictly forbidden: not only because the water may be mixed with sewage (see Stay Healthy section), but swimmers and divers who get caught are fined up to hundreds of euros, may be denied access to the town and in some cases criminally prosecuted. Jumping off a bridge can be dangerous, especially those on busy canals.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Acqua Alta:</b> means "high water," and can result in several inches of water leaking out of pavements, puddling in piazzas and greeting you just outside your hotel in the morning. Acqua alta is especially prevalent during the winter, but it can strike even during the summer given high tide and/or a little rain. Expect flooding when city workers start assembling the stacked planks and supports into continuous walkways.<br />The official <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://www.comune.venezia.it/it/content/la-previsione#inglese">Tide forecast</a> is usually very accurate and updated several times per day (so check regularly).<br />Expect wet feet around San Marco from 80cm above normal. Best check with your host whether your accomodation might be affected from flooding.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Pigeons in tourist zones:</b> In <i>St. Mark's Square</i> and other parts of Venice, pigeons will crowd the pavement, lie flat to the ground and welcome any bread crumbs you care to offer them. As long as you keep a respectable distance, there is no harm in feeding them. However, it is officially forbidden to feed them and you should be aware that pigeons often carry diseases such as <i>Chlamydiosis,</i> which resembles the flu in its effects; and <i>Psittacosis,</i> which is much like pneumonia. <b>Do not</b> buy grain to feed pigeons.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Narrow, crowded streets:</b> There are streets in Venice so small that only one person can walk on them at a time, and you cannot be sure someone else will not come from the other direction. Even where maps do not indicate a narrow street of this kind, you may well find one, so choose routes carefully and walk on them cautiously. Also be prepared to cross crowded bridges with care. They sometimes have an odd mix of tourists stopping for a snapshot and locals hurrying home from work, which makes for a somewhat "accident-prone situation."</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Porters and carts:</b> goods transport is done by hand-pulled carts and the carters are usually in a hurry and mostly they have to reverse their carts on top of the bridges to negotiate the steps. Try to steer clear.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Wooden jetties and mooring poles</b> are subject to decay. Watch out for rotten or missing planks and test poles before leaning on them for a better view.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Security:</b> expect to see heavily armed police patrolling the streets and airport-style frisking before entering popular sights.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bags and rucksacks</b> might not be allowed in crowded places or where a careless turn might cause damage to priceless exhibits and expensive wares. Lockers are usually available in such cases.</li></ul>
<p>In case of need, you can dial free of charge on any phone <b>112</b> (no area code needed) to contact Carabinieri or <b>113</b> (no area code needed) to contact the Police.
</p>

<ul><li>Venice is progressively installing septic tanks in buildings, but many buildings still have the old system where sewage settles in pits with sewage water overflowing into the canals without treatment. Avoid bathing yourself, touching the water, immersing feet, etc. in the canals looking for refreshment in the hot season or fun pictures during <i>acqua alta</i>. Remember that you probably do not want to use boots indoors after wading through water.<br />In the warmest months, these conditions can generate sometimes foul odors.  Choose other times to visit if they might ruin what should be a highly-enjoyable visit.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Also, at night there is a risk of falling into the water, as there are many alleys which end in the water but have little or no lighting.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Beware where you put your feet: pet owners are not often polite and leave everything their friends by-produce on the ground (this may apply to humans too). Small, dark, back alleys are often similar to mine fields.</li></ul>
<ul><li>You can reach the emergency medical service dialling free of charge on any phone <b>118</b> (no area code needed - conversation will be recorded) to have assistance and an ambulance sent to you.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Chemists' shops (Italian: <i>Farmacia</i>, marked by green crosses) are all around the town. They are open 24hrs. a day  / 7 days a week on a rotational basis: outside the shop there's always the list of operating ones with time-table, address and phone number.<br />If you need a special-treatment drug you might be asked to book it in advance if it's not of so common use. Please, note that the commercial name or brand of your prescription might differ from your country of origin. Make sure before leaving your country of origin that you can have all you need even in the EU.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Practically all your walking will be on stone surfaces. Consider using soft-soled shoes or thicker socks.<br />Also, surfaces will be cold outside of warm weather and sunshine, so plan for warm footwear.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Be aware that at low tide steps leading to the water are wet and extremely slippery, as well as worn out and uneven. Always make sure you hold on to something solid.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Indoor floors often have terrazzo surfaces, which is a hard, cold and often very smooth material. Consider bringing slippers of some kind, if you intend to stay at apartments or hotels.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Mosquitos can be a nuisance. Be careful when leaving windows open.<br />While they do not carry infectuous deseases, they can be irritating and you might want to bring your preferred treatment for insect bites.</li></ul>

<p>The unfortunate side-effect of the quaint back-alleys which make Venice such a delight to visit is that it is remarkably easy to get lost. Even maps provided by hotels are frequently inaccurate, and the maze-like structure of the city can become very confusing indeed. The tight cluster of little islands that comprise Venice is completely surrounded by the Lagoon, so it is not possible, no matter how lost you become, to leave Venice on foot. Sooner or later you will come upon a piazza that you can locate on your map or navigational device.
</p><p>Navigating by smartphone in Venice works pretty well these days (it takes a lot of effort to bring signals into narrow alleys surrounded by thick, often damp walls!). Still, if in doubt, check your position in a larger area with clear view of the sky.
</p><p><b>Tips:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>As you cross bridges, note the house numbers before and after.  A small change probably means you are on the same island/district and have crossed a "new" canal.  A major change means you are now on another island.  Most maps clump islands together into their voting districts, there are many more islands than districts.</li>
<li>Look at the green overhead lamps. They usually have a small number (red on white) with the first two letters giving the sestiere you are in (SM: San Marco, CS: Castello, and so on).</li></ul>
<p>One piece of assistance is to look for directional signs. These will be marked "Per" and then with the name of a prominent location or bridge in the city, complete with an arrow pointing in the relevant direction. Hence, to get to the Rialto bridge, the signs to follow are marked "Per Rialto". Those to St Mark's Square read "Per S Marco", and those to the train station "Per Ferrovia" (there are some others as well). Having oriented yourself to the nearest landmark, direction-finding can thus become (slightly) easier.<br />Do not be irritated by signs giving the same destination but pointing opposite ways. Just pick the one that looks more interesting or is less crowded. Also be aware that unfortunately where a street is a dead-end, there are no signs to advise of this. 
</p><p>Remember, though, that the signs to read are the <i>official</i> ones. Graffiti will occasionally give other directions, frequently incorrect ones. That's not an easy choice, as signs are not standard format. They might be painted overhead on a wall, printed on metal, whatever, even paper signs put up by shop owners tired of being asked for directions all the time.<br />Towards the end of the day, you might take your cue from the crowds. The majority of people will be headed towards Rialto or Piazzale Roma/Ferrovia.<br />Early in the morning (say, before eight o'clock) people in a hurry will be heading for work, coming from a vaporetto stop. Good cue.
</p><p>That said, some argue that getting lost in Venice is part of the experience of the city. The number of photogenic canals, hidden restaurants and shops where glass blowing is done almost guarantees that there is no such thing as a "dull neighbourhood". Additionally, the public transport means that it is relatively easy to arrive at the intended destination even after one has emerged from the web of alleys in a totally unexpected place.
</p><p>Also, it helps to know the meaning of street names.<br /><i>Note that these hints are true in the majority of cases. An occasional change in street layout might not become reflected in a changed name...</i>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Calle</b> is a street that has access from two (or more) directions.</li>
<li><b>Campo</b> is a public square with usually more then one exit</li>
<li><b>Campiello</b> is a smaller square, sometimes just a widening of the street, not always with an extra exit</li>
<li><b>Ramo</b> means a dead end</li>
<li><b>Corte</b> also a dead end, sometimes leading into a private street</li>
<li><b>Sottoportego</b> is a public walkway underneath a building, leading to other streets or some point of interest to 'the public'</li>
<li><b>Fondamenta</b> is a walkway along a canal, usually with a waterside railing</li>
<li><b>Ponte</b> means bridge.</li>
<li><b>Rio tera</b> designates a road created by filling in or covering a canal (sometimes inlaid lines indicate the former canal)</li>
<li><b>Salizida</b> is a main road connecting two (church) districts (so it has another exit), usually including a bridge, as there used to be one church per island</li>
<li><b>Parochia</b> is not a type of street, but you will see it often as it denotes (the border of) a church district</li>
<li><b>Rio</b> is a river (even if it does not look like one anymore)</li>
<li><b>Ruga</b> is a long calle, often originally a (former) street for business</li>
<li><b>Riva</b> is a 'riverside' (well, waterside) promenade</li></ul>
<p>Exits on the far side might not be obvious from where you enter or look into an alley. Sometimes they are flush with the walls on the side and/or very narrow.
</p><p>At crowded times (such as the Venetian Carnival) police will direct traffic and set up temporary one-way-alleys, you might be forced on detours.
</p><p>In rain, be aware that limited drainage means that the streets can get very wet. Hence it may be worth carrying clean socks/shoes, if possible.

<p>Venice is an ancient monument and does not adapt easily to modern requirements.
</p><p>Most areas outside the main tourist attractions (around San Marc's square) are unsupportive of any kind of mobility aid, be it strollers, wheelchairs, walkers or crutches.
</p><p>Any person with a walking impairment will frequently need strong aid to negotiate uneven surfaces and the steps of the many bridges, narrow doorways and cramped restaurants.
</p><p>Some bridges along the waterfront near San Marc's square or Zattere have ramps installed (at least during peak tourist times), so you will be able to reach the boat landings. But raised walkways during acqua alta will be next to impossible to use.
It is essential to inquire beforehand and plan your daily routes.
</p><p>Vaporetto services are mostly accessible to wheeled aids (with special seats and space), though it might be an effort to get onto the smaller boats (like the 4.x or 5.x lines).<br />Still, expect ramp angles to vary with the tide and, of course, the step onto a moving boat.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rubbish_and_waste">Rubbish and waste</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Venice&amp;action=edit&amp;section=70" title="Edit section: Rubbish and waste">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Generally make sure that any rubbish goes into rubbish bins. Otherwise it will probably end up in the water and be washed into the lagoon.<br />Remember that a lot of food is grown locally, so any carelessness has a direct impact. General rubbish bins on streets are hard to find - the best option is to search in the nearest major square for a bin. Be aware that Venice is generally unclean with litter (particularly cigarette butts) a common sight throughout the city.
</p><p>There is usually no space for conventional rubbish bins in buildings and alleys.<br /> 
Also, rubbish is seperated into
</p>
<ul><li>general rubbish</li>
<li>paper</li>
<li>plastic</li></ul>
<p>Details are usually posted inside your apartment.
</p><p>When staying at an apartment you have a choice of rubbish collection options:
</p>
<ul><li>Collection from your place
<ul><li>General waste is collected Mondays to Saturdays</li>
<li>Plastic, glass and paper are collected on alternate days (except Sunday)<br /></li>
<li>The schedule will usually be posted in your apartment by your hosts.<br />Bagged rubbish is picked up by handing it over to the workers calling at your door before noon. This is usually not what tourists will hang around for.</li></ul></li>
<li>Depositing it at collection points
<ul><li>Inside your apartment you will find a map with locations where to bring your rubbish and at what times.<br />This will usually be at a canal for the proximity the moored boat.</li>
<li>You need to observe seperation rules.</li>
<li>You can bring all sorts of rubbish any day (unlike with the previous option)</li>
<li>This will be most agreeable with tourists.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><i>Using the old system of depositing rubbish outside your building might result in a fine of 167 EUR minimum.</i>

<p>In recent years, public restrooms have been set up around the tourist areas. Look out for little blue-ish signs saying "WC" overhead or on the pavement. There is a fee of about 1.5 Euro, best kept ready in coins.
These will even accommodate people using mobility aids.
</p><p>Bars and restaurants often have restrooms, but that is not a guarantee in small places.
</p>
<ul><li>While most of them have toilet seats these days, they will often be unheated and little can be done about the cramped space. Sometimes even a backpack will be too difficult.</li>
<li>They are often unisex stalls.</li>
<li>Also remember, that those are not public facilities but a service to actual patrons.</li></ul>

<li><a href="/en/Torcello" title="Torcello">Torcello</a> - small almost deserted island, rich of art and history. Though there is not much to see in Torcello except for the old church, and the supposed "Throne of Attila". However, the peace and tranquility of the island is not to be found anywhere else in Venice. Torcello is also home to a very expensive Cipriani restaurant. But just walking around on these islands is a nice enough experience.</li>
<li>Cimitero. If you've had enough of the hype and the other tourists, hop off the vaporetto at 'Cimitero', Venice's graveyard for a peaceful walk. There are many famous tombs, and the section dedicated to deceased children is particularly haunting. There is also a free toilet there.</li></ul>
