<p><b>Toronto</b> is the most populous city in <a href="/en/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> and the provincial capital of <a href="/en/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>. It is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. Toronto has a population of 2.8 million, and it is at the heart of the <a href="/en/Greater_Toronto_Area" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a> (GTA) which contains 6.2 million people.  The city is the anchor of the <a href="/en/Golden_Horseshoe" title="Golden Horseshoe">Golden Horseshoe</a> region, which wraps around Lake Ontario from Toronto to Niagara Falls and totals over 8.5 million residents, approximately a quarter of Canada's entire population. Toronto is the fourth largest city and fifth largest urban agglomeration in <a href="/en/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>. 
</p><p>Spawned out of post-glacial alluvial deposits and bluffs, the area was populated at different times by Iroquois and later Wyandot (Huron) peoples. The settlement by Europeans started with the French building a seldom occupied fort near today's Exhibition grounds in the mid-1700s, then grew out of a backwoods English trading post established as York in 1793 (reverting to the current name Toronto in 1834). Later in the 19th century, it grew to become the cultural and economic focus of <a href="/en/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Owing largely to the country's liberal immigration policies starting in the 1960s, and the region's strong economy, Toronto has, in recent decades, been transformed into one of the most culturally and ethnically diverse cities in the world. More than 80 ethnic communities are represented, and over half of the city's residents were born outside Canada.

<p>Covering more than 600 square kilometres, Toronto stretches some 32 kilometres along the shores of Lake Ontario, and includes a dense, urban core surrounded by an inner ring of older suburbs followed by an outer ring of post-war suburbs. The city is laid out on a very straightforward grid pattern and streets rarely deviate from the grid, except in cases where topography interferes such as the indented, curved Don River Valley and to a lesser degree the Humber and Rouge valleys at opposite ends of the city. Some main thoroughfares do intersect the grid at angles. The six Toronto districts are:

<b>Mississauga</b>, located to the immediate west of Toronto, is a large suburb.  Travellers should note that Pearson Airport is technically in Mississauga.  Accordingly, some airport-adjacent hotels will have a Mississauga address, and public transport in Mississauga is a separate system from Toronto's, with a separate fee structure.

<p>In 1998, the cities of Toronto, Scarborough, North York, Etobicoke, and York and the Borough of East York amalgamated to form the current City of Toronto. This is also known as Metropolitan Toronto or "the 416" after its area code (although now there are some new area codes, the majority of landline phone numbers in the Toronto area are still "416").  The city has a population of over 2.6 million people, of which more than half of its residents were born outside of Canada, and as a result the city is fortunate to host many vibrant bustling neighbourhoods with street signs in several languages.
</p><p>Toronto and its surrounding suburbs are collectively known as the <a href="/en/Greater_Toronto_Area" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a> (GTA). Outlying suburbs are also known as "the 905" after <i>their</i> area code, although technically this code is also used in both <a href="/en/Hamilton_(Ontario)" title="Hamilton (Ontario)">Hamilton</a> and the <a href="/en/Niagara_Region" class="mw-redirect" title="Niagara Region">Niagara Region</a>, stretching to the border within <a href="/en/Niagara_Falls_(Ontario)" title="Niagara Falls (Ontario)">Niagara Falls</a>. The entire area including Toronto is known as the "Golden Horseshoe" and has a population of over 8 million people. Distances between cities in the area can be great as it sprawls along, outward and even wraps around the western end of Lake Ontario. Public transit is not always effective enough for a quick or seamless trip and many suburban residents rely on motor vehicles to get around. 
</p><p>A popular urban myth has it that the United Nations rated Toronto as "the most multicultural city in the world." While the UN and its agencies are not in the habit of rating cities, it remains a fact that Canada is a nation of immigrants, and Toronto demonstrates this abundantly. A UN agency lists Toronto as second only to Miami as the city with the most foreign-born residents, but Toronto's residents represent far more cultural and language groups, which is arguably a better measure of multi-culturalism. Most immigrants either pass through Toronto on their way to other parts of the country or stay in Toronto permanently. Many people born abroad consider themselves, and are considered, to be as Canadian as native born Canadians, and asserting or behaving as though otherwise is considered offensive, especially so in Toronto. This contributes to the overall cultural mosaic that is Toronto today. Within Toronto, most ethnic groups will work their way into the fabric of Canadian society but some still retain their distinct ways such as language, dress (if only for special occasions), custom, and food.
</p><p>As a result of this cultural mosaic, Toronto is home to many ethnic festivals throughout the year. Toronto also boasts several radio stations that broadcast in various languages and at least two multicultural television channels. The City of Toronto officially deals in 16 different languages, while the public transit agency <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.ttc.ca">Toronto Transit Commission</a> offers a help line in 70 languages. Even large department stores such as The Bay in downtown Toronto proudly advertise service in nine languages. The lingua franca of Toronto, however, remains English.

<p>Toronto's climate on the whole is on the cool side and variable conditions can be expected. Downtown temperatures average -3.8°C (25°F) in January, but the extreme cold experienced further north typically lasts less than a week at a time. Despite this, come prepared. Winters are still cold and mostly cloudy, at some times snowy and uncomfortably windy and at other times, damp. At times, severe storms can impact flights into and out of the city, as well as slow down transportation and activities in the city for a day or two.
</p><p>The city experiences warm and humid summers with an average high of 27°C (80°F) and a low of 18°C (65°F) in July/August, with many muggy evenings, but rarely extreme heat. The historical annual average of the temperature exceeding 30°C (86°F) is 12 days, but this number has roughly doubled over the last decade. The sun shines more often than not in the summer, but brief thunderstorms occur from time to time, usually lasting less than an hour and bringing heavy rains.
</p><p>The best times to visit for the weather are late spring/early summer or early fall, with comfortably cool nights and less crowds. Mid-summer is the peak tourist season, but visitors will find that Toronto's vibrancy extends throughout the winter with outdoor ice rinks and bundled up clubgoers.

You need to have their apps installed on your phone and accounts set up to use their services, and if you don't have cellphone data, you can connect to Pearson Airport's free wifi. All their car types are available at the airport, meaning if you use their lowest-priced option (e.g. Uber X), you can get to downtown Toronto for much less than a taxi. According to their websites, Uber can get you to downtown starting at $33, while Lyft can get you downtown starting $45. Follow the instructions within their apps to get to the meet up location with your driver.</li></ul>

<b>Billy Bishop Toronto City Centre Airport</b>, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>YTZ</b>), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.torontoport.com/Airport.asp">[19]</a>, (<i>commonly known as "The Island Airport" by locals</i>), handles short-haul regional flights only. Its main tenant is Porter Airlines <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.flyporter.com">[20]</a>, a low-cost carrier that operates flights using turboprop planes to many cities in eastern Canada (Halifax, Moncton, Mont Tremblant, Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec City, Sault Ste. Marie, St. John's, Sudbury, Thunder Bay, Timmins, Windsor) and the northeast United States (Boston, Burlington, Chicago/Midway, Myrtle Beach, New York/Newark, Pittsburgh, Washington/Dulles). Air Canada <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.aircanada.com">[21]</a> provides service to Montreal. One of the main benefits of flying into this airport is its proximity to the downtown core. Upon landing, you can be downtown within ten minutes.
</p><p>An accessible pedestrian tunnel connects the airport terminal to the mainland. Ferry service is also available. It is just 121 m (397 ft) and the world's shortest regularly-scheduled ferry route. It operates between TCCA and the mainland every 15 minutes, 6:45AM-10:07PM. Don't worry, you don't have to buy tickets or anything, you just look for the line (there are separate pedestrian and car lines) and board when directed to do so.  If you are renting a vehicle at YTZ, National and Avis are on the mainland, while Hertz is actually on the island meaning you will get to experience driving on and off the ferry.  Once on the mainland, a free shuttle bus connects the terminal with the Fairmont Royal York Hotel, across the street from Union Station.
</p><p>TTC Streetcars are available a short walk north from the mainland ferry terminal. Route 511 Bathurst provides service north along Bathurst, to Bathurst subway station. Route 509 Harbourfront travels east along the waterfront (Queen's Quay) to Union Station. Both routes end a short distance to the west at Exhibition Place. However, the most convenient connection to TTC Subway and GO Transit services are via the free shuttle to Union Station.
</p><p><b>Hamilton International Airport</b>, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>YHM</b>), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.flyhi.ca/">[22]</a>, located about 80 km from downtown Toronto and Niagara Falls, is served by WestJet and CanJet. This airport is served by the ((Hamilton Street Railway)) from the the Hamilton GO Station (36 Hunter Street East) where you can catch a GO commuter bus to Union Station in downtown Toronto ($9.50 one-way). Buses run every 30 minutes.  A taxi from downtown Hamilton to the airport is about $25.
</p><p>For frugal travellers coming from the United States, <b>Buffalo-Niagara International Airport</b>, (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>BUF</b>), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.buffaloairport.com">[23]</a>, is another option. Flights to Buffalo tend to be significantly cheaper than to Pearson. <b>Megabus</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.megabus.com">[24]</a>, has varying prices and requires early booking. They run from the Buffalo Airport to Toronto. The trip takes 3 hours, including the border crossing. Rental cars are available at the airport if you prefer to do the drive yourself. Buffalo Airport Limo <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://buffaloairportlimo.com">[25]</a> offers a flat rate of $175 to downtown Toronto from BUF.

<p>Most private flights will utilize Toronto City Airport (YTZ) for its proximity to downtown Toronto, and Pearson has five private FBO terminals (Maxwell Aerospace, Signature Flight Support, SkyCharter, SkyService, The Aerospace Centre) and Customs &amp; Immigration services for international travelers. In addition to these airports, <b>Buttonville Municipal Airport</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>YKZ</b>) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.buttonvilleairport.ca/">[26]</a> and <b>Burlington Executive Airpark</b> (ICAO: CZBA) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.burlingtonairpark.com/">[27]</a> offer two additional options for air taxi and general aviation. Air charter companies like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.jetchartercanada.com/">Jet Charter Canada</a> arrange aircraft rentals at each airport in the Greater Toronto Area, with planes ranging from single &amp; twin engine Cessna's to business jets and luxury Gulfstreams.

<p>The main bus terminal in Toronto, the Toronto Coach Terminal (also known as Bay Street Terminal or the Metro Toronto Coach Terminal), is used for intercity coach travel and is served by Coach Canada, New York Trailways, and Ontario Northland. 
</p><p>The bus terminal's main entrance is on Bay Street immediately north of Dundas and the terminal's departures building takes up the northern half of the block bounded by Bay Street, Dundas Street, Edward Street, and Elizabeth Street; the arrivals building is located immediately across Elizabeth Street from the departures building. The departures building is connected by the underground PATH walkway system to Dundas subway station on the Yonge line via the Atrium on Bay shopping centre. The terminal is also several blocks east of St Patrick subway station on the University-Spadina line. Unlike Union Station, the bus terminal has lockers in which people may store luggage. The cost is $5 for 24 hours and you must get a token from one of the token machines located next to the lockers. The lockers are located in the hallway connecting the departures building with the arrivals building. Storing items in lockers overnight is not advisable as break-ins are common at night. Certain items too large to fit in a locker may be stored in the information booth at an extra cost. 
</p><p>The bus terminal in Toronto is very poorly designed, forcing passengers to queue in a space that is little more than a shed with walls on two sides, as a result passengers queueing are forced to inhale the diesel exhaust fumes from the coaches as well as endure the cold winters and hot summers. In addition, there are often queues so long for the commuter coaches that they block other coaches from reaching their platforms. Platforms are also poorly marked, and it is not difficult to queue up for the wrong bus. <b>Do not hesitate to ask anyone for help.</b> Most people in the terminal have plenty of experience with it and understand how difficult it is to navigate. Arrive at the terminal at least 30 minutes before your coach is scheduled to depart. You can avoid the hassle of having to purchase tickets at the terminal; it is generally faster to buy tickets online if possible. If you must purchase tickets at the terminal, be wary of peak travel periods, as the line can take up to 20 minutes.

<p>Coach Canada buses to Montreal stop at the Scarborough Centre bus station to the east of central Toronto, this station lies on the former Scarborough RT mass transit line. Coach Canada buses to Buffalo and New York also stop near Union Station, either in front of the York Street entrance to the Royal York Hotel or on University Avenue north of Wellington Street.
Two new, heavily-discounted services between Toronto and New York City now operate from the sidewalk in front of the Royal York Hotel, across the street from Union Station. Both advertise electrical connections at each seat, wi-fi, movies, and more legroom than traditional buses. If purchased far enough in advance, tickets can be found for $1 although in reality, most seats range from $15 to $50.

<p>All scheduled passenger trains in Toronto run into and out of <b>Union Station</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.toronto.ca/union_station/index.htm">[34]</a>, which is located at 65 Front Street, between Bay and York Streets. Opened in 1927, Toronto's Union Station is generally considered to be one of the grandest, most impressive train stations in North America; with an enormous great hall, the ceiling rising to a height equivalent to seven stories. Despite this impressive hall, most of the activity in the station takes place in the underground concourses which link the commuter rail platforms with the subway station. The great hall is still used for purchasing intercity rail tickets with a row of ticket booths and several ticket machines. The train station is served by a subway station with the same name, accessible from the GO concourse. The main intercity concourse is accessed from the great hall, but all commuter rail platforms are accessed from the underground GO Transit concourse, as is the Union Station Bus Terminal across the street. The GO Transit concourse is accessed by taking any one of the three large staircases in the great hall or directly from the subway.
</p><p>Union Station is undergoing a significant renovation and heritage restoration, scheduled to conclude in 2017. While work is in progress, some areas may be inacessible. Detours are in effect between the subway station and the concourses. Follow posted signs or ask a fellow traveller for directions.
</p><p>Most intercity rail travel in Canada is provided by <b>VIA Rail</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.viarail.ca/en_index.html">[35]</a>. Union Station is one of VIA Rail's main hubs and connects several of their lines. Railway lines operated by VIA Rail out of Union Station include:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Corridor</b>&#8212;This is VIA's busiest line running from <a href="/en/Windsor_(Ontario)" title="Windsor (Ontario)">Windsor</a> and <a href="/en/Sarnia_(Ontario)" class="mw-redirect" title="Sarnia (Ontario)">Sarnia</a> in the southwest to <a href="/en/Quebec_City" title="Quebec City">Quebec City</a> in the northeast. Regular trains run from Toronto directly to <a href="/en/Montreal" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="/en/Ottawa" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, <a href="/en/London_(Ontario)" title="London (Ontario)">London</a>, <a href="/en/Kingston_(Ontario)" title="Kingston (Ontario)">Kingston</a>, <a href="/en/Windsor_(Ontario)" title="Windsor (Ontario)">Windsor</a>, and <a href="/en/Sarnia_(Ontario)" class="mw-redirect" title="Sarnia (Ontario)">Sarnia</a> as well as stations in between. The lines between Montreal and Toronto and Ottawa and Toronto are VIA's busiest and most frequent, they also have the largest discounts if booked well in advance. There are two classes of service, business and economy.  Business class includes meals and alcoholic beverages.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Maple Leaf</b>&#8212;This service is run jointly by VIA and U.S. passenger rail company, Amtrak, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/HomePage">[36]</a>. Trains on this line run between Toronto and <a href="/en/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> once a day in each direction stopping at <a href="/en/Albany_(New_York)" title="Albany (New York)">Albany</a> and <a href="/en/Buffalo_(New_York)" class="mw-redirect" title="Buffalo (New York)">Buffalo</a> as well as many smaller stations. Trains between Toronto and New York are extremely slow and very expensive, the coach services listed above generally take several hours less and cost several times less than the train. There are also more frequent trains that run on this line from Toronto to <a href="/en/Niagara_Falls_(Ontario)" title="Niagara Falls (Ontario)">Niagara Falls</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>The Canadian</b>&#8212;Trains on this line run the transcontinental route from Toronto to <a href="/en/Vancouver" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> three times a week each way, stopping at a large number of smaller stations on the way. Cities that this train passes through include: <a href="/en/Winnipeg" title="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="/en/Saskatoon" title="Saskatoon">Saskatoon</a>, <a href="/en/Edmonton" title="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, <a href="/en/Jasper" title="Jasper">Jasper</a> and <a href="/en/Kamloops" title="Kamloops">Kamloops</a>. The full journey takes about three days. This is one of the most expensive rail journeys in North America and is many times more expensive than flying. However, Via rail runs 'express deals' 2-3 weeks before travel that can reduce the price on this route by 75 percent. The trains contain both sleeper berths and cabins, as well as reclining economy seating. Three meals per day are cooked in the train's dining car.  These are included in sleeper fares and are available for purchase for economy passengers.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Commuter train</b>&#8212;Services in the <a href="/en/Greater_Toronto_Area" title="Greater Toronto Area">Greater Toronto Area</a> are operated exclusively by <b>GO Transit</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gotransit.com/">[37]</a>, who run all of their trains from Union Station. Their trains serve mainly the sprawling suburbs around the city and most of the train lines run only during rush hour; at other times of the day, they are replaced by bus services. Most of these buses originate from Union Station Bus Terminal across Bay Street from the railway station; there is an overhead walkway from the GO Train concourse to the bus terminal.</li></ul>

<p>Major highways leading into Toronto are the QEW, the 404, the 401, the 400, and the 427. Toronto is in the enviable position of being the largest city in Canada, so it's relatively easy to find a sign pointing you in the right direction. Be advised that traffic on incoming highways can be extremely heavy. In the downtown core there are many turn restrictions, particularly from main thoroughfares to other main thoroughfares (e.g. Yonge to Dundas Streets). 
</p><p>The main streets in Toronto are laid out in a grid pattern that makes it one of the easiest cities to get around in by car.  Getting from point to point anywhere in the city can be achieved with only a few turns.  Parking in the downtown core can be expensive and hard to find, but is plentiful and inexpensive or free throughout the rest of the city.

<p>Toronto follows some bylaws related to the transit system that often confuse or surprise visiting drivers:
</p>
<ul><li>If a bus is signalling intent to merge into traffic from a stop, you must yield to the bus.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If a streetcar in front of you and travelling in your direction has its doors open, you cannot pass the open doors.
<ul><li>However, if a traffic island (it'll look like a raised median with a transit shelter on top) separates the streetcar from your lane, you may pass with caution.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>Occasionally the rightmost travel lane on certain streets (most notably on Bay Street between Front and Bloor Sts.) is reserved from 7AM-7PM for transit vehicles, taxis and bicycles only; you can enter these lanes only to make a right turn at the next cross street. If you do decide to travel as through-traffic in these lanes, you may be liable to a fine (an often hefty one).</li></ul>
<p>Additionally, drivers are advised that Torontonians generally take their obligation to give a wide berth to emergency vehicles quite seriously: if you hear sirens or see lights, pull over to the side of the road safely but quickly.

<p>The trip to the Toronto Islands from the downtown core (Bay St and Queen's Quay) is a pleasant 15 minute ferry ride, with frequent summer service and the best views of the Toronto skyline.
</p><p>There are also guided sailing vessels that take tours of the inner/outer harbour and circumvent Toronto Island
</p><p>Ferry tickets can be purchased online in advance to skip the long lines at the ferry terminal entrance.

<p>Toronto is huge, and most roads run for very long distances.  Streetcar rail, subway rail, and intercity rail services are clean and efficient but overcrowded, yet it's entirely possible to get around Toronto without a car, especially downtown.  You may find it quicker and easier to drive, but be aware that traffic congestion is severe at almost any time of day, especially during rush hour.  Toronto has plentiful parking garages downtown, most of which can be identified by the prominent green P signs, but they are very expensive, particularly on weekdays.  Toronto is at an angle to geographic north, but most maps are drawn with respect to the shoreline.  This is sometimes called Toronto North.

<p>Toronto has a very large transit system, the third most heavily used in North America (after <a href="/en/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> and <a href="/en/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>). It consists of buses, streetcars, and subway lines. Buses and streetcars are prone to get caught in Toronto's notorious traffic during rush-hours, though some streetcar lines have dedicated lanes.
</p><p>Toronto's long streetcar lines, coupled with more than a decade of service cuts, have resulted in chronic "bunching", where one might wait for thirty minutes at a stop, and then 4 streetcars will arrive bunched together.
</p><p>In contrast to this, the subway system is quite fast and efficient; the subway lines extend well into the suburbs and have spurred a great deal of high-density, high-rise development in far-flung neighbourhoods that would not otherwise have had any large-scale development. A prime example of this is the neighbourhood of <a href="/en/Toronto/North_York" title="Toronto/North York">North York</a>, filled with high-rise development right on top of three subway stations. As a result, the subway is the easiest, fastest and most efficient way to get around the city. Unlike many cities, Toronto's subway lines have extremely frequent service, even late at night. Trains come every five minutes or better from 5:30 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. every day of the week except Sunday, when service starts at 8 a.m.
</p><p>The TTC operates a comprehensive network of overnight bus and streetcar routes called the Blue Night Network. Service runs at 30-minute intervals from 1:30 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. Night routes are numbered starting from 300, and stops with all-night service have a blue 24hr badge at the top.
</p><p>The primary fare media used on the TTC is the Presto Card, which is also usable on many surrounding transit systems, on UP Express between Pearson Airport and downtown, and on GO Transit which provides regional rail and bus service (including service to Niagara Falls).  Presto cards may be purchased at many TTC subway stations, at any staffed GO Transit station, from the UP Express station at Pearson Airport, or from hundreds of other vendors throughout the region.  The card costs $6.00, and can be loaded with any desired amount of money.  To use the card, tap it on the green reader when entering a subway station bus or streetcar.  A green light and a beep will confirm acceptance.  If multiple TTC vehicles (including buses, streetcars and subways) are used to complete a one-way journey under two hours from your intital tap-on, only a single fare will be charged (currently $3.30, $0.05 less than paying with cash).  Separate fares apply on other transit systems.  
</p><p>Cash fare for adults is $3.35 (discounted if you buy several tokens at a time). Student fare is $2.40, seniors is $2.30, and children under the age of 12 are free. Be aware that some token vending machines are out of service, but do not have signs on them to indicate that. It is therefore safer to use manned ticket booths whenever possible. 
</p><p>A day pass is available for $13.50. This pass allows unlimited travel on all TTC services within the City of Toronto, except for Downtown Express buses. For one person, it allows unlimited one-day travel on any day of the week, from the beginning of service until 5:30 a.m. the next morning. On Saturday and Sunday, and statutory holidays, day passes function as a group pass. On these days, two passengers over 19 years old and up to four passengers 19 or under can travel with one TTC Day Pass. The day pass does not have to be purchased on the day of use. 
</p><p>A monthly pass, termed the Metropass, costs $156.00. This pass is also transferable, with no pass-backs.
</p><p>Passes are gradually being adapted for use on Presto cards.  See the TTC website for the latest updates on this.
</p><p>Tokens as well as daily and weekly passes are available at subway stations, variety stores and newsstands throughout the city. Most businesses that sell passes and tokens have a TTC sticker on their front door.

<p>There are three subway lines: 
</p>
<ul><li>The Line-1 Yonge-University-Spadina line runs in a U formation, travelling north-south along Yonge Street, bending at Union Station, then travelling north-south along University Avenue, Spadina Avenue, and Allen Road. It meets the Sheppard line at Sheppard-Yonge station and the Bloor-Danforth line at Bloor-Yonge, St. George, and Spadina stations.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Line-2 Bloor-Danforth line runs east-west along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue. It meets the Yonge-University line at Bloor-Yonge, St. George, and Spadina stations, and meets the Scarborough RT line at Kennedy station. This line runs through a large number of neighbourhoods, Kennedy Station is on Eglinton in working-class <a href="/en/Toronto/Scarborough" title="Toronto/Scarborough">Scarborough</a> and is surrounded by large apartment blocks, it is a major transit hub for TTC buses in Scarborough and also connects with GO Transit commuter trains. The line leaves Scarborough after Warden station and the next nine stations serve a number of densely packed, ethnic neighbourhoods along the Danforth. After Broadview Station, the line crosses the Don River and the following station, Castle Frank, serves the extremely exclusive neighbourhood of <a href="/en/Toronto/Rosedale" title="Toronto/Rosedale">Rosedale</a>. After this, the line crosses the Rosedale ravine and enters <a href="/en/Toronto/Downtown" title="Toronto/Downtown">Downtown Toronto</a>, the next four stations serve the expensive shopping district of <a href="/en/Bloor-Yorkville" class="mw-redirect" title="Bloor-Yorkville">Bloor-Yorkville</a>. Following this, the line serves many small ethnic neighbourhoods centred around Bloor Street. Lansdowne and Dundas West stations serve working class neighbourhoods and Dundas West connects with GO Transit commuter trains. The next two stations serve High Park, a large park on the west side of the city and Runnymede and Jane stations serve the pleasant and relatively affluent neighbourhood of Bloor West Village. The next three stations serve the mostly middle class suburb of <a href="/en/Toronto/Etobicoke" title="Toronto/Etobicoke">Etobicoke</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Line-3 Scarborough RT has permanently shut down as of November 19, 2023. It used to run from the eastern end of the Bloor-Danforth line at Kennedy Station, through central Scarborough to McCowan Station. As its name suggests, this line served the mainly working-class suburb of <a href="/en/Toronto/Scarborough" title="Toronto/Scarborough">Scarborough</a>. This line's main draw for visitors was that it serves Scarborough Town Centre, one of the city's enormous regional shopping centres, at its Scarborough Centre station; this station is also a major regional transit hub and is served by a large number of TTC buses, several GO Transit commuter buses, and is a stop on Coach Canada routes to <a href="/en/Montreal" title="Montreal">Montreal</a> and <a href="/en/Kingston_(Ontario)" title="Kingston (Ontario)">Kingston</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Line-4 Sheppard line runs in an east-west direction along Sheppard Avenue. It meets the Yonge line at Sheppard-Yonge station and terminates at Don Mills Station in the east.</li></ul>
<p>Other TTC services are provided by buses, streetcars, and Wheel-Trans vans (for people with disabilities). There are also a number of <i>Downtown Express</i> buses that run during rush hour, for which additional fare must be paid.
</p><p>The subway hours of operation on weekdays and Saturdays are approximately 6 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., and Sundays/Public holidays  approximately 8 a.m. to 1:30 am.

<p>Toronto is one of the very few cities in North America (and the only city in Canada) to retain its streetcars. All routes run with new low-floor vehicles with wheelchair ramps, and air conditioning. Riders can board using any of the doors, and fare readers are installed on both sides of the doors as you step on.
</p><p>All streetcar routes operate on proof-of-payment rules, meaning that passengers must always keep their transfer, Presto card, or pass for inspection. Fare inspectors do regular patrols, and "failure to surrender fare media" carries a fine of $425. When in doubt, always ask the driver for a transfer if paying by cash or token.  If using a Presto card, simply tap as you board and present the card as proof of payment. More information is available on the TTC's proof-of-payment page. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Fare_information/Proof_of_payment.jsp">[38]</a>

<ul><li>511 runs along Bathurst for nearly all of its route, from Exhibition Place to Bathurst subway station on the Bloor-Danforth line.</li></ul>
<ul><li>512 runs along St Clair Avenue from St Clair subway station on the Yonge line to a streetcar loop just past Keele Street. 512 runs within its own right of way in the centre of St. Clair Avenue from Yonge Street to Gunns Loop, just west of Keele Street, passing through St Clair West subway station on the University-Spadina line. This route serves the neighbourhood of <a href="/en/Toronto/Deer_Park" title="Toronto/Deer Park">Deer Park</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>514 runs along King Street.  The western terminus is immediately adjacent to the west end of the Canadian National Exhibition grounds at Dufferin Street, and the east end is at Cherry Street in Toronto's Distillery District.</li></ul>
<p><br />
Caution: When getting on and off streetcars, make sure that the traffic is stopped in the lane next to the streetcar. While drivers are required by law to stop behind open streetcar doors, some drivers don't. This does not apply when there is a safety island between you and the traffic lane(s). Pickpocketing on the TTC is rare, but stay aware of your surroundings in crowded rush hour situations and avoid keeping valuables in outside pockets.

</p><p>All but two (Routes 99 and 171) of the TTC's bus and streetcar routes have a subway station somewhere on the loop, and while many routes will take you into the station and beyond the ticket barrier, some of them (especially downtown) will take you only to the outside of the station. In this case, you can enter the station by presenting a valid transfer. If you don't have one, you need to pay another cash fare.
</p><p>Transfers are free, but should be obtained at the first vehicle or station you enter on your journey. If your journey starts on a bus or streetcar, ask for one as you pay your fare (simply saying "Transfer, please" to the operator will suffice). If you start at a subway station, look for a red machine just beyond the ticket booth with a digital time clock on its face. Press the gold button and collect your transfer.  If using a Presto card, the transfer is automatically written on the card, unlike paper transfers which is only valid for a one-way continuous trip, Presto users have the ability to hop on or off the TTC repeatedly as many times as they like or change direction within the two hour transfer window.  You must tap your Presto card each vehicle you board (except for those boarded within fare-paid areas of subway stations.) as long as its within the two hour window from the initial tap-on, you will not be charged another fare.
</p><p>A transfer may also be used to pass from a bus or streetcar to another bus or streetcar moving in a perpendicular direction - for example, from a northbound bus to an eastbound streetcar. But in doing so, make sure to transfer at the first intersection possible (i.e. do not get out at an intersection, walk east for a block, and transfer there).

<p>The areas that surround Toronto—<a href="/en/Mississauga" title="Mississauga">Mississauga</a>, Brampton, York Region, Durham Region, Oakville, Burlington, Milton, Hamilton—have their own transit systems. There are no free transfer privileges between the TTC and these other transit systems. To use both the TTC and another system, two fares must usually be paid (though see GTA Pass below). In many places, these networks do overlap, so you can transfer easily. Prices are similar to prices for the TTC. Generally bus services outside Toronto city limits are fairly infrequent, except for a few busy routes (e.g. Mississauga Transit route 1, 19, 26, Brampton 501, 502, 511 or Viva Blue, Purple).
</p><p>A weekly <i>GTA Pass</i> (Greater Toronto Area Pass) is available for $54. It is valid on the TTC and the transit systems in <a href="/en/Mississauga" title="Mississauga">Mississauga</a>, Brampton, York Region, but not Durham Region or Halton Region. This pass is also transferable, although only one rider may use it at a time. If you are travelling through the fare-zone boundary in York Region with a GTA pass, you will have to pay an additional $1.
</p><p>The regional transportation agency, 'Metrolinx', operates the PRESTO <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.prestocard.ca/">[39]</a> farecard system which allow users to pay transit fares throughout the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.  Although fares and transfer rules are set individually by each transit operator, using the card generally provides a discount from the cash fare and discounted or free transfers between certain systems. Cards cost $6 and are not refundable, but visitors making significant use of GO Transit, or several GTA transit systems might find some cost savings and convenience over using cash or tickets.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="GO_Transit">GO Transit</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Toronto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21" title="Edit section: GO Transit">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>A system of <i>regional trains and buses</i>, GO Transit <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gotransit.com">[40]</a>, connects Toronto to its surrounding areas. The majority of these services, especially trains, are oriented to weekday commuters travelling to and from downtown Toronto. GO Transit charges fares by distance.  Trains are large and comfortable, and the vast majority run only during rush hours. The main exception is on the Lakeshore Line between Aldershot and Oshawa, via Union Station, which runs every 30 minutes during off peak times (Midday, Evening and Weekends).Midday, there are trains to Mt. Pleasant in the west and Unionville in the north every hour, with weekend service to Barrie and summer weekend service to Niagara Falls.  The GO bus network is much more extensive and fills in for trains in the off-peak hours, but beware that buses may get delayed due to traffic congestion. The vast majority of tourist destinations are reachable by TTC, although you might want to use the GO to get to the Zoo, or to the homes of family members or friends in the Greater Toronto Area.
</p><p>GO Transit provides service between Toronto and Niagara Falls, approximately hourly, using a combination of train and bus.  Trains run between Toronto and Burlington, where passengers can transfer to a bus for the journey to Niagara Falls.  During summer weekends a special train operates all the way to Niagara Falls, providing one trip on Fridays, and 4 trips per day on Saturdays and Sundays.
</p><p>Discounts on the fares for some connecting transit services are available under certain conditions, if you are travelling to or from a GO Transit rail station, although no discount is available when connecting with the TTC. The GTA Pass is not valid on GO Transit.
</p><p>NOTE: in many cases, a GO bus will not stop unless the passengers-to-be indicate waiting to be picked up, even if they are standing at a designated stop. Users must flag the bus down, usually just by raising their hand or ticket in the air as the bus approaches. That is because GO stops often share stops with other municipal transit systems.
</p><p>All GO Trains operate on the Proof-of-Payment system; passengers must possess a valid ticket for the entire length of their journey when riding. Bus drivers will sell tickets to passengers boarding at locations where there is no ticket office, however tickets cannot be purchased on board GO Trains.  Major train stations have ticket offices, and smaller stations have machines which sell tickets. GO Transit enforcement officers conduct random inspections of tickets, issuing expensive fines to anyone without the correct fare.
</p><p>If using a Presto card on the GO bus or train, be sure to tap your card both at the beginning and end of your trip.  Card readers are located near the entrances to train station platform areas, or next to the driver on buses.  If transferring between train and bus, tap as you leave the first vehicle/station, then again as you enter the next.  Fares will be adjusted for the continuous journey.  If you fail to tap your card at the end of your journey, you will be charged a fare to the end of that vehicle's route.
</p><p>Each GO train runs with a three-person crew. There are two engineers, who are responsible for operations, as well as the Customer Service Ambassador, who is responsible for passenger service (opening/closing doors, making station announcements, answering questions, dealing with emergencies, etc.) The CSA is stationed in the Accessibility car (the 5th car behind the locomotive), and introduces him/herself during his/her opening spiel. If you are unfamiliar with the system, it is recommended that you remain close to them.

<p>Taxis are plentiful and safe, but not cheap. As with most big cities, driving a car downtown can be annoying; parking is often hard to find and expensive, and traffic along certain streets can make vehicle travel slower than mass transit. However, travelling longer distances, when not close to subway lines is often significantly faster by car or taxi.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_bicycle">By bicycle</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Toronto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23" title="Edit section: By bicycle">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>There are many casual cyclists out all the time and cycling is fast: door to door, in all of downtown Toronto, a bike beats a car or transit nearly every time.
</p><p>There is a lack of clear understanding about regulations regarding bicycles and as a result, there can be hostility between automobiles and cyclists. Generally speaking, if you are on the road, you are expected to obey the same laws as cars, and you are not allowed to ride on the sidewalk. In reality, cyclists have all sorts of driving styles; expect the unexpected.
</p><p>The city is predominantly flat, aside from a general climb away from Lake Ontario and the deeply indented, forested Don Valley and Humber River Valley, and post-and-ring locking posts are present throughout the city. There are many bike-only lanes on major roads and threading through various neighbourhoods and parks. The city publishes a cycling map, available on the city website <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.toronto.ca/cycling/map/index.htm">[41]</a>. 
</p><p>Bike Share Toronto <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bikesharetoronto.com/">[42]</a> provides a public bike system with upwards of 9,000 bikes available at over 700 stations throughout much of the city, and is constantly expanding. Download the "PBSC" app to your smartphone to make the experience easier. Subscriptions start at $7 for 24 hours and allow you to use a bike for 30 minutes or less at one time, as many times as you like (usage fees apply for trips longer than 30 minutes but can be avoided by simply docking and unlocking or switching to a different bike before the 30 minutes expires). Bike Share Toronto operates 24 hours a day, all year long (but see the warning below about winter biking). They also offer electrically-assisted bikes (e-bikes), which have an additional cost of $0.10 - $0.20 per minute, and their availability can be shown on the app. Several businesses also offer rentals <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tbn.ca/retailer/rtdb/ar.htm">[43]</a>.
</p><p>It is a provincial law that cyclists under 18 must wear a helmet, and all riders must have a bike with reflectors and a bell.  This tends to only be enforced when the police go on their annual "cycling blitz".
</p><p>The TTC has taken measures to be welcoming of bicycles. All TTC buses have easy to use bike racks, and bicycles are allowed onto the subway during off-peak hours. This allows you to be able to take your bike almost anywhere in the city.
</p><p>Some dangers:
</p>
<ul><li>Beware of parked cars - often accidents are not caused by moving cars, but rather by careless drivers or passengers who unexpectedly open their driver's side door. However, by and large Toronto is about as safe for bikers as most European cities, and certainly safer than most U.S. cities.  Here, at least, cyclists are often expected and respected by drivers.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Be cautious of streetcar tracks as bike wheels can be easily caught and cause a spill. Streetcar tracks are extremely slippery when the road is wet. Always try to cross the tracks at right angles.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Although you will certainly see large numbers of locals riding the streets year-round, be warned that biking in the winter months is enjoyable only with proper equipment and reasonable skills; winter weather does get cold, it can be quite windy, and snow removal is often imperfect.</li></ul>
<p>Some recommended cycling routes:
</p>
<ul><li>By far one of the most popular bike paths is the Martin Goodman Trail, the east-west route that hugs Lake Ontario, spanning the city from Etobicoke to the eastern ends of the city. This path is also often used by pedestrians and rollerbladers.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Don River trail system begins at the lake (near Queen and Broadview) and travels very far North and East. During or after heavy rains, avoid lower sections of the trails.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A special treat for bikers of all levels is a tour out to the Leslie Street Spit lighthouse and bird sanctuaries (no cars!). Start at Queen and Leslie and head south.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Kay Gardiner Beltline Trail is a pleasant, leafy ride through the heart of Midtown Toronto. Access is available from Yonge Street near Davisville Station and many points to the northwest.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Though out of the way, the Humber River trail is nicely paved, long, and scenic. It spans from the Martin Goodman Trail to Humber College and links up to several parks in North Toronto.</li></ul>
<ul><li>A visit to Toronto Islands from the ferry docks at the southern end of Bay Street is a great way to spend a bike-friendly, relaxed afternoon by bike.  There are no cars to speak of on the Toronto Islands.</li></ul>

<p>As Toronto is a very large city and many areas of the city are inadequately served by the public transit system, the car is the most commonly used method of transportation in the Greater Toronto Area. The road system (except for Highway 407 ETR) suffers from traffic congestion at almost all times of day, 7 days a week, and severe traffic congestion occurs during rush hour (approximately 6:30am-10am and 3pm-8pm Monday-Friday. Even Highway 401, with 9 lanes in each direction (making it the world's second largest freeway, after Katy Freeway in Texas) and bypassing Downtown by almost 8 miles North, can experience some slowing during off-peak hours and is jammed like any other freeway. Stay in the local lanes if you are not familiar with the local-express system. Avoid driving during rush hour, and avoid driving in severe weather. Traffic information is available on Google Maps (maps.google.ca, click on the traffic button), 680 News (radio station, AM 680, every 10 minutes on :01, :11, :21, :31, :41, :51 of each hour) and CP24 (television station). Highway 407 ETR [www.407etr.com] is almost never congested, but is a very expensive toll road, also it is strongly recommended that you rent a transponder if you use this highway regularly due to high video toll charges if you do not have a transponder.

<p>Roads in Toronto (including major roads like the Gardiner Expressway, Don Valley Parkway and Lake Shore Boulevard) are frequently closed on weekends for construction or special events, which causes major traffic problems on parallel roads in other parts of the city. Every year there is the "Ride for Heart" which closes both the Don Valley Parkway and Gardiner Expressway on a Sunday morning in late May or early June, causing severe traffic congestion on parallel roads. There are also two marathons per year on Sunday which cause extensive road closures, the "Honda Indy" which closes Lake Shore Boulevard near Exhibition Place, the Pride Toronto parade, the Santa Claus Parade, the St. Patrick's Day Parade and many other events which close major roads practically every weekend from March to November. Furthermore there is an annual weekend closure of the DVP, Gardiner and Allen Road on different weekends for construction.

<p>Eglinton Avenue is under construction between Black Creek Drive and Don Mills Road for the "Eglinton-Crosstown LRT" (partially underground light rail) and construction between Don Mills and Kennedy Road will start in 2016. It is strongly recommended that you avoid this area.

Next door to Old City Hall (currently the court house) which has a more classical architecture.

<ul><li><b>Beaches</b>. Toronto has three main sections of beach along Lake Ontario. The most popular of these is in the aptly named <a href="/en/Toronto/The_Beach" title="Toronto/The Beach">Beaches</a> neighborhood. A less popular alternative is the beaches in the western end of the city in the <a href="/en/Toronto/Parkdale" title="Toronto/Parkdale">Parkdale</a> neighborhood; this was once Toronto's Coney Island, with an amusement park and numerous beach-style attractions; however in the 1950s the city built the Gardiner Expressway along the lakeshore, effectively separating the beaches from the city and causing the demolition of the amusement park; over the years attempts have been made to re-energize this area, but the Gardiner remains a major barrier, as well as a source of noise and pollution to keep away would-be beach-goers. On the plus side, the beaches are largely empty most of the time, providing solitude for those who seek it. The third major beach area in the city runs along the south shore of the <a href="/en/Toronto/Islands" title="Toronto/Islands">Toronto Islands</a>. This area is pleasantly secluded, with most of the islands covered with parkland and a small amusement park. Hanlan's Point Beach on the western shore of the islands is the City of Toronto's only officially recognized clothing-optional beach and a popular gay hangout. Despite these options, many Torontonians prefer to leave the city for beach trips; the most popular beaches are those in the Georgian Bay area north of Toronto, <a href="/en/Wasaga_Beach" title="Wasaga Beach">Wasaga Beach</a> in particular is very popular during the summer.</li>

A great time to visit is during the men's FIFA World Cup competition (in football/soccer), regardless of where in the World it is actually being held as both communities face off and rivalries reach a fever pitch. Recently the rivalries have begun to infect adjacent communities and it is now getting to the point that the entire city is being draped in a mind-numbing variety of flags once every four years.</li>
<li><b>Music</b>. Like many large cities, Toronto has a huge and culturally important music scene. There are thousands of venues around the city to see a show, from small intimate bars to large concert halls. Some more well-known venues include <b>Lee's Palace</b> (indie rock), <b>The Horseshoe Tavern</b> (harder rock), <b>The Danforth Music Hall</b> (pop and indie), <b>The Dakota Tavern</b> (country and folk), and <b>Massey Hall</b> (established, older acts), among many, many others.</li>

<li><b>Walking</b>. Toronto has so many eclectic neighborhoods that a random walk is fascinating in its own right. You might start in the Downtown area and then try other neighborhoods around the city. You will also find that Toronto is "the city within a park", with miles and miles of parkland following the streams and rivers that flow through the city. <b>Edwards Gardens</b> and the <b>Toronto Botanical Gardens</b> in the neighborhood of <a href="/en/Toronto/North_York" title="Toronto/North York">North York</a> might be the place to start exploring this natural environment.<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.toronto.ca/parks/maps.htm">[58]</a>.

<p>Toronto has ample opportunities for shopping, and nearly any section of the city has unique places to shop:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Toronto/Yonge_Street" title="Toronto/Yonge Street">Yonge Street</a>, is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest street in the world.  It runs from the edge of the lake to about 1896 km north of the city, and the Yonge subway line runs right under the Street from King Street North to Finch Avenue. You can drive along this street if you want (give up trying to find parking), but the smart way to explore Yonge is on foot, with a subway day pass to whisk you between the spots you want to see.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li><b>South of Queen St. to the lake</b>, is mostly the financial district, with very little for tourists. If you want to have a good look at the skyscrapers of the financial district, walk west from the King subway station to the corner of King and Bay. This is the financial heart of the country; Canada's equivalent to New York's Wall Street.</li>
<li><b>From Queen St. to Bloor St.</b> is the busiest stretch. While some locals will hang out and shop here (mostly younger folks), many of the stores are limited to souvenirs or lower budget shopping. This is a pretty exciting place to be, and most visitors find this part of the city an interesting experience, even if the most refined shopping is found elsewhere.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li><b>Toronto Eaton Centre</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.torontoeatoncentre.com/home/index.ch2">[60]</a> A massive shopping mall on the West side of Yonge between Queen and Dundas Streets, The Eaton Centre is a Toronto landmark. Because of its downtown location and accessibility by subway, the mall tends to have a less-antiseptic feel than more remote suburban centres. This place is generally packed with people, an exciting mix of locals and visitors. The bottom level houses an impressive fountain, which is a nice place to take a rest and make a wish. If you're coming from a warm country during winter, a popular store with locals that work outdoors where you might find fairly-priced winter clothes is Mark's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.marks.com/">[61]</a> inside the mall.</li>
<li><b>Bloor St</b>. If you head West from the corner of Yonge and Bloor, you are in the most upscale of Toronto's shopping districts, <a href="/en/Toronto/Bloor-Yorkville" title="Toronto/Bloor-Yorkville">Yorkville</a> (see below). While not strictly on Yonge street, this area is easily accessible from the Yonge-Bloor subway station (you can also go to Bay station on the Bloor-Danforth subway line).</li>
<li><b>Bloor St. to Eglinton</b>. A bit sleepier than other parts of Yonge, and a long walk without too much shopping, but for those who want a proper urban hike (4 km), there's no reason to skip this stretch. The shopping is not as vibrant, but that's not to say there aren't sights to see. Of particular interest is the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, roughly halfway between St. Clair and Davisville subway stations. The subway route between Bloor and Eglinton is interesting as well, as much of it runs outside, and the view out the window of the train is enjoyable, so if it's shopping you want, take the train to Eglinton from Bloor.</li>
<li><b>Eglinton to Lawrence</b>. This stretch of Yonge is not as well known by tourists, and consequently more popular with locals. Surrounded by upper middle class and wealthier neighbourhoods, this is where you want to go to experience the energy of Yonge street, without the tourist traps. Take the subway to Eglinton station, and walk North. It is a 2 km walk (1.3 miles) from Eglinton to Lawrence, and there are hundreds of stores and restaurants on both sides of the street. If you can handle a 4 km walk, you can walk up to Lawrence on one side of the street, and then cross over and walk back. There's even a half kilometre North of Lawrence that you can cover, for a total of 5 km of continuous shops. Bring comfortable shoes!</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Toronto/Bloor-Yorkville" title="Toronto/Bloor-Yorkville">Yorkville</a>. The high-end shopping district of Toronto. Once a haven for Toronto's hippie population, it is located just north of Bloor and Bay Streets and is now home to many designer boutiques. During the annual Toronto Film Festival the area is "ground-zero" for celebrity watching.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Located a short walk West of the Eaton Centre is the city's <a href="/en/Toronto/Fashion_District" title="Toronto/Fashion District">fashion district</a> along Queen Street West, an area usually bustling with locals looking for the latest fashion in a variety of trendy stores. The stretch between University Ave and Spadina tends to be much more mainstream with an ever increasing number of chain stores, but it is still well worth the look. More offbeat choices can be found west of Spadina Ave stretching all the way into Parkdale (at least 2 km/ 1.4 miles). Take the University subway to Osgoode station and walk West.</li>
<li><span class="vcard" id="Kensington_Market"><span class="fn org">Kensington Market</span>,  (<span class="note directions">around College and Spadina. Take the Bloor-Danforth subway to Spadina station, and then take the Spadina streetcar South into Chinatown. Kensington Market is one block West of Spadina. You can get off anywhere between College and Dundas streets.</span>). <span class="hours">Saturday is a good time to go; some stores are closed on Sunday.</span>. <span class="description"> Once a centre of Jewish life but has morphed into the centre of Toronto's bohemian scene. Visitors will be assaulted by sounds and smells unlike anywhere else in the city, as narrow streets bustle with immigrants, punks, and yuppies alike. Stores include surplus shops, coffee houses, small restaurants (including vegetarian), clothing vendors, and record stores. Fish and fruit markets are also present in great numbers, and the area is experiencing a boom of South American food stalls of late. Several weekends throughout the summer are designated "car-free" by the city, but even on the average weekend this is a place to avoid with a car, as pedestrians tend to wander as they please.</span> </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Pacific Mall</b>, at Steeles and Kennedy in Markham, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pacificmalltoronto.com/">[62]</a>. The largest Chinese indoor mall in North America, and definitely worth a visit if you are interested in Asian-Canadian culture. Take any 53 bus from Finch subway station (it's a long bus ride!). About 45 minutes from downtown by car, well over an hour by transit. Also located close to Milliken GO station.</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="/en/Toronto/Chinatown" title="Toronto/Chinatown">Chinatown</a>. Centred at Dundas and Spadina, Toronto's Chinatown is a great way to sample a tiny bit of cities like Hong Kong, without spending the airfare. Vast crowds crush the sidewalks as vendors sell authentic Chinese and Vietnamese food, and not-so-authentic knock-offs. It is one of North America's largest Chinatowns, and with many shops aimed at tourists, it is a good place to pick up some unusual and inexpensive souvenirs. The area is also home to a growing number of Korean and Vietnamese shops and restaurants. Toronto's multicultural mosaic never stops evolving. For a complete tour, travel along Spadina (North/South) starting at College Street in the north or Queen Street in the south.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Yorkdale Shopping Centre</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.yorkdale.com/">[63]</a> A shopping centre located in the north of the city, accessible from Yorkdale subway station. This is a full-service, upscale mall with hundreds of stores, a mid-sized movie theatre, and a huge and recently upgraded food court containing everything from fast food to sit-down restaurants to sushi and espresso bars, as well as a glass-enclosed sunlit dining area with sofas and fireplaces and a walk-out, unenclosed balcony. Be advised that because of the quality of the shopping, it is always extremely busy, and is a popular hangout destination for the local youth scenes, ensuring that this is not ideal for a quiet, unhurried shopping excursion. Make use of the subway if possible on weekends, as locals pack the parking areas to capacity.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>The 'PATH' System</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.toronto.ca/path/">[64]</a>. Stretches from the Eaton Centre south to Union Station, an underground shopping mall has been created for all the commuters to get from Union Station to their offices and back without ever going outside. In a city of Toronto's summer heat and winter cold, this is essential.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Scarborough</b>. Kennedy Avenue from Lawrence Avenue East to Ellesmere Avenue is  a commercial district featuring dozens of independent furniture, electronic, houseware and computer businesses that all share some of the best deals the city has to offer, together with a couple of large electronic chains. It is often very congested on weekends by automobile, and many merchants lack adequate parking, but it is within walking distance of the Scarborough RT and there is bus service from the Kennedy subway station on the Danforth line. This is not really a destination for tourists, and it's quite a drive from the city centre, but if you're in the area, and want to do some discount shopping, there may be something here to suit your needs.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Vaughan Mills</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://vaughanmills.shopping.ca/cambridge/jsp/index_flash.jsp?mallid=vgm">[65]</a>. Big new shopping mall 6 km North of City of Toronto. It includes attractions such as LEGOLAND Discovery Center<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.legolanddiscoverycentre.ca/toronto/">[66]</a> and Lucky Strike Lanes<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bowlluckystrike.com/locations/canada/vaughan/">[67]</a>.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Microbrews</b> are ubiquitous across Ontario. These can be purchased at the brewery, Beer Store, LCBO, and many large grocery stores. They are also enjoyed at brewpubs.</li></ul>

</p><p>Most Canadians don't carry large amounts of cash for everyday use, relying on their credit cards, ATMs and direct debit cards. Personal checks are rarely accepted. While foreign currencies are not usually accepted anywhere, a small number of businesses will accept USD or GBP using a highly unfavourable exchange rate. Contactless payments are the norm across the city - cash is still used, but many businesses will accept only contactless debit or credit payments. Many businesses will also accept WePay and AliPay.  
</p>
<ul><li><b>ATM</b></li></ul>
<p>Interbank ATM exchange rates usually beat traveller's checks or exchanging foreign currency. Canadian ATM fees are low ($1.50 to $2 per transaction), but your home bank may charge another fee on top of that. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Credit Cards</b></li></ul>
<p>Visa, MasterCard, American Express and JCB cards are widely accepted in Canada. Credit cards can get you cash advances at bank ATMs, generally for a 3% surcharge. Beware: many US-based credit cards now convert foreign charges using highly unfavourable exchange rates and fees.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Changing Money</b></li></ul>
<p>Always change your money at a recognized bank or financial institution. Some hotels, souvenir shops and tourist offices exchange money, but their rates won't put a smile on your dial.
</p><p><b>American Express</b> (905-474-0870, 800-869-3016; www.americanexpress.com/canada) branches in Toronto only function as travel agencies and don't handle financial transactions.

<p>Toronto is generally considered to be one of North America's top food cities. As one of the most (if not the single most) multicultural cities in the world, Toronto has authentic cuisine from most of the world's cultural and ethnic groups. It is easy to eat out in Toronto and have a superb meal for cheap, while even the more distant neighbourhoods in the city frequently contain one or more ethnic grocers' with both local stock and freshly imported products and brands from all over the world. Since Toronto is a city of a wide variety of distinct neighbourhoods, there are excellent restaurants scattered across the city. Many of the trendiest and hottest restaurants in Toronto are located outside of the downtown core and visitors should be prepared to travel a short drive or transit trip to visit them.
</p><p>As a visitor is quickly bound to notice, Torontonians virtually subsist upon coffee and tea, and the city contains an extremely high density of cafés of all types, from affordable franchise locations, to classy bars, to trendy independently owned locales with idiosyncratic brews. An unguided walk through literally any part of the city will take one past many shops selling hot beverages, snacks, and light meals, oftentimes at a rate of several per city block. This makes it exceptionally convenient to fuel a long day of walking, shopping, and sightseeing, as a traveller is certain to be no more than a few minutes travel from a seat, a meal, and a hot drink.

<p>Surrounded by the extensive fertile farmlands of Southern Ontario, Toronto has an abundance of farmer's markets - one is happening, in season, almost every day. Several markets are year round, while others are seasonal, generally running from May to October.
</p>
<ul><li><b>St. Lawrence Market</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.stlawrencemarket.com/">[68]</a>. Has been bringing the freshest foods into the city for Torontonians and visitors alike since 1901. Located at Jarvis and Front, the St. Lawrence Market stretches over 2 buildings, the 'North Market' and the 'South Market' - and often over the section of Front street between them! The North Market is home to a Farmer's Market, open Saturdays year round. It features fresh vegetables in season, preserves, spices and herbs, and direct from the source foods, such as honey direct from the beekeeper or maple syrup from the people who tapped and boiled it, as well as quality Ontario wines. The South Market has over 50 specialty vendors, with a large seafood section, a dozen butchers, several bakeries, and three very extensive cheese shops. In the basement, there is also a specialty area for handcrafters, and an extensive foodcourt, with merchants often cooking food that they bought fresh that morning from upstairs. The South Market is open year round, Tue-Thu 8AM-6PM, Fri 8AM-7PM, Sat 5AM-5PM.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Riverdale Farm</b>, 201 Winchester Street, (<i>three blocks east of Parliament Street</i>), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.toronto.ca/parks/prd/facilities/complex/345/index.htm">[69]</a>. A year-round producing farm owned by the City of Toronto as part of its extensive park system, open daily for tours, education, and more 9AM-5PM.

Riverdale farm is a working farm, with barns and outdoor paddocks, and animals of all types. In an attempt to provide education about farming, the staff is approachable, and will discuss chores as they go through the daily tasks of keeping a farm running. Tours are available, or you can wander the 7.5 acres freely.</li></ul>

<ul><li>'<i>Cabbagetown</i>,' is a designated Historic District in the eastern half of the downtown core.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Baldwin Village</b>,  small section of Baldwin Street (<i>east of Spadina, north of Dundas</i>) has many small outdoor cafes ideal for summer lunches.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Chinatown</b>, now features many Vietnamese and Thai restaurants.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Hakka Food</b>, is a style of Chinese food that originated in India with the migrant Chinese of Kolkata. Also known as India-Style Chinese food, outside of India and certain Southeast Asian countries, Toronto is the only city in the world to have such a variety of Hakka Restaurants.</li></ul>
<ul><li>King Street between University Avenue and Spadina Avenue has many restaurants appealing to theatre goers.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Queen Street East between Empire and Leslie has a number of casual, trendy restaurants that match the vibe of Leslieville.</li></ul>
<ul><li>College Street to the east of Bathurst has a cheaper set of eclectic restaurants popular with university students from nearby University of Toronto.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Bayview Avenue south of Eglinton, is the location of some of Toronto's best French pastry shops.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Bloor Street to the west of Spadina in the Annex has a similar set of restaurants to College, with a particularly heavy concentration of budget-friendly Japanese restaurants.  Most restaurants here tend to be very laid back.  Continuing west on Bloor, past Bathurst, one heads into Koreatown which has a number of Korean restaurants.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Yorkville</b>, it's more about being seen than actually eating but there are a few hidden gems, and this area is famous for sightseeing celebrities.  Restaurants often charges premium for otherwise mediocre meals. Mere 1 subway stop away from Yorkville, a meal of similar size and quality can be purchased for nearly half the price.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The city's largest newspaper, the Toronto Star, once chose the Downsview Park Flea Market food court as the best in the city. Although it is open only on weekends and rather remote, it offers a variety of authentic food from Afghan to Trinidadian and lacks the chain restaurants that dominate the city's food courts. It is located north of downtown, but is accessible from the Downsview subway station on the Spadina line and shares space with over 400 independent retailers.</li></ul>

<p>The majority of nightlife in Toronto is centred on the appropriately named <a href="/en/Toronto/Clubland" title="Toronto/Clubland">Clubland</a> and in the <a href="/en/Toronto/Fashion_District" title="Toronto/Fashion District">fashion district</a> on Queen Street West. Nearly everywhere is packed to the brim with pubs and bars, but none so much as Adelaide and Queen Street in those districts. Clubs tend to operate on Richmond and Adelaide streets (both run east-west, 1 block apart); names change frequently, but the district keeps on going. Four other clubs of note outside this district: The mega club/ultra lounge Muzik Nightclub (by Exhibition Place), The (long-lasting) Phoenix (on Sherbourne), and the Docks (literally operating on part of Toronto's commercial port, but this place has an outstanding view of the city on warm summer nights, and boasts an extensive entertainment complex).
</p><p>Some of Toronto's newest and hottest nightclubs have opened up in the King Street West / Liberty Village area.  This area tends to attract a more mature (25+ years old) crowd; however this comes at a cost as drinks and admission into the venues are typically a bit more expensive here than in <a href="/en/Toronto/Clubland" title="Toronto/Clubland">Clubland</a>. For underground electronic music there's some several nightclubs bringing international DJ's such as Ryze, CODA and Populous. 
</p><p>Hip art and music oriented crowds tend to gravitate on the West side of the city, in neighbourhoods such as Queen West, Parkdale and the Junction. The hipsters hangout in the wide array of bars, galleries and clubs that dot the area - in particular Stones Place (mostly Indians and sometimes gay crowds),and the Drake and its poor cousin Gladstone Hotels. The same folks also frequent the Annex / Kensington Market Area of the city at night for club nights, casual drinks and art / music events. One of the main "corsos" of the city is <i>Little Italy</i>: College Street, between Bathurst and Ossington flows over with music, sidewalk cafes and excellent food and a crowd that enjoys the summer heat and the offerings. College Street, east of Bathurst, is home to many student hangouts, including Sneaky Dee's which is famous among locals for its nachos. The legal minimum drinking age is 19.
</p><p>Toronto is also home to a number of microbreweries.  These include Mill Street, Steam Whistle Pilsner, Cool, Amsterdam, Great Lakes, Junction Craft Brewing, Indie Ale House and Bellwoods Brewery.  The breweries offer free samples and some have restaurants and/or are brewpubs.  Although a tour of the Steam Whistle Brewery costs $10, it includes a gift.

<p>Homestays are an ideal option for mid-term stays of a few months, or for newcomers who need a few months of accommodation while searching for a place to rent. Homestays are very popular for ESL students, often coming from South Korea, Japan, China, and Brazil. It's estimated that there are hundreds of homestays in Toronto, usually in the price range of $750 to $900 per month, and including home-cooked meals. Payments are typically made in cash. Homestays are often listed in online indexes, presented in a manner much like selecting a hotel.

<p>International students often prefer to study in Toronto because of its safety, proximity to other tourist destinations, and favourable exchange rates and visa policies. However, despite its status as the largest city in the country and Canada's economic centre, it is surprisingly under-served by universities. This lack of post-secondary education has led to the development of major universities in the mid-sized cities that surround Toronto: the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University in <a href="/en/Waterloo_(Ontario)" title="Waterloo (Ontario)">Waterloo</a>, the University of Guelph in <a href="/en/Guelph" title="Guelph">Guelph</a>, Brock University in <a href="/en/St._Catharines" title="St. Catharines">St. Catharines</a> and Trent University in <a href="/en/Peterborough_(Ontario)" title="Peterborough (Ontario)">Peterborough</a>. The universities in Toronto remain some of the best in the country:
</p>
<ul><li><b>The University of Toronto</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.utoronto.ca">[72]</a>. Canada's largest university, is spread out all over the city (including the main downtown campus, an East-end Scarborough campus, and University of Toronto at Mississauga (UTM) in the neighbouring city of <a href="/en/Mississauga" title="Mississauga">Mississauga</a>). This university is consistently rated among the top three in the country and is part of the "Canadian Ivy League." Due to its size, the University of Toronto's downtown campus, known as the St George campus, after the street that runs through it, has its own "sphere of influence," turning the surrounding neighbourhoods into miniature college towns, with plenty of bars, restaurants, bookshops, grocery stores and cheap take-out joints.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>York University</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.yorku.ca">[73]</a>. The third largest university in Canada, is on the northern border of the city, though the original Glendon College campus at Bayview and Lawrence is still in existence. Its location is the main drawback to this university; while it is located within the bounds of the city itself, it nevertheless functions as a commuter school for all intents and purposes as the vast majority of attending students either travel southwards from outer regions or northwards from deeper in the city. York University got its own subway station on the Yonge-University TTC line in 2017, and is now the easiest way to get right on campus by public transportation. There is also a regular bus - route 106 - that connects Downsview subway station on the northern end of the Yonge-University-Spadina line to the bus loop at the centre of the campus. More conveniently, there is a regular express bus - route 196 - that takes 'bus only' lanes for quick access to Downsview Subway station.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ryerson University</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ryerson.ca">[74]</a>. In the heart of the downtown core. It was once a polytechnic, but is now Toronto's third university. The university is particularly well known for its school of management, as well as its journalism program. Its campus is centred on the Kerr Hall, which forms a square around a central quad, it fills the block bounded by Gould, Gerrard, Victoria and Church streets. Ryerson also has buildings throughout this section of the city, including the Ted Rogers School of Management, at Bay and Dundas streets.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Ontario College of Art and Design</b>, Queen Street West and Spadina.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Seneca College</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.senecac.on.ca">[75]</a>. Canada's largest college is spread out over the city with over 16 campuses of varying sizes.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>George Brown College</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gbrownc.on.ca">[76]</a>. Two campuses: St. James (downtown) and Casa Loma (midtown).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Humber College</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.humber.ca">[77]</a>. Two campuses: Lakeshore and North.</li></ul>
<p>Toronto, like other Canadian cities, also has dozens of <b>English as a Second Language</b> (ESL) schools. The largest association of private English and French language schools is the Canadian Association of Private Language Schools <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.capls.com">[78]</a>.

<p><b>Calling</b>
</p><p>For an emergency, dial 911 (you can dial it at the pay phone without inserting any coins).
</p><p>Local calls from a pay phone cost 50 cents and are not metered, so you can talk as long as you want. Due to the popularity of mobile phones, street pay phones have slowly disappeared. However, most of the large public facilities still offer ample pay phones and they are usually located between the inner and outer doors at the entrances in shopping malls.
</p><p>Further, many public facilities (such as shopping malls) now offer phones providing free local calls, and are funded by advertisements run on colour LCD screens. Watch for large, wall-mounted ovals in high-traffic areas.
</p><p>As a visitor, it's also possible to purchase a pay-as-you-go SIM card for your GSM phone. There is no shortage of mobile phone shops and visiting 3-4 different shops should give you an idea of what's available.
</p><p>Toronto now has 3  area codes: 416,437, and 647. These area codes overlap. That is, they are all associated with the same geographic area. The suburban areas outside of the city also have three overlapping area codes, 905,365 and 289. As a result, Toronto has <b>10-digit local dialing</b>. You must always dial the area code as part of the number you are trying to reach.
</p><p>International calling cards are widely available in convenience stores and offer reasonable rates.

<p>Toronto is a city with many internet cafés, especially on Yonge Street around Bloor, and also on Bloor Street between Spadina and Bathurst. It's not hard to find a place to call home and the costs range from $3 for 30 minutes. The widespread availability of high-speed internet access means that internet cafes are largely becoming a thing of the past, so on repeat visits to the city, you may find that the one you used last time has disappeared. Most major hotels offer high-speed internet in their rooms and in their business centres. In addition, most independent coffee shops in Toronto offer free Wi-Fi for their customers, as do the major chains such as <b>Tim Horton's</b>, <b>Second Cup</b>, <b>Starbucks</b>.
</p><p>Cogeco operates a public WiFi network called <b>One Zone</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.onezone.ca">[79]</a> that covers six square kilometres in the downtown core. Rates are $4.99 for one hour, $9.99 for a day, or $24.99 for a month.
</p><p>The TTC offers free WiFi in many downtown subway stations. Look for the "tconnect" network. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.ttc.ca/Customer_Service/Station_WiFi/index.jsp">[80]</a> Free WiFi is also offered at most GO Transit stations and bus terminals. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.gotransit.com/public/en/travelling/wifi.aspx">[81]</a>
</p><p>Free internet access is available on computers at <b>Toronto Public Library</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tpl.toronto.on.ca">[82]</a> branches, and the <b>Toronto Reference Library</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/hou_az_trl.jsp">[83]</a> also provides free wireless access on the first two floors.

<p>Unlike in much the rest of the English speaking world, the 2007 Recession was not as devastating to the newspaper business in Canada as it was to many other venerable organs such as <i>The New York Times</i> or the <i>Times of London</i>. While business and readership have declined notably, the signature papers of Canadian record have not shown the same sudden catastrophic losses, and newspapers in Toronto are stocked in most places, with paper advertising still considered a "must buy" for some companies.
</p><p>Papers such as the following are still considered to be standby sources of the day-to-day news, regularly breaking substantive stories first with highly respected pieces of investigative journalism, and purchasing a paper for a dollar (or two for the weekend editions) in order to read the day's events does not carry the same old-fashioned air it does elsewhere, especially in the States:
</p>
<ul><li><b>The Toronto Star</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thestar.com/">[84]</a>, a major daily newspaper, covering local, national, and world news with a liberal point of view. Generally the most widely read by Torontonians and within the Greater Toronto Area, and available almost literally everywhere as a result. Strongly identified with the city itself and its culture.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>The Toronto Sun</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.torontosun.com/">[85]</a>, a tabloid-style newspaper, covering local, national, and world news. Tends toward sensationalism in reporting, and features the "Sunshine Girl" pin-ups. Styles itself as a populist voice.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>The Globe and Mail</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/">[86]</a>, a national daily, published in Toronto, with ties to Bay Street banks. Well-respected like The Star, though with less focus on metropolitan Toronto and more on national affairs, its relative popularity is lesser inside the city than outside.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>The National Post</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nationalpost.com/">[87]</a>, a national daily, also published in Toronto and often more right-leaning than The Globe and Mail.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Metro</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.metronews.ca/toronto">[88]</a>, a free daily, with brief articles covering local, national, and world news, distributed on the street and in subway stations.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>24hrs</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.toronto.24hrs.ca">[89]</a>, a free daily, with brief articles covering local, national, and world news, distributed on the street and in subway stations.</li></ul>
<p>Free weekly newspapers, distributed from boxes on street corners and in racks in stores and restaurants can be good sources of information on cinema, dining, music, theatre, and other events and local news:
</p>
<ul><li><b> Now</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nowtoronto.com">[90]</a> - Comes out on Thursdays.</li></ul>
<p>Depending on where you go in Toronto, you will be able to find locally printed newspapers in a variety of languages. For example, in Chinatown, you will find Chinese newspapers. In "Little Italy", you'll find Italian newspapers. You'll also find newspapers in Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, Arabic, Tagalog, Greek and more.
</p><p>Other alternative weeklies include the popular <b>Xtra!</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.xtra.ca/toronto.aspx">[91]</a>, which reports for Toronto's large and active LGBT community.

<p>Toronto is remarkably safe and the streets are vibrant with pedestrians and bicyclists, even in most neighbourhoods at night. If you use common sense, you should have no trouble at all.
</p><p>That said, crime has increased on the TTC (Toronto's transit system), akin to other transit systems in North America. One should mind one's own business, and in the worst case scenario, flee and use the emergency buttons available in stations and all vehicles.
</p><p>The overall violent crime rate in Canada, and particularly in Toronto, is much lower than the large cities of the United States and below the average of other large Canadian cities to the west. Over the last decade, there have been an average of fewer than 70 homicides per year in the city, a rate of fewer than three per 100,000. Organized gang violence occurs but has been very sporadic since a noticeable rise mid-last decade. Petty crime is generally not a large-scale problem in Toronto, but as always, keep vigilant with your possessions and avoid keeping valuables in outer pockets. Car and bike theft are comparable to other large North American cities and many stolen automobiles wind up being exported overseas.
</p><p>Some neighbourhoods are known in the media and on the street as being more dangerous, but police statistics evaluate crime in a given area based occurrences per 10,000 residents, not including incoming non-resident traffic. The Bay Street financial downtown core actually experiences the highest rate of assault and drug crimes using these parameters, but this has not been well publicized by local or national media. Higher than average crime (compared with the city overall) does occur in certain neigbourhooods. These include:
</p>
<ul><li>Areas in the old city (close to or downtown): Regent Park, parts of Parkdale, St. James Town, Cabbagetown and Moss Park, Alexandra Park, Danforth East. Former Inner Boroughs: Crescent Town, Pakview-O'Connor, Flemingdon Park, Weston-Mount Dennis and Lambton.</li>
<li>Outer areas in North York: Jane &amp; Finch ("Jane Corridor"), Lawrence Heights, Westminster-Branson, the Peanut (Don Mills/Sheppard).</li>
<li>Etobicoke: Rexdale/Jamestown Cresent and Long Branch.</li>
<li>Scarborough: Malvern, Kingston &amp; Galloway, Steeles-L'Amoreaux, Dorset Park, and Eglinton East-Kennedy Park.</li></ul>

<p>Parts of Toronto have a visible homeless population, many of whom will ask you for money. This can be a bit startling for newcomers from outside North America. You do not need to give them money and can simply say “no, sorry” or ignore them. They nearly always leave you alone. There have been occasional occurrences of aggressive homeless people, with one resulting in a fatality. If a person becomes aggressive, move away quickly and alert a police officer.

<p>Be careful when getting off the streetcars and look always to your right before leaving the car. Although vehicles are supposed to stop when the streetcar doors open, some motorists and cyclists will ignore this and keep going.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weather">Weather</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Toronto&amp;action=edit&amp;section=50" title="Edit section: Weather">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Avoid river/creek banks or bridge underpasses during periods of excessive rain, during/after heavy thundershowers or melting snow. Recent flooding can soften soil and cause it to suddenly collapse into the water under any weight.
</p><p>Occasionally, Toronto will be hit with a severe winter storm accompanied by significant snowfall (quite often mixed with freezing rain, ice, or sleet). Avoid driving during and immediately after the storms if at all possible. This is especially true for those unfamiliar with winter driving and controlling a car in a skid. Take public transit, walk, or stay inside.
