<p><b>Dubai</b> (<b>دبي</b>) is one of the seven emirates that make up the <a href="/en/United_Arab_Emirates" title="United Arab Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>. With a shape like a slanted rectangle, it's bounded in the north by <a href="/en/Sharjah" title="Sharjah">Sharjah</a> and in the south by <a href="/en/Abu_Dhabi" title="Abu Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</a>. The city is rather like an independent city-state and is the most modern and progressive emirate in the UAE, developing at a rapid pace, especially in the tourist and trade sectors.

<p>It is essentially a desert climate city with many infrastructures and comparatively liberal policies (by regional standards). Boasting state-of-the-art tourist amenities, it quickly became popular and one of the most visited cities in the world. Just 5 h from <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> and 3 h from most parts of the Middle East, the Near East, and the subcontinent of India, Dubai makes a great short break for shopping, partying, sunbathing, fine dining, sporting events, and other tourists' activities. It is a city of superlatives. For the fastest, biggest, tallest, largest and highest, Dubai is the destination. It has the largest immigrant population in the world. Specifically, according to Dubai Statistics Center, out of its 3,355,900 population, only 263,450 were Emiratis and that has been the fashion for years.
The city's weekly day off is Friday. Note that since September 2006, a harmonized weekend of Friday and Saturday has been adopted for the public sector and schools. Government departments, multinational companies, and most schools and universities now go off on Friday and Saturday (after years of a mixed bag of Friday/Saturday and Thursday/Friday weekends). Some local companies still work half a day on Thursday with a full day on Saturday, but larger companies tend to permit relaxation and time off work for their employees on Friday and Saturday.

<p><b>One Emirates, many Peoples</b><br />
Once you land in Dubai, you might not think it is an Arab city, given its cosmopolitan feel and its modern Western-styled architecture. When Dubai was in a poor state before the exploration of oil, some Indians supplied technology for its development of it. Dubai has, since the founding of its oil industry, attracted thousands of migrants from all over the world notably from <a href="/en/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/en/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/en/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, and the <a href="/en/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. In this modern day, Indians and Filipinos have left their influence in the emirate: Indian restaurants and Pakistani bakeshops are everywhere while Filipino supermarkets are on the rise. Next to them the Europeans (mostly British and French) and Sri Lankans, form the next largest communities.  Chinese and Indonesian migrants are on the rise. Many Arab countries have passed policies like the UAE's <i>Emiratisation</i>, which is a policy that prevents migrants from taking <i>all</i> the job opportunities and provides more jobs to local Emiratis.

<p><br />
Dubai is divided into multiple districts or municipalities: 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Jumeirah</b> — A diverse district whose residents are the Europeans to the Filipinos to the Pakistanis; a mixed <i>Little Europe, Karachi and Manila</i>. Jumeirah is much favored by Europeans due to the ease of access to the beach, Beautiful villas are seen here. Jumeirah Beach, Jumeirah Beach Residence's Walk, and Jumeirah Mosque are the top attractions.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Downtown Dubai</b> — While Bur Dubai and Deira are traditionally considered "Downtown", the Downtown Dubai development is smack in the center of the "New Dubai," between Dubai Marina on the south end and the border with the city of Sharjah to the north. It includes the Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world), the Dubai Mall (the world's biggest), the Dubai Fountain, and lots of other skyscrapers and hotels.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Dubai Harbour</b> —  Set to open in October 2020, Dubai Harbour will be an iconic, innovative and luxurious waterfront development, creating a world-class maritime facility with the biggest and most advanced cruise terminal and marina in the region. Inspired by the Gulf’s long tradition with the sea, Dubai Harbour is set to further enhance the position of Dubai as a leading global hub for maritime tourism, attracting visitors from all over the world. Located right in the heart of Dubai, in the vibrant area between the iconic Bluewaters and Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Harbour is a stone’s throw away from the city’s most recognized landmarks, beautiful beaches, and world-famous attractions.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Dubai Marina</b> — is a mega-development that borders Jebel Ali (the world's largest man-made port). It is full of skyscrapers and hosts the "Jumeirah Beach Walk" with a number of restaurants, hotels an open-air market when the weather permits, and frequent shows. Dubai Marina houses one of the highest concentrations of Westerns in Dubai. There are many hotels surrounding Dubai Marina.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Satwa</b> — One of Dubai's <i>Little India</i> and <i>Little Manila</i>, due to the presence of Filipinos and Indians, a rise in Filipino and Indian restaurants, shops, and supermarkets is seen here. Gold and textiles are what people come here for, Gold Souk might be your top destination but Satwa too has gold shops and is hassle-free, not so crowded.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Karama</b> — More of like a mixed commercial-residential district, one of Dubai's <i>Little India</i>s and Little Manila's, cheap eats and cheap buys are the top things here.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bur Dubai</b> — A historical district and Bur Dubai is usual term for the area from Jumeirah to the creek, the creek separates Bur Dubai from Deira. Tourist attractions from <i>abras</i> to souks to floating restaurants to the famous creek are found here.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bluewaters</b> — is a vibrant lifestyle destination featuring distinctive residential, retail, hospitality, and entertainment options. All who arrive are spoilt for choice. Home to <b>Ain Dubai</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://mala.ae/dubai/places-to-visit/ain-dubai-tickets/">[1]</a>, the world’s largest observation wheel, it is also a shopper’s paradise, housing unique retail and dining concepts.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Dubai World Trade Centre</b>- a district that was only sand and emptiness only a decade ago but is now a free zone of commercial economic activity, from office spaces, coworking spaces, and entertainment attractions, to warehouses, expensive hotels, and lavish restaurants.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Deira</b> — Dubai's old Financial center, today Deira is a bustling commercial-residential district of Indian, Pakistani, Persian, and Arab cultures with some old souks, including one specializing in spices. Many Iranian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Pakistani, Indian, Afghani, and other immigrants from poorer Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Central Asian countries call this area home.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Arabian Ranches</b> and <b>Emirates Hills</b> — These are two separate places, residential rents here are expensive due to the land value, just like the whole of Dubai, these two are Man-made.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Mirdiff or Mirdif</b> — A commercial-residential district that is somewhat newly built and lies directly under the flight path to Dubai International Airport. Mirdif City Center is one of the attractions. This is another residence for the well-to-do.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>International City</b> — Just a simple residential area in the middle of the desert, what's special about it is its architectural design, the residential rents here are cheap, and is somewhat the next <i>Chinatown</i> as many Chinese businessmen and women reside here.</li></ul>
<p>Also see <b>Jebel Ali</b>, a city near Dubai that was once isolated from the main bulk of Dubai back in the 70s and is now a separate major residential and industrial hub encompassing the edges of the southern portions of Dubai. The main attraction popular with locals and tourists alike is the easily recognizable Ibn Battuta Mall, styled on the countries visited by the famous explorer. The mall is built adjacent to the Ibn Battuta Gate Hotel that's large archway can be seen from afar. Surrounding the mall is the Gardens apartments, an ethnically diverse district with a strong Indian community. Jebel Ali village, a 35-year-old community built on the side of Jebel Ali (Ali Mountain) for the European builders of Jebel Ali Port is still popular with western ex-pats. The coastal side of the Sheihk Zayed Road in Jebel Ali consists of many unattractive power and desalination plants that somewhat ruin the view. The port was the 9th busiest in the world in 2011.

<p>Especially after the launch of the metro, Dubai's public transport system is probably the best in the Middle East, but it's still a very car-oriented city and most visitors end up taking taxis quite often. The <b>Wojhati</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://wojhati.rta.ae/">[2]</a> journey planner can suggest the best way to travel.
</p><p>A daily pass valid for unlimited rides on the metro and buses for all zones costs Dh22, while the <b>Nol Silver</b> stored-value card costs Dh25 (including Dh19 worth of balance) and gives a 10% discount on both metro and bus fares.  Both are available at metro stations and major bus stations. The Silver card is useful for public transport users who are planning on taking more than 6 trips on any of the services during their stay. After 6 trips, one starts saving money compared to the Red ticket due to the 10% discount.

<p>Dubai's 52-km long <b>Red Line</b>, opened in September 2009, is the third metro in the Arab world after <a href="/en/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> and <a href="/en/Algiers" title="Algiers">Algiers</a>.  As of May 15, 2010, 21 stations are open and the rest are scheduled to open by the end of the year.  While the line does not serve the old city center, it's handy for zipping along Dubai's Sheikh Zayed Road and includes stops at the airport, Burj Khalifa and the Mall of the Emirates.  The <b>Green Line</b>, which burrows through the city core, has been open as of September 9, 2011. Transfers are possible at Union and Burjuman. There are also Blue and Purple lines under construction with opening dates in the next few years.
</p><p>Single tickets range from Dh2-8.50, or double that for use of the "Gold" first-class carriage.  The train runs every 3-5 minutes from 5:50 AM to Midnight every day except Thursday and Friday, when services are extended to 5:50 AM to 1 AM and limited to 1 PM to Midnight, respectively.  All stations are air-conditioned and there's a large network of feeder buses. Trains run every 2 minutes during morning and evening rush hour.

<p>In addition, a 5 km monorail system shuttles passengers across the Palm Jumeirah to the Atlantis hotel, but it's not yet connected to the metro network and is thus of very limited utility. The normal metro ticket does NOT work on this line. A monorail ticket costs 20 AED one way and 30 round trips. The station only accepts cash and there is no ATM at the station. If you are more than one person, it is cheaper to take Uber or Taxi to Palm Jumeirah as opposed to taking a monorail.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_tram">By tram</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dubai&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: By tram">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>The Dubai Tram links Dubai Marina with the Burj Al Arab and JBR. The tram interchanges with Jumeirah Lakes Towers Station and Dubai Marina Station of the Dubai Metro's Red Line and two more metro stations are expected to connect with the tram in the future.
</p><p>Services operate every six minutes from 06:30 to 01:30. On Fridays, the service starts at 09:00. The tram has a fixed fare of AED 3 per ride regardless of the distance traveled. A Nol Card can be used by passengers to check in and check out of the tram by scanning the card at the platform screen doors.

<p>Dubai has an extensive public bus network which is a cheaper means of traveling within the several districts in Dubai. A map of the bus system can be found online, as well as detailed route maps and timetables <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rta.ae/wpsv5/links/publictransportpdf.htm">[3]</a>. Public buses are clean and cheap, but unfortunately not very comprehensive and (on some routes) quite infrequent. The bus system is most useful for getting between different areas of central Dubai, or between the various suburbs, rather than general transport. Taxis or a fair amount of walking will also be required if you wish to visit Dubai without a car of your own.
</p><p>You will require a Nol card or ticket for fare payment. Cards could be purchased from most bus stations, metro stations, and sometimes from the bus driver.
</p><p>The main bus stations are Gold Souq Market (in Deira) and Al Ghubaiba bus station (in Bur Dubai). The flat fare is 2 AED, but might be higher for hour-long rides to distant suburbs. Clear route maps and timetables are placed inside a few bus stands. Ramadan timings differ. The front seats are reserved for women. 
</p><p>Probably the single most useful service for the casual tourist is <b>Line 8</b>, which starts at the Gold Souq, takes the tunnel under the Creek to Heritage Village, and then sets off down Jumeirah Rd (just behind the beach) and all its hotels and malls, up to Burj al-Arab and Wild Wadi. Line 8 terminates near the Internet City, while its 8A variant goes down a little further and also serves the Mall of the Emirates.
</p><p>For a good, hop on - hop off, type tour try the Big Bus Company<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.bigbustours.com/en/dubai/dubai-bus-tours/">[4]</a>. It runs two routes; the blue route through Jumeirah and the recently constructed areas, and the red route centering on the older parts of Dubai. The hub for both routes is Wafi City mall, and a 175 AED ticket covers 24 hours of riding.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="By_taxi">By taxi</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dubai&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: By taxi">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Taxis roam the streets of Dubai and are relatively easy to spot. The easiest place to find them is at the taxi queue at one of the malls or outside a hotel. Waving down a taxi on the road is possible, but can be difficult during rush hours. At peak times (7-9AM &amp; 4-7PM workdays, and Friday evenings) demand far exceeds supply, and not only are taxis hard to find, but those who design to pick you up may demand crazy off-meter fares or refuse short rides in congested areas entirely.  The standard of driving in Dubai ranges from poor to wild - taxis are some of the worst on the roads.  Taxi drivers are pretty good at knowing where the main shopping malls and hotels are, however, less well-known places will mean the driver calling his brother-in-law to get directions, whilst he drives around in circles on your time - hence it is a good idea to have a rough idea of where you are heading or what a nearby landmark is. It also helps to know exactly what place you are going to rather than to ask for the nearest whatever-it-is (hotel, Metro stop, etc.), as they might drive farther in order to charge you a higher fare.
</p><p>Taxis<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.dubaitaxi.ae/en/Our-Services/Taxi">[5]</a> are metered at 2.19 dhs/km, so no haggling is necessary.  The rates of all taxi companies &#8212; Dubai Transport, National, Cars, Metro, and Arabian &#8212; are identical, so just take the first one that comes along.  From the airport, there is a standing charge of 25 dhs; all other street pickups attract a standing charge of 5.00 dhs during the day, 5.50 at night (10 PM-6AM), but a minimum fare of 10 dhs applies, and there is a surcharge of 20 dhs for going to <a href="/en/Sharjah" title="Sharjah">Sharjah</a>.  Taxis are not exempt from the Salik road toll charges which cost an additional 4 Dh (since January 1st, 2013).  Beware of unmarked hotel taxis and limousines though: while some of these are metered, they are <i>not</i> tied to the official rates, and can be much more expensive. One way to spot whether a taxi is official or not is to look for a meter: no meter, don't get in.
</p><p>If you can't find one otherwise, you can attempt to call a taxi at 04-2080808, there's a surcharge of 3 dhs to book. The booking system was notorious for its unreliability but with a significantly increased taxi fleet, many taxis now deliberately wait in unofficial holding areas waiting for bookings. As a result, on a good day, it can be possible to book a taxi and have it arrive within less than five minutes. If you absolutely have to get somewhere at a certain time (say, the airport or a meeting), it's still best to book a hotel taxi in advance, <i>and</i> get their estimate of how bad the traffic will be.
</p><p>Solo women are advised to travel in the back of the taxi as some drivers see it as a sexual invitation if they get in the front.

<p>There are countless Rent-A-Cars that will provide a mode of transportation for very cheap rates and very little paperwork. An International Driving Permit is not necessarily required, but hire companies may not rent a car without one (is not required only for major European and gulf countries, however strictly required for other countries like Russia, etc., according to RTA).
</p><p>Some agencies will hire cars complete with drivers. Visitors taking advantage of this option will need to make certain that their driver knows his way around as many do not.
</p><p>When driving on the main roads, such as Sheikh Zayed road, the junction numbers are not in logical order. Junction 13 is just after Junction 18 and are rarely as shown on the maps. Road names can also be very confusing with slight differences in spelling (due to different transliterations from Arabic) being very important. The construction work that is taking place throughout and around Dubai can make finding your destination a challenge. Temporary road layouts change with alarming regularity and temporary signs can be misleading or non existent. As GPS maps are not up to date (and usually not anyway available to rent with hire cars), you will be very well off with a printed map (you can get an excellent one in Virgin stores, for example. There is a Virgin Megastore on the top floor of City Center).
</p><p>Driving during morning and afternoon peak hours is not recommended, as traffic slows to a standstill and even a simple trip across a bridge can take up to 45 minutes. There is also a scarcity of parking spaces in many parts of the city.
</p><p>With such a mixture of nationalities residing in the city, driving styles are mixed to say the least. Both dangerous and experienced driving will be witnessed or experienced frequently, and bear in mind that Dubai has one of the highest per capita road death rates in the world. There is zero tolerance for alcohol and driving with stiff penalties meted out including jail and deportation.
</p><p><b>Note on Navigation systems:</b> In case you are renting a car, you definitely want a navigation system. Even people living there need GPS. For this, you have 2 options: You can rent a GPS or get a car with a navigation system. Or you can get data service with your smartphone and use Google Maps or other navigation systems on smartphones.

<p>An easier way of crossing Dubai Creek is by <i>abra</i>, essentially a small ferry. Abra stations are located along the Creek on both the Bur Dubai and Deira sides, and the system of filling the boats is remarkably efficient. The cross-river trip costs 1 Dirham (AED 1) per passenger, payable to the driver after the boat has left the station, and affords <i>a very picturesque view of the city</i> (not to be missed). Abras set off very regularly, and the service is available.
</p><p>Abras can also be hired for a private tour. This is quite a popular activity at sunset on a clear day, particularly if the driver is able to enliven the tour with stories about the structures on either side of the Creek. 
</p><p>The RTA(Roads and Transport Authority of Dubai) Abra is another option for tourists who want to go by boat but avoid the abra crowd (or the heat). It is a part of Dubai's public transport system, and Nol card and online payment methods are being introduced for the journey. Can be purchased at the RTA Marine stations along the Creek at Baniyas, Al Sabkha, Deira Old Souq, Al Seef, Al Fahidi, Dubai Old Souq, Bur Dubai, and Al Ghubaiba Stations.
</p><p>The Dubai Ferry also features 'touristic routes' - a round trip or a point-to-point journey along the coastal attractions of Dubai- it is convenient, smooth, and safe. The tickets for a 1 hour 40 minutes trip cost only AED 50 (Silver class) and AED 75 (Gold Class) for an adult. Also, the Dubai canal has Water Bus and Abra services at only AED 2 per stop! An economical way to see the man-made canal!!
</p><p>The Creek is also the home of many boats offering more comfortable (and correspondingly more expensive) tours, often in boats designed to resemble dhows. Along with the creek, Dubai marina also has its own Luxury Dinner boats and modern dhow cruises. Prices tend to be higher, particularly for dinner cruises with onboard entertainment.

<li><b>Bastakiya District</b>. One of the last remaining pockets of <i>Old Dubai</i>, home to many reconstructed buildings in the traditional style.

<li><b>Dubai Museum</b>, Al Ibn Abi Talib Road, ph: <i>+971</i> (4) 353-1862. A must-see for anyone interested in the social history of the Emirate (and indeed the country). A visit starts at the al-Fahidi fort, which has a few examples of traditional reed houses and other artifacts but isn't much to look at.  The more interesting part is the modern extension built <i>underneath</i> the fort, showcasing Dubai's history using the latest technology and culminating in a reconstructed souq from the pearling days, complete with authentic sights and sounds.  It is quite fascinating to see the speed at which the transition from a poor pearling village to a modern metropolis occurred.  Admission 3AED.</li>
<li><b>Jumeirah Mosque</b>, Jumeirah Road, Jumeirah 1 (<i>opposite Palm Strip Mall</i>). Is the largest in the city, and a wonderful example of Islamic architecture. Built-in the medieval Fatimid tradition the interior is decorated with elaborate Arabic calligraphy. It is one of few mosques in the city open for visits by non-Muslims, the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding conducts special tours for non-Muslims to help promote understanding of Islam. Guided tours are available on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday beginning at 10AM, followed by a question-and-answer session. Located on Jumeirah Road, the mosque is an especially great place to visit in the evening when it's dramatically illuminated by floodlights.</li>

<ul><li><b>Burj al-Arab hotel</b>. For a real glimpse into "how the other half lives", (often referred to as 'seven stars' but is actually five-star deluxe),  afternoon tea or cocktails may be an interesting experience. Entry to the hotel requires a reservation which will be confirmed at the entry gate,  although residents of adjacent Jumeirah hotels may be able to visit by arrangement. Other tourists may occasionally be able to book tours of the hotel itself, however, these will not run when the hotel is full. A "very smart casual" dress code applies.

<li><b>Burj Khalifa</b>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/observation/">[8]</a>.

The observation deck on the 124th floor is the 2nd highest in the world after the Shanghai World Financial center. Already dominating the Dubai skyline, the newly opened tower houses nine hotels and a Las Vegas-inspired fountain system. The visitors' entrance is located on the lower ground floor of <b>Dubai Mall</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thedubaimall.com/en/Index.aspx">[9]</a>. Although the tour is called <b>At the Top</b> be aware that it isn't!  Although the observation deck is the highest open deck in the world, at 452m it's just over halfway up the tower itself.  Console yourself with the knowledge that most of the rest of the tower consists of service areas and the view below looks suitably ant-like.  Tickets cost Dhs 125 for a timed entry ticket, usually later the same day, or Dhs 400 if you do not want to wait. Tickets can sell out several days in advance, and it is advisable to book them online ahead of your visit.</li>
<li><b>Dubai Fountain</b>. At 270m (900ft) in length and sporting a jet that shoots water up to 150m (500 ft), the Dubai Fountain is indeed the world's largest dancing fountain and one with a very enticing display - a definite must-see. The show starts every evening at the Burj Dubai Lake. An easy way to approach it is via the Dubai Mall. Shows are every 30 minutes from 6pm to 10pm on weekdays and from 6pm to 11pm on weekends. It's the world’s largest dancing fountain with classical, Arabic, and world music. About 1.5 million lumens of projected light and spray heights of up to 150m/500 ft (22,000 gallons of airborne water).</li>
<li><b>Dubai Marina</b>. Established in 2003. The construction of the Marina was inspired by the development of False Creek in Vancouver (Canada). One of the newer and more popular areas of Modern Dubai, both with residents and tourists. It offers numerous features such as a phenomenal skyline, world-class hotels, a fabulous beach, a mall, and 2 different walkways (The Walk and Marina Walk) with coffee shops, restaurants, and shops. Marina Walk is right on the "Marina water", and there are many yachts there. You can rent a yacht for a cruise around the area or you can simply dine on a dhow cruise Dubai<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.arabiansafaridubai.com/product/dhow-cruise-dubai-creek/">[10]</a>. The Walk has a nice open market run from October till May, every Friday and Saturday at daylight.</li>
<li><b>Dubai Water Canal</b> Dubai water canal is a new tourist attraction unveiled in Dubai, which is another golden feather in the cap of Dubai's history. The 3.2-kilometer-long canal serves as the final segment of the Dubai Creek extension, terminating in the Arabian Gulf via Al Safa, Al Wasl and Jumeirah 2. The opening of the canal opens up new possibilities in marine transport, connecting the historic areas of Deira and Bur Dubai through the extended waterway of Dubai Creek, Business Bay, and Dubai Water Canal. There are 3 pedestrian bridges created across different areas of the canal in order for the public to watch the beauty of the canal and its artificial waterfall with its full essence. The waterfalls automatically stop and give way to marine transport when it passes across it. You can experience cruising through this canal by booking a rental service or by using an RTA water taxi.</li>
<li><b>Palm Islands</b>. The three largest artificial islands in the world are located just off the coast of Dubai; a major urban development to add a significant amount of upscale beachfront property to the area. Each of the islands is shaped like a palm leaf, with a trunk connected to the mainland, fronds extending from the trunk, and a crescent (a breakwater encircling the trunk and fronds). Of the three planned, the Palm Jumeirah, at 5km square and near Dubai Marina, is the only one yet open, connected to the mainland by a freeway bridge and a monorail and sporting marinas, luxury resorts, and upscale shopping areas.</li>
<li><b>Palm Tower</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.palmtowerdubai.com">[11]</a>. Palm-shaped skyscraper in Palm Jumeirah. An observation deck on level 52 offers great views over Palm Island and Dubai. Also including a hotel St. Regis The Palm.</li></ul>

<ul><li><span class="vcard" id="Ain_Dubai"><span class="fn org">Ain Dubai</span>, <a class="url external autonumber" href="https://www.aindubai.info" rel="nofollow">[x]</a>. <span class="description">Dubai is introducing the world`s tallest Ferris wheel on Bluewaters island.</span> </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Al Safa Park</b>. It is one of the oldest in Dubai. It's a favorite for sports enthusiasts, and many visitors enjoy playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer. Children love playing games in the video arcade or riding the Ferris wheel and bumper cars. The park even has a maze to wander through. Barbeques and picnic areas are available for those who want to make a day of it.</li>
<li><b>Beaches and sea</b>. There are endless water-sport opportunities as Dubai has some of the whitest and sandiest beaches in the world. Ocean temperatures range from 22&#176;C in winter up to 35&#176;C in summer, there are few wave breaks and the strong winds can make swimming difficult.  The water is also very salty so many prefer to use their hotel swimming pool.  Diving activities have been severely affected by offshore construction work for the Palms and The World; consequently, long boat trips are necessary to reach wreck sites.  Alternatively, one can make the 90-minute road journey to the East coast Emirate of <a href="/en/Fujairah" title="Fujairah">Fujairah</a> or the Sharjah enclave, Khor Fakkan, for top-class diving on coral reefs supporting extensive marine life.</li>
<li><b>Culture and Arts</b><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://jameelartscentre.org/whats-on/">[12]</a>. There are multiple cultural happenings that are still undiscovered in Dubai. Jameel Arts Centre is the first contemporary art space in Dubai. Public programs include exhibitions, artist talks, tours, film screenings, workshops, and live performances for all ages.</li>
<li><b>Deep Sea Fishing</b> is also hosted by professional skippers whose services are offered by the boats and charters one hires. These professional skippers guide and help in capturing the desired target in an easy and safe manner.  The boats are well equipped with life jackets, flares, first aid facilities, and all precautionary measures for the utmost protection of the travelers. Professional fishermen and captains of the boat are assigned to the people to ensure complete safety. Staff is fully trained, ethically aware of the needs of the travelers, and available to keep sharp eye on weather conditions and atmosphere for safety measures. Dubai is actually a place for water freaks and people who like to explore nature from the lap of the sea. Bottom fishing and trolling are both options that can be availed for preying on the fish. Bottom fishing is about attracting a variety of fish by using bait like squids by stopping the boat in the middle of the sea. Trolling is done to catch big fish by using trolling lures or plastic fish as bait.</li>
<li><b>Desert Motorcycle Tours </b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bigreddxb.com">[13]</a>.

<li><b>Desert Safari</b> or <b>Dune Bashing</b>. Dubai is well known for its desert safari and extreme adventure sports in the desert. The most popular extreme adventure tour is called the dune bashing. Dune Bashing uses different things like 4X4 Safari Jeeps, Sand Boards, Quad Bikes, and Dune Buggies. Head out to the desert in an SUV with specialist Desert Drivers. The drivers will take you for a roller-coaster ride over sand dunes, show you the sunset from a strategic vantage point and then take you to a lavish dinner with music and dance to complete the atmosphere.  You may want to stay clear of the dune-bashing if you know that you get carsick easily. They have recently added a Hummer H3 to the roster, which costs a bit more but is worth the money like featured by MTDubai, Clifton Tours and  Happy Adventures.

<p>While Dubai tries to promote itself as the business and entertainment capital of the world, the government has a complex and at times frustrating work permit procedure that one should not attempt on their own unless they have prior experience. Therefore, it is best to go through official channels when looking for work in Dubai as spot inspections are frequent and if found working illegally, both the employee and the employer will be subject to fines and even deportation.
</p><p>All the necessary forms and documents are written and processed in Arabic and are best left to a professional or a "P.R.O" to handle your paperwork.
</p><p>There are rules about changing jobs and their frequency. These rules are equally applicable to all nationalities. They have to complete their contract period, which is 2 years. If the employee breaks his/her contract before the completion of 2 years, the new employer has to offer them a salary above 5000 AED in-order to avoid a ban. Otherwise, the employee has to wait until the completion of the leftover months of his canceled contract. If the employer breaks the contracts, then the employee can join another employer immediately irrespective of nationality, religion, caste,e or creed.
</p><p>With the price of rentals ever soaring in Dubai and neighboring Emirates, it is a good idea to discuss a housing allowance when negotiating a pay package.
</p><p>Despite all this, there are a few upsides, Dubai companies are generous with holidays averaging almost 39 days a year of paid vacation (including public holidays), a round trip ticket home once a year (depending on your contract), and most importantly all your earnings are 100% tax-free. This includes Western <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.teachaway.com">teachers</a> working for one of many English-language academies.
</p><p>Recruitment fraud is quite pervasive in this part of the world. Read your employment contract carefully before signing and do not pay any fees to recruitment agencies, as they are usually paid by the companies. Your passport is your personal property and cannot be withheld by the employer unless you are in a position of trust or are handling large sums of money.
</p><p>Dubai has been accused by numerous organizations of effectively enslaving workers from Southeast Asia by allowing companies to take their passports without returning them and allowing salaries to go unpaid. Foreign workers, Western and otherwise, have no rights that will be upheld by the courts, and so they have no recourse should they feel their rights violated. Potential workers should be aware of this when considering work in Dubai.

<p>Dubai is practically synonymous with shopping. The huge amounts of cargo passing through its port and the low tariffs ensure that practically anything is available at fairly competitive rates, although the appreciation of the Dirham and the plentiful supply of shoppers means that Dubai is no longer a bargain basement shopping city. You'll also find products in western chain stores, still with the original tags quoting euro or sterling prices, being sold with a 20-30% markup once converted to Dirhams.
</p><p>The best things to buy in Dubai are textiles, electronics, and gold, electronics is believed to be much cheaper while textiles and gold offer a wide range of selection.
</p><p>Even in the mega-malls, Dubai shops have no storeroom and no stocks in reserve - and for clothes shopping this may mean that you may struggle to find the style you want in the size you want.  Shops open as early as 9AM and stay open to 10PM and on weekends to 12AM and some stay to 1AM.
</p><p>Remember to haggle in the souks, as discounts are almost always available and even in situations where the item will not become much cheaper, the customer is always expected to "play the game" of haggling. A simple question of "what's your best price?" will often result in a shopkeeper going to extraordinary lengths to sell his stock. 
</p><p>Prices in the malls and other Western shops tend not to be negotiable. Far from being a bad thing, this allows the canny visitor to work out comparative prices for common souvenirs - an invaluable aid when a shop-keeper in a souk is asking for a higher price.

<ul><li><b>Dubai Shopping Festival</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="https://www.dubaifestivalcitymall.com/">[25]</a> has been the biggest shopping event in the middle east since 1996. Almost every shop has a sale, starting in January and ending February. Dubai Shopping Festival is not just about shopping. The festival is itself a complete family entertainer and holds grand events having live concerts and performances performed by international celebrities.

<ul><li><b>Satwa</b> &#8212; this is a small community much resembling a town, its streets are rowed by textile shops notably opposite the Satwa Mosque ending to the opposite of Satwa clinic. Most of the people flock to Satwa for their textiles, you might sometimes catch offers and discounts but if you don't do so try bargaining the price, this is what most locals do, even if you're a tourist convince the salesman to give you a discount, bargain till you get the lowest price available. Not only is Satwa a hub for textile shops; some tailoring shops on the corners are also found if you want a dress made as soon as possible after purchasing the raw materials. Raw silk might also be available in some shops. Because of the row of textile shops, it might be Dubai's version of Little India and Little Manila as many Indians reside in this district as well as Filipinos.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Gold Souk</b>&#8212; Not a mall, but a <b>historic market</b> that has been a part of Dubai since its origin of Dubai itself. Located at the mouth of the creek, it dazzles people by selling gold in large quantities and with little visible security. A must-visit for shoppers and sightseers.  Most of the gold is 22ct quality and quite expensive - although even here the shopkeepers are prepared to bargain - and the craftsmanship can be remarkably detailed.  The gold items are sold by weight with a "making charge" added on top to cover the workmanship.  It pays, therefore, to go shopping armed with the current gold price and a knowledge of the making charges in order to hone the bargaining process.  Many outlets are part of chains that also have branches in malls, so are generally reliable.</li>
<li><b>Spice Souk</b>&#8212; As above, not a mall, but a <b>historic market</b> that has been a part of Dubai since its origin of Dubai itself. Located at the mouth of the creek, it is not far from the Gold Souk but has sadly declined a bit in recent years as supermarkets take over the spice trade.  If you're actually shopping for spices, odds are you'll get better prices and quality with much less hassle at Carrefour.  Both the Spice Souk and the Gold Souq are a rather hot and sweaty experience with limited air-conditioning, so wear appropriately cool, loose clothing if visiting in mid-summer. Individual shops are air-conditioned.  Although regularly visited by tourists,  none of the souks are considered a tourist area and as such modest dress should be worn to avoid causing offense or attracting unwanted attention.</li></ul>

<p><b>Shawarma</b> is the most available food item on almost all streets (and cheap!) in Dubai. It is the Arabic equivalent of the Burger. It is meat that has been cooked on a skewer and then cut into thin strips and placed into a kuhbus (<i>pita</i>) bread with vegetables and dressing. It costs about AED 6 ($1.9) for either the plain-jane variety or the more exotic Lebanese and Iranian varieties but can be found in Iranian-owned restaurants for as low as 2 AED. The Shawarma sold by Indian, Iraqi, and Iranian restaurants is arguably the cheapest.
</p><p>Another local snack is <b>Fala-Fil</b> (Felafel, Falafel) also available at about the same cost as the shawarma also starting at 2 AED.
</p><p>Most the American fast food chains have set up shops in Dubai, including KFC, Chilli's, TGI Fridays, Starbucks, and Mcdonald's. The beauty of the food in Dubai is that you will probably find cuisine for every taste.
</p><p>For Indians (and vegetarians) Dubai has a big selection of budget Indian vegetarian food. Dosa, vada, idlee, samosa, chapaati/roti, with generous servings of sabji (cooked vegetable stew) are available at throwaway prices, typically less than 10Dhs ($2.5) per course. The more expensive stuff costs up to USD 5.00. Bur Dubai (particularly Meena Bazaar area) and Karama are the places that abound in these restaurants. Most of them are open from 7AM till 10PM or 11PM throughout the week and some may run 24/7/365.

<p>As Dubai has grown from a small town into a bustling city, so has the nightlife scene. Most 3 to 5 star hotels have bars and nightclubs for those interested in the nightlife. World-class DJs frequent Dubai's nightclubs, and many A-list musical celebrities are adding Dubai to their list of tour dates.
</p><p>However, Dubai has several laws regarding alcohol which tourists should be aware of before visiting:
</p>
<ul><li>Alcohol is available only at licensed premises, usually attached to hotels (most nightclubs and bars are in or attached to hotels, though they may have separate entrances).<div style="width:95%; float:center; border: none; margin: 0.5em 0 0 1em; padding: 0.4em;"></div></li></ul>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1" border="0">

<tbody><tr>
<td align="left" width="100%" style="background-color:#f3fff3; border:1px solid; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em">
<p>Check if your hotel or hostel allows alcohol before entering with it. Some housing is Muslim-owned and it may be banned from their premises.
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><br />	
</p>
<ul><li>Alcohol is not sold on religious holidays, nor during daylight hours in Ramadan (even to non-Muslims).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>It is illegal to drink alcohol in public places</b>, and there is a zero-tolerance policy on drunk driving.  Anyone involved in a collision found with alcohol in their blood will usually get a month's jail sentence and a fine.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Alcohol can be bought only for home consumption at certain outlets in Dubai, and an alcohol license is required.  Supermarkets only stock non-alcoholic beers.  Even food items containing alcohol are not sold in supermarkets.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Remember to carry some sort of identification when visiting a bar if you are young, as you will not be let in otherwise. The law prohibits anyone below 21 to enter.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Authorities take disruptive behavior while intoxicated very seriously, which as you can imagine will lead to jail time or deportation.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Ch ali mango and apple Hilal Drinks are also widely sold.</li></ul>

<p>Earlier the demand for hotel rooms badly outstripped supply, resulting in some of the most expensive rooms in the world: it was difficult to find anything decent for under Dhs 600 (US$200), especially during the September-May high season. However, now, as of July 2009, there are several five-star hotels offering rooms for less than $140 (€100) for the off-season and plenty of other cost-effective options. The longer the stay, the better the deal cost-wise. As mentioned rent with utilities can be as low as 300 AED a month.

<p>Dubai is governed by a strict interpretation of Islamic law which must be respected by all travelers. Don't publicly criticize or distribute material against Islam. Eating in public during the holy month of Ramadan is prohibited from sunrise until sunset and visitors should consume meals in the confines of their hotel or residence; some restaurants stay open with a curtain over their door during this time. Many shopping malls offer this service. 
</p><p>
In conversations about politics and world affairs, do not criticize the ruling family of any of the seven Emirates or prominent business families.  </p><div style="display: table; border-radius: 6px; background-color: #fff3f3; border: 1px solid #a00; margin: 0.5em 1em 0 1em; padding: 6px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #aaa;" class="pp_warningbox">

<p>While petty crime is hardly reported or mentioned in the news, keep an eye on your wallet or purse when in crowded areas like Naser Square or Deira in general. If withdrawing large amounts of cash from ATMs or banking institutions, either conceal the notes or ask the institution's security to escort you to your vehicle. Cases have occurred where people have been robbed of large amounts of cash when in crowded places just because they were not careful.
</p><p>Conmen are ever present in Dubai, especially scammers. Do not arrange meetings or entertain their requests or give any personal details. Should they not comply, individuals who will be happy to listen to their business propositions are the police.
</p><p>Thanks to Dubai's new property boom, real estate fraudsters are also popping up, so exercise caution if you are there to shop around for a new home. 
</p><p>Public display of affection are frowned upon and public sexual acts can lead to jail time followed by deportation or even possibly death. That includes married couples. A British couple was arrested and faced jail sentences because they had sexual contact on a beach in Dubai. If all tourists remain respectful and decent at all times and ensure that they do not upset the local people in any way whatsoever, there should hopefully be no problems.
</p><p>The United Arab Emirates might seem to have more relaxed laws than their other Arab counterparts, but the laws are still very different from most Western countries, and their laws are strictly enforced. A simple kiss in a public place, having an alcoholic drink in the wrong place or even losing your temper could land you a month or more in jail. 
</p><p>The city of Dubai has spent millions of dollars on sophisticated technology along with other emirates in the UAE to crack down on criminal activities and deter crime, including the use of fixed, mobile CCTV and facial recognition, and license plate detection systems. Be aware that there are cameras and visible police presence in major areas.

<p>Adultery is punished up to death.
</p><p>Women should dress sensibly and avoid wearing revealing outfits when in busy areas. This is especially true when traveling to districts like Karama, Deira, and Bur-Dubai, where the streets are packed with men, especially on evenings and weekends. While swimsuits and bikinis are a common sight on Dubai beaches, avoid sunbathing topless or wearing micro bikinis - even on the private beach of a hotel. Rape and sexual violence are taken seriously by authorities, If you ever fell victim of sexual violence do not hesitate to contact the police as well as notify the embassy.
</p><p>Drug use and distribution are serious criminal offenses, even when in the company of the person consuming the material, and can lead to a prison sentence or the death penalty. Passenger baggage is screened quite thoroughly when entering Dubai. Even prescription drugs (without original prescription notes) or ones that you bought over the counter in your country can lead to a prison sentence.
</p><p>Driving and pedestrian safety has also been an issue given the different nationalities that share the road. Do not jaywalk or cross where there are no clear pedestrian markings. Speeding is common here, and the odds of you being knocked over are quite high unless you follow the rules. Avoid driving on the extreme left lane of highways to avoid being "flashed" and being forced to move a lane over. Road rage is also starting to become an issue given the increase in traffic jams and poor driving courtesy.
</p><p>Rude hand gestures (the "finger", etc.) and profanity can lead to fines and jail times if reported, so keep your cool if you are cut off or are behind an erratic driver. In general, you will find those gestures and actions that some may find only slightly offensive in your home country--or perhaps not offensive at all--can at times be extremely offensive to the Dubai locals. Therefore, use a degree of common sense of what is right and wrong to help you stay out of trouble.

<p>Please be aware of the travel scammers in Dubai. Normally their "representatives" are found in or around shopping malls, sitting in fancy stalls where they will tell if you answer their question, you will win a gift, and they will even help you answer the question by giving you clear hints.
</p><p>Next, they will congratulate you on answering the question and winning a "surprise" gift. They will have your contact details written on a piece of paper and will invite you to join their "party" the next day, where you would receive your "free" gift. There are also their reps in the shopping malls who will collect from you your contact details and will say they will contact you if you win in the "lucky draw" that night. 
</p><p>And then you will start receiving calls from their company the next day seeking your confirmation to attend.
</p><p>If you go to their well-decorated office the next day, one of their reps will have a meeting with you for at least one and a half hours, doing nothing but wasting your time and forcing you to buy one of their travel packages (staying for 36 nights or so in five-star hotels around the world during coming five years on "discounted" rates, etc.). You will find it a bit difficult to get rid of them once you join them. Never ever give them any money or your financial details: simply avoid their reps in the shopping malls etc.

<p>The international code for UAE is +971, for Dubai, add a 4 afterward for land lines.
</p><p>Local mobile phone numbers will start +971 50 xxx yyyy or +971 56 xxx yyyy (newly introduced as of second half of 2008) for the GSM provider etisalat <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.etisalat.ae">[43]</a> and +971 55 xxx yyyy and +971 52 xxx yyyy for the GSM provider du <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.du.ae">[44]</a>.
</p><p><b>GSM</b>&#8212; Those with GSM phones can expect auto roaming from their home countries. As roaming fees are quite high (easily 3 USD per minute and often more for a call to Europe) and incoming calls are also charged, consider buying a local prepaid GSM SIM card, designed especially for tourists, from one of the two cellular providers of the U.A.E.:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Du</b> - product Visitor Mobile Line - 70 Dirhams - available at the <i>Telefonika</i> kiosk in the arrival hall of Dubai Airport.</li>
<li><b>Etisalat</b> - product Ahlan - 90 Dirhams - available at the Duty-Free Shop (arrival hall) of Dubai Airport</li></ul>
<p>Using these products, calls to Europe will be charged at a maximum of about 0.55 USD per minute. Incoming calls are free of charge.
</p><p><b>Phone Booths</b>&#8212; Phone booths are located on most streets. Phone cards can be purchased from hotels and tourist shops. 
</p><p><b>Internet</b> &#8212; Internet cafés are rather hard to find. The usual rate per hour is 3-4 AED. There are a number of cafés on Al Musalla Rd./Al Mankhool Rd. in <i>Bur Dubai</i>, including one at 38 Al Musalla Rd. and one at Computer Plaza next to the Ramada Hotel. A number of Internet cafes are found in <i>Satwa</i> too. In Satwa, there is the French Connection in the Al Wafa Tower on Sheikh Zayed road (opposite side of the road from the Dusit Hotel), which has Wi-Fi access and nice cakes/pastries. In <i>Al Qusais</i>, there is an internet café a five-minute walk northwest of the Dubai Youth Hostel. Turn right out of the gates and walk to LuLu's Hypermarket. The café is located inside the food court and currently charges AED 4.00 per hour.  Note that the Skype website has recently been unblocked by the two major service providers, Du and Etisalat — they are the only service providers and are owned by the government. You may wish to consider using a proxy or VPN to bypass the blocked websites in the UAE, but this is considered illegal in the eyes of local officials and can lead to penalties or jail time.
</p><p>Surprisingly, the malls do not have internet cafés, but most have Wi-Fi, mostly free. Most hotel business centers are equipped with internet cafés, but these are expensive.
</p><p>Dubai International Airport (DXB) has free Wi-Fi in the terminal. Bring your device with you as some hotels offer free Wi-Fi.

<p>Be careful in some streets as you might meet people who may want to sell pirated movies or other items that can be replicated or faked to you at 10-15 dirhams. You shouldn't buy them as pirated items are illegal. Those involved in this would usually lead their victims off the streets into an alley or into a building, to elude the eye of the police officers. Whatever it is, as a general rule of thumb, you should never go into a covert place with someone you don't know while you're touring. This is very dangerous as anything could happen.
