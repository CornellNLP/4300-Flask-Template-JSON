<p>Kolkata's history is intimately related to the British East India Company, which first arrived in 1690, and to British India, of which Calcutta became the capital of in 1772. Job Charnock was widely known as the founder of Calcutta (Sutanuti, Govindapur &amp; Calcutta) but in recent years a number of Indian historians have disputed this claim, arguing that Calcutta occupies the site of an older Indian city, centered around the ancient Kali temple at Kalighat. This claim has been accepted by the Kolkata High Court. The Court has dismissed the name of Job Charnock as the founder of the city and 24 th August as its date of birth. The historic Judgement was based upon an high level Expert Commitee findings. It has been proved that Kolkata had an highly civilized society for centuries before the Europeans first came here. 
</p><p>Whatever its origins, Calcutta flowered as the capital of British India during the nineteenth century, the heyday of the Raj. Calcutta University, the first modern Indian university was founded here in 1857. Calcutta became the center of Indian arts and literature, and the national movement for independence got its start here. However, with the transfer of the capital to Delhi in 1911, the pains of the partition of Bengal in 1947, and a violent and bloody Maoist movement (the Naxalite movement) in the 1970s, Calcutta has become synonymous with urban decay and poverty ("New York is deteriorating into New Calcutta," opined an editorial in The New York Times on Dec. 25th, 1988).

<p>Kolkata is the main business, commercial and financial hub of eastern India. Kolkata witnessed an economic decline from the late sixties till the late nineties. The city's economic fortunes turned the tide as the economic liberalization in India during the early nineties reached Kolkata during late nineties. Kolkata is a multicultural, cosmopolitan city. Apart from the diversity of India, the cultures represented are that of the Europeans (Including Germans, Armenians, and others), and other Asians (Including Chinese, Sinhalese, and Tibetans).
</p><p>Since 1977, a "Left Front" coalition of communist and Marxist parties has continuously ruled the state. This is reflected in street names and memorials in the city. For example there are streets like Lenin Sarani, Ho Chi Minh Sarani, etc.. The Left Front regained control of the Municipal Corporation of Kolkata from the Trinamul Congress in the 2005 civic elections.

<p>Kolkata is the economic hub of eastern India and with a vast hinterland it bustles with  economic activities. Kolkata creates a huge number of employments and supports many migrants from neighboring states and other parts of the country. The landscape of the city is also fast changing with flyovers, gardens and several new commercial establishments. Kolkata city itself has expanded into its suburbs, with the Greater Kolkata stretching from Kalyani (in Nadia District) in North to Diamond Harbour in South (in the South 24 Parganas District).
</p><p>The city's fortunes have looked up since the early nineties, coinciding with the liberalization of the Indian economy. Its economy has been amongst the fastest growing in the country. The New Metro city is characterised by popular spots like Inox Multiplexes, Nandan, Tantra, Barista Coffee Shops, Sourav's Pavilion and Science City. While manufacturing still remains the mainstay of the economy, service sector is fast becoming one of the major contributors to Kolkata's economy. Tourism is one other important revenue earner for Kolkata in particular, and Bengal in general.
</p><p>Kolkata is home to many industrial units, of large Indian corporations, whose product range is varied and includes - engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches and wagons.
</p><p>Several industrial estates like Taratolla, Kalyani, Uluberia, Dankuni, Kasba, Howrah are spread throughout the urban agglomeration. A huge leather complex has come up at Bantolla. An export processing zone has been set up in Falta. Specialized setups like the country's first Toy Park, and a Gem and Jewellery Park have also been established.
</p><p>Kolkata is also starting to become a major hub for the IT (Information Technology) industry. With the formation of New Town at Rajarhat and extension of Salt Lake's Sector-V, Kolkata is rapidly turning into a pro-IT town. More and more businesses are coming to Kolkata to set up their offices.

<p>Kolkata is in the eastern part of India at 22°82′ N 88°20′ E. It has spread linearly along the banks of the river Hooghly.
</p><p>The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has an area of 185 square kilometres. The city proper today can be roughly divided into two sections along Mother Teresa Sarani (Park Street). North of Park Street is the more congested part of the city. South of Park Street is the slightly better planned section of the city.
</p><p>The old Central Business District (CBD) is where the seat of the West Bengal Government is located, along with many other government offices. Several banks have their corporate (Allahabad Bank, United Bank of India, UCO Bank) or regional headquarters (Reserve Bank of India, State Bank of India, Bank of India, Central Bank of India amongst many others) around the B. B. D. Bagh area. Many of Kolkata's older business groups have their main offices here. The area is a mix of multi-storeyed office blocks and colonial buildings.
</p><p>The newer CBD is around the south of Park Street, Camac Street and AJC Bose Road. Several high-rise office blocks including some of Kolkata's tallest commercial buildings - like the Chatterjee International Centre, Tata Centre, Everest House, Industry House, CGO Building - are located here. An even-newer CBD is now being set up in the Rajarhat (Newtown) area, lying between Salt Lake and the Airport.
</p><p>Maidan (open field) is situated between the river Ganges and J.L.Nehru Road (or Chowringhee). It is said to be the lungs of Kolkata. The lush green meadow also houses Victoria Memorial, Eden Gardens, and several sporting clubs. Kolkatans simply love to stroll in the Maidan.
</p><p>In an effort to relieve congestion in the main city, many government offices have shifted to high-rise office buildings lining Bidhan Nagar's (Salt Lake) Central Park.
</p><p>The residential buildings are mainly lowrise and comprise of older colonial buildings and numerous new four storied apartment blocks. Ten to twelve storied apartment blocks have come up in large numbers in south Kolkata. The city has relaxed its rules on high-rise construction recently and twenty storied buildings are becoming more common. The tallest residential towers of eastern India - the four thirty-five-storey towers of South City are under construction on Prince Anwar Shah Road.
</p><p>Heavy construction activity along the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass is changing the face of the city. Luxury hotels, a convention centre, speciality hospitals, condominium complexes, malls and multiplexes are coming up at a rapid pace.
</p><p>The city's expansion in the eastern side is spearheaded by the construction of a large new city called New Town adjacent to the well planned Bidhan Nagar. Located in Rajarhat, it is one of the largest planned urban developments in India.
</p><p>The neglected western side of the urban agglomeration has got a boost recently with the signing of an agreement with Chiputra, an Indonesian company to build the Kolkata West International City (KWIC). Another huge new township is in the proposal state in Dankuni.
</p><p>Slums and dilapidated structures exist in many pockets of the city proper and house over 25% of the city's population (Census 2001). Slum redevelopment schemes have helped improve living conditions by a small extent but there is huge scope for improvement in this area. Efforts to shift slum dwellers to newer developments have often met with resistance and failure because many of the slums are in prime areas of the city and the slum dwellers who are integrated in the social structure of the neighbourhood do not want to shift.
</p><p>Opposition to the setting up of the Nano factory at Shingur, 50 Kms. away from Kolkata, where the Tata's plan to build the cheapest car in the world, threatens to take away a lot of the investments due to come to the state.

<p><b>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.airportsindia.org.in/kolkata/index.jsp">[1]</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>CCU</b>) connects Kolkata with <a href="/en/South_East_Asia" class="mw-redirect" title="South East Asia">South East Asia</a> and receives some flights from <a href="/en/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Most of the traffic towards Western hemisphere is handled by Emirates(Twice Daily) and Qatar Airways. New operators are coming soon. The domestic terminal, on the other hand, is among the best in India. It has undergone a major face-lift and expansion including a swanky new terminal,night landing facilities,etc to cope with the expanding bulk of air traffic and new airline companies popping up almost every month.
</p><p>Take a prepaid taxi from the airport to the city. It is about 20 km from the city. As of April 30, 2017, it cost Rs. 315 (approx. USD 5) for a non-AC taxi from the airport to Chowringhee (heart of city center). There is also a government prepaid booth outside the airport. This booth quoted Rs. 780 (approx. USD 12) for an AC taxi to the same location in Chowringhee. As far as one could make out, the AC taxi was a better car but not by much. Also note that even if you exit the airport, you can go back in to book a prepaid taxi from the government booth inside the terminal. The government agents are known for many years to short change all pre-paid taxi customers as all fares are Not rounded - look at the bill and pay exact fare. They have a lot of spare change to give, that they keep hidden. With 3,800 prepaid rides daily this adds to lot of black money each year.
</p><p>The rail link connecting the airport to the Circular Rail station in Dum Dum is closed at present.
</p><p>Buses from Airport AC Bus Stand are operated by WBTC (West Bengal Transport Corporation)
The bus stand is located beside Terminal 2 Domestic Gates.After leaving the stand,the bus covers all the gates and then come out of the terminal.#Note all buses are air-conditioned.

Directly facing Howrah are ferries (Rs. 4) that can get you to the other side of the river either Babu Ghat or Fairlie Place from where you can arrange onward transportation with anything from taxis to public buses to human rickshaws.  With the traffic situation this might actually save you time as well as money. 
</p><p>The <b>Foreign Ticket Office</b> is on Fairlie Place (with the main GPO on your left, take the next left - the office is a few minutes walk on the left) - very helpful and efficient service.
</p><p>Kolkata is well connected by rail to almost all the big stations in India and also serves as the gateway to the North Eastern India. If you are coming to Kolkata by trains using Sealdah station, you may prefer taking a pre-paid taxi to enter the city. The pre-paid taxi stand is just outside the station's main entrance. The counter is under a tin shade. Pre-paid taxis are reliable and will save you money and also the bargaining hassle. However beware of touts who would claim themselves to be running pre-paid taxis. Always collect the receipt from the counter first. The receipt has two parts - one part is for your reference and the other part you will need to handover to the taxi driver only after you reach your desired destination. The Taxi driver will get his payment by submitting or producing this other part to the Pre-paid Taxi counter.

<p><b>To/from Bangladesh</b> There are numerous bus options between Kolkata and <a href="/en/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. The most common way is the regular comfortable a/c buses from <a href="/en/Dhaka" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> to <a class="mw-selflink selflink">Kolkata</a> via the <a href="/en/Haridaspur" class="mw-redirect" title="Haridaspur">Haridaspur</a> / <a href="/en/Benapole" title="Benapole">Benapole</a>  border post. Private bus companies <b>Shohagh</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.shohagh.com/group/">[6]</a>,  <b>Green Line</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.greenlineparibahan.com/">[7]</a>,<b>Shyamoli</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://shyamoli.paribahan.com/">[8]</a> and others operate daily bus services on this route. Govt. buses run under the label of the state owned West Bengal Surface Transport Service Corporation (WBSTSC) and the <b>Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.brtc.gov.bd/">[9]</a> (BRTC). WBSTSC and BRTC both operate buses from Kolkata every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 5:30AM and 8:30AM, and 12:30PM while from Dhaka they leave on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 7:00AM and 7:30AM. The normal journey time is around 12 hours with a one-way fare of Rs550 or BDT600-800, roughly $8-12. If you're only headed to <a href="/en/Haridaspur" class="mw-redirect" title="Haridaspur">Haridaspur</a> the fare is Rs86 (2.5 hours). The <b>Shyamoli Paribahan</b> ticket office is at 6/1 Marquis St (<i>parallel to and one block south of Sudder Street, and just west of Mirza Ghalib St, next door to DHL</i>), 2252 0693. Beware that several travel agencies around this area also sell tickets for these buses, but at very inflated prices. At the border it's best to change money on the Indian side, but count it carefully and double-check the math on their calculator. On the Bangladesh side you can catch a flat-bed cycle-rickshaw for Tk5 for the 2km trip to the bus stand for onward travel - or you can walk, but expect the hopeful rickshaw-wallahs to follow you at least half way.
</p><p><b>To/from Eastern India via Bangladesh</b> Bus travel to some points in Eastern India are faster via Bangladesh (please note that visas may be required for entry into Bangladesh as well as for re-entry into India). If you're heading to points in Eastern India (Tripura for example) beyond Bangladesh -- then there is a regular bus service between <a href="/en/Dhaka" title="Dhaka">Dhaka</a> and <a href="/en/Agartala" title="Agartala">Agartala</a>, capital of India's <a href="/en/Tripura" title="Tripura">Tripura</a> state. Two BRTC buses leave daily from Dhaka and connect with the Tripura Road Transport Corporation vehicles, running six days a week with a roundtrip fare of BDT600 ($10).

<p>The river Hooghly that runs through the west of the city offered one of the first reasons to the foundation of the British commercial settlement. The river continues to offer one of the less crowded but slow traffic medium. There are several points (popularly called Ghats and jetties) on the bank of the river from where you can board several regular routes of ferry services. Ferries can be fairly large launches to small improvised motorized boats. They are extremely safe though. Even if you don't get any exotic manual boats like you get in Varanasi, the river transport of the city lets you go to several old spots near the bank in a hassle-free manner with an additional dash of the view of decadent river front of the city.
</p><p>Ferry(Launch) services are popular to avoid the traffic snarls along the Strand Road if you are travelling without luggage. Ahiritola/Sovabajar to Howrah Ferry offers spectacular view of the iconic Howrah Bridge as it passes beneath it.Use Dakshineswar to Belur Math Ferry and vice versa for view of Vivekananda Setu/Nibedita Setu. Numerous country boats are available for joy ride on Princep Ghat, Armenian Ghat. Life Jacket is a thing unheard here, so don’t ride the ferry if you feel unsafe. Accidents are rare but beware of the gap between jetty and the boat in case of a hurry.Fares are dirt cheap just Rs 5 or so.
</p><p>Vivada offers curated cruises aimed for tourists with various package options/destinations.

<p>Kolkata just wouldn't look the same without the plethora of yellow ambassador taxis <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://flickr.com/photos/_fulcrum/269933576/">[10]</a> that ply on its roads. They're easily available and relatively cheap, and will usually use their meters, especially outside tourist locations. Fare is Rs25 for first two km, and Rs12/km afterwards as of 2014.  Some meters are, however, outdated. As of 2015, most taxi drivers refuse using the meter when serving tourists. Be prepare to bargain. A taxi from Sudder street to Howrah should not be more then Rs150. 
</p><p>On the old meters the fare is 2 times the reading if the meter is inside, and 4 times the reading if the meter is outside. However, it is almost impossible now to find any meters outside. All Taxi meters are digital ones which are placed inside the cab. There is a "green taxi" which is red coloured (!) and charges the same. In case you are confused always ask to see the chart that the driver is supposed to carry with him. Expect to pay a bit more if you are going to the outskirts of the city or traveling at night. How much more that depends on your bargaining skills, but it should be at most Rs. 10-20 on top of the taxi meter. Unlike other metro cities in India, there is no 50%-100% surcharge for late night hires (10PM-11PM onwards).
</p><p>As of October 2016, All Yellow/White(A Blue Stripe) taxis contain new meter and pay what is displayed on the meter. Using a taxi in Kolkata can be quirky and irritant due to blatant refusals, haggling for more money, unforeseen tricks to draw more money out of the passengers pocket. Even weathered Kolkatans are often find it difficult to tame a yellow taxi. Forget seat belts, cozy seats, air conditioning in the yellow cabs. Beware of the doors which may throw open on the run and breakdown. Keep changes ready and be ready to face refusals. Police sometimes assist but mostly you are at the mercy of the driver's mood and rash/reckless driving habits. New cabs (no refusal) are painted blue and white and have air conditioning for an optional extra 25% charge.
</p><p>Since 2013, app based taxi service like OLA, Uber, Meru Cabs, OTL, Mega Cabs etc have been popping up. Download their app from the appstore and roam around hassle free but off course at rates higher(often rip off in peak hours due to surge pricing) than yellow ones. They offer safe, secure, AC , shortest path service, though availability of them during peak hours/rain-thunderstorms are difficult. OLA, Uber offers also shared service where you can save some money and share the cab with other people. Locating the cab and the passenger by each other sometimes gets difficult due to road conditions.
</p><p>One can also negotiate a passing by vehicle which is empty on point to point basis. This is a hitch hike kind of service and the fare depends on mutual verbal agreement between driver and the commuter. Generally, you can travel anywhere in the city from INR 10 to INR 40 but don't expect AC even in peak summer.

<p><b>Metro Railway, Kolkata</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kolmetro.com">[11]</a> was the first underground rail in India also to become first underwater rapid transit system in india which will connect howrah &amp; kolkata under a tunnel in Ganges(River), yet it still has only a single route connecting the north and south of the city, from Dumdum to Garia. It is the cleanest, most reliable, least crowded and most efficient of all the transportation Kolkata has to offer. Trains run every 10 minutes or 5 minutes (normal operation or rush hour respectively) and at Rs 5-20 it's very economical. A new route from East- West Kolkata is under construction.
</p><p>A new fleet of air-conditioned rakes has been inducted. They charge the same fare and are very comfortable to ride in the sizzling heat.

<p><b>Calcutta Tramways</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.calcuttatramways.com">[12]</a> is the only tram service in all of India, and the oldest surviving electric tram network of Asia. Though decommissioned in some part of the city, electric trams are still one of the means of traveling between places within the city. They move slow on the laid tracks in traffic jammed streets, but they are environment friendly (no emission). Check their site for routes and schedules. Trams are a great way to observe the old northern and central parts of Kolkata because of their pace. Apart from this, there are Heritage Tram Tours conducted by the West Bengal Tourism Department which is a great way to understand the city's past.

<p>The city has an extensive bus network (possibly the most exhaustive in the whole of India), and this is the cheapest, though not always the most comfortable means of transport. Among the buses that ply the city streets, the deluxe buses run by CSTC (Calcutta State Transport Corporation), CTC (Calcutta Tramways Company) and WBSTC (West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation) are probably the better option. There are lot of private buses plying on the streets of Kolkata. Apart from the buses of standard length, there are mini buses also on the streets. Many buses are low floor. The minimum bus fare in non A/C standard length buses is Rs. 6 and that in a mini bus is Rs. 7.
</p><p>Best app for bus routes and timings is Chalo.
</p><p>There is a bus stop for the A/C buses in the Kolkata airport premises. A/C buses are available to select destinations namely Santragachi (route V1), Tollygunj (route V2, via Gariahat), Sealdah station, from the airport.  Apart from these buses, many private or government buses drop you off a kilometer from the airport at the Airport-Barasat road intersection. You will have to flag a car or taxi for the remaining distance. (The cycle rickshaws at this intersection can only go half way to the airport).

<p>Being in Bengal, the native language of the people of Kolkata is <a href="/en/Bengali_phrasebook" title="Bengali phrasebook">Bengali</a>. However, most educated people speak <a href="/en/Hindi_phrasebook" title="Hindi phrasebook">Hindi</a> and English as well, and many others would have a basic command of English. They also like to speak in Khettrish occasionally. A large number of the street vendors and taxi drivers are not from Bengal and are native Hindi speakers. 
</p><p>Learning and using a few Bengali words will make you more cozy with locals and it can bring you unforeseen beyond expectation assistance from most people.Don’t worry even if you cant as Kolkata is one of the most friendly and welcoming place in India and most locals will be more than happy to help if you seek help in any situation. 
</p><p>Kolkatans generally take pride in city's past, Bengali culture and the city itself despite acknowledging the problems.So be respectful towards the Bengali icons/influencers especially Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray,Sourav Ganguly,Mother Teresa etc and avoid being caught in political debates, rallies or anything that can spark harsh reaction(Kashmir Issue, Illegal Bangladeshi migration, Syndicate, communal differences etc)

<ul><li>Kolkata has been nicknamed as the <b>City of Palaces</b>. This comes from the numerous palatial mansions built all over the city. During the British colonial era from 1700-1912, when Calcutta was the capital of British India, it witnessed a spate of frenzied construction activity of buildings largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Gothic, Baroque, Roman, Oriental and Islamic schools of design. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction stresses minimalism, the layout of much of the architectural variety in Kolkata owes its origins to European styles and tastes imported by the British and, to a much lesser extent, the Portuguese and French.  The buildings were designed, and inspired by the tastes of the English gentleman around and the aspiring Bengali Babu (literally a nouveau riche Bengali who aspired to cultivation of English etiquette, manners and custom as such practices were favourable to monetary gains from the British).  Today many of these structures are in various stages of decay. Some of the major buildings of this period are well maintained and several buildings have been declared as heritage structures. Conservation efforts are patchy and are often affected by problems of litigation, tenant troubles, ownership disputes, old tenancy laws and a lack of funds.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Government House</b>, Kolkata, built in the early 19th century, is modelled on Kedleston Hall. The House was once the seat of the Viceroys of India; later, when the Government moved to New Delhi, it became the residence of the Governor of Bengal, a function that it fulfils to this day. While the basic features of Kedleston have been faithfully copied (the Palladian Front, the Dome etc.), Government House is a much larger, three storeyed structure. Also, the Government of India evidently did not have the funding constraints that forced the Curzons to leave their house incomplete: Government House has all four wings originally conceived for Kedleston. So today, a 'complete', brick built Kedleston, on a much grander scale, is in its acres of gardens at the heart of the Kolkata business district.</li></ul>

<p>(See district pages for restaurant listings.)
</p><p>Kolkata was famous for having the best restaurants long before Indians in other cities learned to eat out. Many of the restaurants that line the streets in the Esplanade area have been around for more than a hundred years (unfortunately, many also show their age!). <b>Flury's</b> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.flurysindia.com/">[26]</a>, on Park Street, was once considered the best English bakery in all of Asia and you can almost imagine Joe Stilwell and Lord Mountbatten arguing over who had command over the allied forces in Burma while enjoying tea, scones, and clotted cream!
</p><p>But the joy of food in Kolkata is in its Indian foods. Nizam's, in New Market, is credited with the invention of the famous Kati Kebab roll and still serves up the best of the best. Street vendors selling egg rolls/chicken rolls abound and their freshly prepared kati rolls are safe to eat and enjoy.  Mughali Paratha (a paratha stuffed with minced meat) is a Calcutta speciality and can be found in various 'cabins' off Chowringhee Road. 'Chops', a sort of deep fried ball stuffed with beet and veggies is another peculiarity that you won't find anywhere else in the world. <i>Puchkas</i>, the Calcutta version of paani-puri, is available on the streets but be wary of the water!
</p><p>Bengali sweets are famous all over India. <i>Rasagolla</i> (cheese balls dipped in a sugary syrup), <i>Pantua</i> - a fried variant of the same, <i>Rosomalai</i>- the same cheeseballs dipped in creamy sweetened milk, <i>Mishti Doi</i> (sweet yogurt), <i>Sandesh</i> (several variations available). Try some shops like K.C. Das, Jugal's, Bhim Nag, Nakur Nandy, Sen Mahasoy, Ganguram and not to forget Mithai. These are cheap and should be eaten fresh. 
</p><p>Kolkata is also the home of Indian Chinese food (now making inroads in far-off New York!). Chinese restaurants are everywhere so try the Indian variant of hot and sour soup and the famous Indian chinese dish of chilli chicken. 
</p><p>Bengali food is centered around fish. <i>Macher jhol</i>, literally fish in curry gravy, is a watery fish curry available everywhere and goes well with rice, but Bengalis everywhere swear by the <i>hilsa</i> fish (a variant of shad). Hilsa, lightly marinaded in mustard and steamed is up there with the best fish dishes in the world. 
</p><p>"Oh! Calcutta!" on the fourth Floor of Forum Courtyard Mall, Elgin Road, serves authentic Bengali food. The specialities are the boneless Hilsa Fish fillet, steamed in a bannana leaf and served with a Mustard Gravy. Many expats, yuppies and affluent Kolkattans frequent this restaurant. The food is great, though bordering on the expensive, and portions usually small. Makes for an interesting evening out, accompanied by the  incessant Bengali chatter, so characteristic of Kolkatta. 
</p><p>While it can be difficult to find a restaurant serving authentic Bengali food, today Kolkata has of as many 10 Bengali restaurants. One of the most authentic is Kewpies, situated behind Netaji Bhavan at 2 Elgin Lane. Here, food is served on terra cotta plates with banana leaves. There's also "Aaheli" at Peerless Inn, or the more reasonably priced "Suruchi" at 89 Elliot Road. There is a wide choice of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes with an emphasis on local fish. Thalis (platters) are also available. Still, being invited back to a local's place for a home-cooked meal is the best way to sample Bengali cooking! 
</p><p>6 Ballygunge Place is stituated in South Kolkata and also offers an assortment of Bengali dishes. Bhjohori Maana has 6 outlets across the city. In South Kolkata, the Hindisthan Road outlet (Gariahat) is the best. Taroparbon is situated in Hindusthan Park, and has a large menu.
</p><p>Kastur and Rahhuni are eateries, both offering Bangladeshi food and are situated off Free School Street, near Park Street. 
</p><p>Suruchi is an old eatery, which serves only lunch in simple surroundings, and is run by the destitute women of 'The All Bengal Women's Union' at Elliot Road, off Free School Street.
</p><p>For authentic Asian cuisine (Thai, Indonesian, Japanese) head to The Fifth Element in Chowringhee. It is a fresh entry to Kolkata's epicurean culture and has gained quick patronage. Also, AC water is a must.
</p><p>If on the go in Salt Lake and passing by it, do visit Local Gourmet Salt Lake. Roasts, grill, burgers and a good twist to American food using local Kolkata meat. Also in Salt Lake visit Kaafila, a restaurant serving Afghan and Mughlai cuisine. Jabbarr Afghani (opposite the petrol station) is another place to eat.
</p><p>Park Street in Kolkata is a place for wealthy people to eat. It has restaurants like Magnolia, Peter Cat , Moulin Rouge, 
Bar-B-Q and Mocambo. They serve sizzlers, steaks, and kebabs as well as authentic Chinese food in Bar-B-Q.
</p><p>Shops outside Maidan in Centeral Kolkata will give you quite a different taste of Indian chaat.
</p><p>Try cheap Chaat on the street at Park Circus, there is one stall close to the fruit and veggies stalls. Highly recommendable and cheap (prices are shown on the sign of the stall)

<p>For individual hotel listings, please see the the various district pages.
</p><p>Kolkata has long had a concentration of budget backpacker hotels in the <a href="/en/Kolkata/Esplanade#Sleep" title="Kolkata/Esplanade">Sudder Street</a> area and many of these are colonial era gems, albeit decaying ones. Budget hotels can also be found around the station in <a href="/en/Howrah" title="Howrah">Howrah</a>.  Sudder Street is more centrally located but both are well connected by public transport.
Beware that most of the hotels are closed during the night. It is NOT a good idea arriving in the middle of the night without a prior reservation. The small hotels open when the people working there wake up. They wont be too happy seeing you first thing in the morning, so dont be surprised to hear that there are no cheap rooms and that the rate is 800 Rp or more.
</p><p>There are numerous luxurious and big budget 5 star &amp; 4 star hotels around town. Such as ITC Sonar (near Science city), The Oberoi Grand (Chowringhee), Taj Bengal (Belvedere Road, Alipur), Hyatt Regency (off EM Bypass), The Kenilworth (Russel St), Hotel Hindustan International (AJC Bose Rd), The Park (Park St) JW Marriott (off EM Bypass), Holiday Inn ( Kolkata Airport), The Westin Kolkata (Rajarhat).
</p><p>British-era clubs such as Tollygunge Club, Calcutta Club (AJC Bose Rd), Saturday Club (Theatre Rd), Bengal Club (Russel St) have lavish rooms for rent. However, they only accept bookings through members. Tollygunge Club is the ideal place to chill out. Drink chilled draft beer, lie in the outdoor jacuzzi and dine in style at the Belvedere.

<p>There are scores of internet cafes that have sprung up in every nook and corner of the city. Charges vary at around ~Rs.15 to 25 per hour. A photocopy of one's ID proof should be submitted to the internet parlor for using their internet facilities.
</p><p>Cell phone coverage in the city is excellent. There are many service providers offering a wide variety of plans. Among them are BSNL <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.calcuttatelephones.com">[27]</a>, Vodafone <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.vodafone.in">[28]</a>, Reliance <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.relianceinfo.com/Infocomm/">[29]</a>, and Airtel. It might be a good idea to buy a cell phone and use one of those prepaid plans to get yourself connected while you are in the city.
</p><p>SIM cards are not available for purchase at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.  There are no kiosks available anywhere in the airport.

<p>Kolkata is reasonably safe, and in general the people are more friendly and helpful than in many of India's other large cities. One noted problem is the drug dealers around Sudder Street. However, as the dealers obviously do not want to draw undue attention to their activity, they are generally not persistent and rarely a threat.
