Mumbai was originally a conglomeration of seven islands on the <a href="/en/Konkan" title="Konkan">Konkan</a> coastline which over time were joined to form the island city of Bombay.

</p><p>Mumbai is undoubtedly the commercial capital of India and is one of the predominant port cities in the country.

<p><b>Western and Central, East and West</b><br />
</p><p>A visitor to Mumbai's suburbs will quickly learn that the suburbs are divided into "Western" and "Central". You will also hear of a "West" side and an "East" side. Here is a quick explanation for the confusion.  
</p>
<ul><li>The Western and Central suburbs are named after the local railway lines that serve the respective areas. The Western and Central Railways are rail lines that serve the western and central parts of <i>India</i>. Both have their headquarters in Mumbai. The Harbor Line is a feeder line that connects the harbor areas to the Central and Western lines. It also provides connectivity to the Northeastern suburbs of Mumbai and onwards to <a href="/en/Navi_Mumbai" title="Navi Mumbai">Navi Mumbai</a>. Most of these areas do not lie anywhere close to a harbor.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Almost all localities in Mumbai have a "West" side and an "East" side. "West" means West of the railway line and "East" means East of the railway line. For example, Mulund (West) means that the area is to the west of the Mulund railway station. In addresses, West and East are abbreviated, i.e. Mulund(W) and Mulund(E).</li></ul>

<p><br />
Mumbai is a city built on successive waves of migrations. The neighborhoods acquired their character from the communities that settled there first. These neighborhoods are too numerous to list and there is no commonly accepted way to group them into larger districts. But roughly, from the south to the north, this is how the city developed.

<p>Mumbai is a bustling, diverse metropolis with a flair all its own. The entrepreneurial spirit and pulsing pace of life provide a sharp contrast to much of the rest of India. It is also the financial capital of India and the capital of the state of Maharashtra.

<p>There has been much debate regarding the original name of the city. Some say the current name of the city Mumbai is the original name; and is an eponym derived from "Mumba", the name of the local Hindu goddess Mumbadevi, and "Aai", meaning "mother" in Marathi. Others claim Bombay was an anglicized version of Bom Bahia, a name given by the Portuguese to mean "Beautiful Bay" or "the Good Bay" and later made popular by the British as the name of the Bombay state.
</p><p>The name was officially changed from Bombay to Mumbai in 1995. In the West, Mumbai has become more commonly accepted in order to avoid controversy. It is also fondly called as Aamchi Mumbai आमची मुंबई ("our Mumbai").

<p>Though the seven islands that now make up the city have a long recorded history like any other place in India, their journey to form the city of Mumbai really started in 1498, when the Portuguese took them over from the Sultan of Gujarat. They built a settlement, forts, and churches, (including the strange looking Portuguese Church that stands to this day.) They, however, could not make much of their possession and the seven islands were handed over to England in 1661 as part of the dowry of Catherine de Braganza when she married Charles II of England. He wasn't very interested in the islands either, and he leased them to the British East India Company for £10 a year in 1668. The East India Company built the docks, the trading posts, and the fort that would form the nerve centre of the city. They also started off the long process of reclaiming land and joining the islands, an activity which went on until the 1960s. 
</p><p>The port attracted industries and the entrepreneurial communities like the Parsis, Gujaratis, and Marwaris (from Rajasthan) migrated and set up trading companies and factories in the late 19th century. Industries attracted migrant labor from different parts of the country. The successive waves of migration shaped the character of the city and its neighborhoods. 
</p><p>The city that owes its existence to the efforts of the British was also the birthplace of the Indian National Congress, which played an overwhelmingly important role in the independence movement. The city whose mills were built by industrialists from across the country is the capital of Maharashtra state, which was carved on linguistic lines for <a href="/en/Marathi_phrasebook" title="Marathi phrasebook"> Marathi</a> speakers. 
</p><p>In the 80s, high labor costs and unrest forced the closure of many textile mills and the city went into a decline from which it started recovering only in the late 90s.  The high population put a strain on the infrastructure. The rail and road network has been undergoing a steady improvement over the 90s, but because of the magnitude of the task, the roads seem to be perennially under construction. Mumbai has now reinvented itself as a hub for the Service industry.
</p><p>In January 1993, in the wake of the destruction of the Babri Mosque in <a href="/en/Ayodhya" title="Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a>, a wave of riots swept the city, with over 1000 people killed, the vast majority of whom were Muslims.  Relations between the city's various ethnic groups have been tense ever since, with several terrorist outrages (see <a href="#Stay_safe">#Stay safe</a>) adding fuel to the fire.

<p>Mumbai is the most cosmopolitan city in India. In comparison with the rest of the country, the city is quite liberal. With a regular influx of immigrants from rest of India, the citizens, popularly known as 'Mumbaikers', have shown remarkable tolerance towards other cultures, making it a true cultural melting pot. However in recent times, this tolerance has sometimes bowed under external pressures. Between the 60s and 80s, there was resentment about the non-Marathi speakers taking away jobs. The 1991 and 1993 riots between Hindus and Muslims did attempt to affect this spirit, however the city largely managed to recover from these, although serious divisions remain as memories remain scarred.

<p>Mumbai has three main seasons — Summer, Monsoon, and Winter (milder summer). The best time to visit is during the winter between November and February. Humidity is also less during the winter, when the climate is pleasant; the minimum temperature is 17 degrees centigrade and the maximum is 30-31 degrees. Summer is from March to May with highs in the low to mid 30s (roughly 80-90°F). It is hot and humid during this time. June to September is the monsoon season when the city is lashed by heavy rains. The city gets flooded two or three times and normal life gets disrupted during  this season. Climate is humid pretty much throughout the year because the city rests on the coast.

<p>Being the financial capital of India, Mumbai has excellent connectivity with most of the major cities around the world, including, New York, London, Frankfurt, Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur to name a few. If you are flying from Europe it is generally cheaper to fly from London, and there are many flights daily. Most of the domestic sectors too are linked to Mumbai, making it the second busiest aviation hub in the country.

<p>Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:IATA">IATA</a>: <b>BOM</b>) (ICAO: VABB)<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.csia.in">[4]</a> is India's second-busiest airport and one of the main international gateways to the country. Many international airlines such as British Airways, United, Emirates, Malaysia Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, and Singapore Airlines, fly into Mumbai. Low-cost carriers also fly to the city. 
</p><p>The airport consists mainly of two terminals (domestic and international) - both terminals use the same airspace but are 4km apart. There is a free shuttle bus connecting them but be prepared for long delays through security.  Going from Domestic to International you are taken outside the airport and you will re-enter through International Departures.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Terminal 1</b> Domestic (low-cost) Terminal
<ul><li><b>Terminal 1A</b>: is no longer in operation. all services of  Air India have been moved to the new T2 which serves both domestic and international sectors of Air India</li>
<li><b>Terminal 1B</b>: serves various private airlines, such as Indigo, SpiceJet, &amp; GO Air (usually low-cost airlines).</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Terminal 2</b> International Terminal Full Service Carriers like Vistara and Air India now operate from T2 (the international terminal). It is advisable to check with the airline or your ticket receipt regarding departure / arrival terminal.</li></ul>
<p>The aesthetically designed new international terminal (T2) opened in 2014 replacing the old international terminal.
</p><p>The Sahar Elevated Access Road, abbreviated to SEAR, is a dedicated, elevated, express access road in Mumbai that connects the Western Express Highway (WEH) near Hanuman Nagar junction in Vile Parle, with the forecourts of Terminal T2 of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. It facilitates easier and quicker access to the commuters proceeding to and from the airport.

<p>The airport is 28 km from downtown. Take a prepaid coupon taxi to minimize hassle.  Never pay more than Rs 450-650 for a prepaid taxi.  This amount should get you all the way to the southernmost point of Colaba, the main tourist district. While it is possible to take metered taxis to your eventual destination, it is always a safer bet to take the prepaid taxis, in order to avoid being taken to your destination via a longer route, thus increasing the meter reading! While it is not mandatory to pay extra charges for your luggage, a tip of Rs 50-100 shall always be appreciated. Be extra careful with the main prepaid counter on the left as you leave the terminal.  There is a well-known scam with the employees here replacing your 500 rupee bill with a 100 rupee bill and giving you change for the latter.  
</p><p>There are many prepaid taxi offices all in a row as you are exiting the airport, if one offers a very high rate, just walk to the next window and so forth until you find one with a good rate. Go to the taxi office and purchase a coupon to take to the driver. The coupon will have the taxi registration number written on it. Make sure that you get into that very taxi. Do not accept a lift from someone claiming to be a taxi driver as they may charge much higher prices designed to target tourists. The charges will depend on the general area you need to get to and will include all tolls to be paid. Most premium hotels will organize their own cars which is a much better alternative.
Radio meter taxis like MERU are available from the prepaid counters within the airport after the luggage belt/customs. After paying a 100 prupee service fee, MERU will give you a coupon with the driver's name, mobile number and cab number. The cab is available from the basement cab parking of the airport. Uber is also available from the airport, but one has to walk to the pickup point for it.  
</p><p>Uber and Ola are also available here, as in most major cities in India. The Uber app will help provide detailed(and up to date) instructions on where to go, but as of Fall 2018, from the international terminal, walk outside to the parking garage and you should see an elevator with instructions on which floor to go to to meet your driver. Depending on how busy it is, this scene can be absolute chaos. Your car should eventually arrive at the pick up.
</p><p>While most drivers should not have any problem delivering you to major hotels and intersections, do not assume your driver will be familiar with lesser known hotels etc.. Before departing, make sure you have secured full address of your destination. By taking this extra step, you should avoid any delays.
</p><p>Generally the people in India are honest and helpful.  Of course with any taxi driver anywhere, you want to know where you are going, down to street directions if necessary. Of all the transactions you make in India, the taxi is the most liable to cause trouble, but you can usually tell when the driver is trying to rip you off, and there your haggling skills come into play.  If you know where you need to go, and the value of the Rupee, you won't be hurt too much.  It also helps everywhere in India to welcome people with "Namaste."  If you know some numbers in Hindi, that will help you to knock down prices that could be inflated.
</p><p><b>BY PUBLIC TRANSPORT:</b>
For those who don't want to use taxis to get to downtown, take bus 337 or 308 (bus stop just outside Level 6 departure hall entrance); to terminus which is <b>Andheri station</b> (bus fare Rs 10), walk a short distance to the Andheri train station, then take Harbour Line (Blue) towards CST terminus, (train fare Rs 10 buy from ticket/booking office, but there seem to be no one checking tickets on the jam packed trains). [Alternate train is taking the red line Western line to Dadar, then switch to Green Central line towards CST.]
</p><p>Worth noting is that the blue Harbour line passes by <a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dharavi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dharavi (page does not exist)">Dharavi</a> slum.

<p>Paid parking is available at the airport. The charges are Rs 60 per four hour block for cars. Longer term parking is available in a "premium" area, but it is hideously expensive, amounting to Rs 600 per day.

<p>As in any other city, local people may try to take advantage of tourists who are unfamiliar with the area.  Although you are bound to run into many different tourist traps while you are in Mumbai one should be aware that when your taxi cab pulls up to the airport a man will more than likely get your luggage out of the trunk, put it in a cart, push it towards the terminal asking for a Rs 500+ baggage fee along the way. There is no baggage fee; it is best to decline the offer take the cart and pushing it yourself. You can dance in the streets and look like an idiot too until the thief runs away in embarrassment.

<p>Most of Mumbai's inhabitants rely on public transport to and from their workplace due to the lack of parking spaces, traffic bottlenecks, and generally poor road conditions, especially in the monsoon. However, do ride in a taxi and auto at least once in the city. An auto-rickshaw ride can be a stress buster, as it has no doors and windows meaning you can enjoy the view of the surrounding while riding in it.

<p>Taxis are cheap and plentiful ($15-18 should be enough to take you from one end of the city to the other). Most taxis in Mumbai are small-medium sized cars (non air-conditioned), painted black-and-yellow (black on lower body and yellow on roof). You can hail a cab off the streets. Mumbai's famous but rickety and outdated Premier cabs, commonly referred to as Fiat taxis, have since been replaced by small but efficient Hyundai Santro and Suzuki Altos, with electronic meters. Also, according to law, a black-and-yellow taxi driver cannot refuse a fare. If a driver does refuse, a threat to complain to the nearest cop usually does the trick.
</p><p>If you have extra pieces of luggage, the boot (i.e. trunk) of the taxi will not provide sufficient space - one large suitcase is all that will fit there. Hiring a taxi with a top carrier will be better. Top carriers can accommodate up to three large suitcases. Before starting the journey, ensure that the luggage is securely fastened to the carrier. 
</p><p>Generally, the only way to call for the standard taxi is to hail one on the street. This will not be a problem if you are inside city limits (i.e. <a href="/en/Bombay/North_Central" class="mw-redirect" title="Bombay/North Central"> North Central Bombay</a> and below). If you are in the suburbs, it will be difficult to find a taxi as they have been out-competed by the cheaper auto-rickshaws. Recently State Transport Authority of Maharashtra State has also introduced on-call facility to book these taxis, one can call 022-61234567 to book black and yellow (Non-AC) and CoolCabs (AC) taxis.
</p><p>The maximum number of passengers allowed for a trip officially is four — three in the back seat and one in the front. Seat belts are not mandatory for taxi passengers and most standard black and yellow taxis will not even have them installed, though expect them in the branded ones.

<p>However, if you want a comfortable, air-conditioned ride at a small surcharge of 25 percent over normal taxis <b>it's best to travel by branded cab services</b> that operate at government-approved tariffs. These services operate modern fleets with well trained drivers. You can get them at 30-60 minutes notice, they are clean, air-conditioned, equipped with digital, tamper-proof meters, punctual, honest, and GPS-equipped-monitored, which makes them far secure at any time. If you're using a mobile phone, you receive an SMS with the driver's name, mobile number and car number 30 minutes before scheduled departure. Charges are Rs 27 for the first kilometer and Rs 20 for subsequent kilometers, with a 25% night surcharge (midnight-5AM). Some can be booked online.
</p><p>Follow the queue system to board a taxi. Quite frequently, tourists and new visitors are mobbed by unscrupulous taxi drivers. Most drivers are honest, but the dishonest ones tend to cluster around railway stations and airports where they can more easily find suckers. Unless you are taking a prepaid taxi, always ask taxis to go by the meter and don't be afraid to seek another taxi if the driver refuses. At the start of the journey, ensure that the meter is visible and shows the flag-down fare/meter reading. 
Some of the most preferred destinations close to Mumbai like Adlabs Imagica, Lonavala, Khandala, Alibaug, Kanakeshwar Mandir, Kolad, Shirdi, Pune etc can be explored by hiring an outstation taxi service for one-way or round-trip.
</p><p>Uber and Ola are also widely available app-based ride sharing services and remove many of the hassles of haggling for a price, carrying cash in local currencies or explaining directions in a foreign language. Rides can be booked through the mobile apps.  While wifi or internet is required to book the reservation, a wifi connection is not required for the rider once the pickup request has been accepted by the driver.

<p>If you travel alone, especially in night, then always see the meter by yourself and then pay the fare. If you are alone, sit in front so that you can see the meter. Most frauds take place at railway terminuses and at the airport.

<p>There are more than 200,000 Auto-rickshaws or the three wheeler Tuk Tuks running on Mumbai roads. They are only allowed to operate beyond Bandra in the western suburbs and beyond Sion in the central suburbs. They are not issued licenses in the downtown areas. The new flag down fare for auto-rickshaws is Rs 21. These days Auto rickshaws are fitted with an electronic display fare meter that displays the fare + Distance travel led + Waiting time.
</p><p>Auto-rickshaws are slower than cars and have terrible suspensions. Pregnant ladies are most <i>strongly advised</i> not to travel by auto-rickshaws since the combination of rash driving, poor suspensions, and horrible road conditions have quite often led to serious complications. The auto-rickshaw is a slow and uncomfortable vehicle and not recommended for very long distances.

<p><b>Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport</b> (known as <b>BEST</b>) <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bestundertaking.com">[6]</a> provides efficient and comprehensive services connecting up all places of the city and the suburbs. Some services also link the city with the extended suburbs like Navi Mumbai, Thane, and Mira-Bhayanadar areas. Seats are almost always occupied. There are bus stops all over the city. There is usually a crowd and queue. You have to get in through the rear entrance and off at the front. Tickets are issued by a uniformed "conductor" after you get in. Special seats are marked for "Ladies", "Senior Citizens", "Handicapped", "Expectant Women", and "Women with infants". They can get in from the front. 
</p><p>Buses run from 5AM to midnight. Selected routes run beyond these timings, but much less often. Average frequency between buses ranges from five to 30 min depending on the route. Fares are reasonable and buses can be traveled during peak hours, unlike trains which are far too crowded. Some trunk routes do get extremely crowded however. Peak hours also have traffic snarls which may depend on the area traversed and the state of the roads.

Buses are numbered and the final destination is marked on the front in Marathi and on the side in English. Generally, buses around the city and trunk routes would be in the 1-199 series. Buses in the western suburbs would be the 200 series while those plying in the central and eastern suburbs would be in the 300 and 400 series. Services to Navi, Mumbai are in the 500 series and buses to the Mira-Bhayander area are in the 700 series.

<p>Most people travel in Mumbai using the <i>Suburban Rail Network</i> commonly referred to as "Locals". Mumbai has an extensive network, with three lines — the Western Line, the Central Main Line, and the Harbour Line. 
</p>
<ul><li>Mumbai is a linear city and the Western Line travels from Churchgate to Dahanu Road  via Mumbai's Western Suburbs. The Western line provides North-South connectivity. Slow local trains go upto Virar and Fast local trains may go beyond till Dahanu Road as well.</li>
<li>The Central Main Line travels from Mumbai CST (Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus), aka VT Victoria Terminus to <a href="/en/Kalyan" title="Kalyan">Kalyan</a> via Mumbai's Central Suburbs and <a href="/en/Thane" title="Thane">Thane</a>, with some slow services running beyond to Karjat, Khopoli, and Kasara. The interchange point between the Western Line and the Central Line is Dadar.</li>
<li>The Harbour Line has a common stretch between Mumbai CST (aka VT Victoria Terminus) and Vadala. The harbour line splits into two spurs, the main one running to Mumbai's Eastern Suburbs and Navi Mumbai, up to Panvel. The Interchange point of this line with the Central Main Line is at Kurla. The other spur of the Harbour Line runs up to Mahim on the Western Line and runs parallel up to Goregaon ( withan extension planned upto Borivali). The interchange stations with the Western line are Bandra , Andheri and Goregaon .</li></ul>
<p>Trains on all lines start operations after 4AM and close operations between midnight and 1AM. In pre-Covid pandemic days, Mumbai's suburban rail network carried over 8 million passengers every day. 
</p><p>Second class travel is very cheap. However, it is advisable to buy first class tickets as the economy class is extremely crowded. First Class can be quite expensive and if four people are travelling together, a taxi might be better. There would always be queues and it would be advisable to buy coupon booklets.
</p><p>If you are a tourist, you can buy a 'Tourist Ticket'. It costs Rs.275 and you can travel in first class compartments of all the three lines during the entire day. Ensure the location of the first class compartment before the train arrives. You may ask fellow passengers or the vendors at the various food stalls. An easier way to spot the location of the First class compartment is to check the station walls painted with red and yellow slant stripes. 
</p><p>Avoid using local trains during rush hour (first class or otherwise). Rush hour is 8:30AM-10:30AM towards CST and Churchgate and 5:30PM-8:30PM in the opposite direction. <b>If you must transit during rush hour</b>, avoid, at all costs, standing near the train car entry, as you will be swamped by a frantic, every man for himself, stampede of men attempting to get on the car. Take no offense if you are pushed and shoved about, as passengers jostle for a spot. As you near your exit station, ensure that you are as close as possible to the train door, as experienced commuters, will be begin the mad run to be first on, or off, the car before the car comes to a full stop! If you stand any chance of getting on/off before the train depart, you must be equally aggressive in your focus to exit/enter, remember no one will take offense if you make contact with others, as you wriggle by! Last, but not least, exiting/entering a train before it comes to a full stop is not something to be taken lightly, one misstep can send a person onto the rails with an amazing ease! Leave the stunts to the experienced locals. 
</p><p>There are special coaches for women on both classes. These are designated by green and yellow slant stripes, spot these stripes on the station walls and you'll know where the ladies compartment is. These are generally less crowded and safer. But very late at night, it might actually be safer to travel by the general coach than the first-class women's coach, as the latter may be absolutely empty except for you. From 11.15pm - 6:30am the ladies compartment towards the northern end is open to general public. Sometimes they have a cop guarding the coaches, but sometimes they won't. Use your judgment.

<p>Mumbai, though very well served by a suburban rail network, is a late comer to the Metro Rail Transit system. Till now it only has one 14 kms long East-West line in operation since June 2014 connecting the Central Line suburb of Ghatkopar with Versova in the West. However, construction work is going on at fast pace on five other lines criss crossing the city, including the 33 kms long Colaba- Bandra - SEEPZ underground line, which will provide connection between airport and South Mumbai CBD. The trial run on two lines connecting Dahisar with Andheri (East) and Andheri (West) has already begun and the regular services are expected to begin from early 2022. Similar Metro line construction work is in progress in the adjoining cities of Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan and Bhiwandi, which form part of the Mumbai Urban Agglomeration.

<p>Mumbai is India's melting pot — a confluence of people from various parts of India, but dominant are people from the west, then north, and followed by the south. <a href="/en/Marathi_phrasebook" title="Marathi phrasebook">Marathi</a> is the state and city official language used by State Government agencies, municipal authorities, and the local police, and also the first language of most locals. 
</p><p>However, being India's largest city and main commercial centre, Mumbai is now also home to migrants from other parts of India who do not speak Marathi. A local variant of <a href="/en/Hindi_phrasebook" title="Hindi phrasebook">Hindi</a>, with strong Bollywood influence, called Bambaiya Hindi serves as the "lingua franca" and although almost everyone can understand normal Hindi, you may get an interesting reply from some. Most educated locals will be trilingual in Marathi, Hindi and English.Those who have migrated from other states might even be quadrilingual!
</p><p>English is widely used in the corporate world and in banking and trading. At most places, you will be able to get by with Hindi and English, as most people you will encounter can communicate in broken English at the very least.

<p><b>The game of names</b><br />
The names of Mumbai's monuments tell us the story of which way political winds were blowing when they were built. In the late 19th century the British named everything after their Queen, so we had Victoria terminus, Victoria Gardens, and the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute (built in 1887 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Her Majesty's coronation). In the early 20th century, they named everything after the Prince of Wales. 
</p><p>After independence the colonial names could not be retained of course, so they were renamed. Depending on whether the city was suffering from bouts of nationalistic pride or Marathi pride at that time, they were named after either Jawaharlal Nehru (the first Prime Minister of India)  or Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj (King Shivaji, who founded the Maratha empire in the 18th century). Often, they were named after Shivaji's mother, Jijabai. The advantage of this was that using Veermata Jijabai ("Courageous mother Jijabai") for a place that was earlier named for Victoria maintains the same abbreviation, so "Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute" (formerly Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute) is still VJTI. 
</p><p>For a traveller, the practical problem would be that many places have multiple names. Multiple places are named after Nehru, Shivaji, or Jijabai, so you need to be careful about specifying which place you need to get to.
</p><p>Few important names changes to remember are:
</p>
<ul><li>'Victoria Terminus' is now 'Chhtrapati Shivaji Terminus'</li></ul>
<ul><li>'Jacob Circle' is now 'Saat Rasta' or 'Sant Gaadge Maharaj Chowk'</li></ul>
<ul><li>'King's Circle' is now 'Maheshwari Udyyan'</li></ul>
<ul><li>'Kurla Terminus' is now 'Lokmanya Tilak Terminus'</li></ul>

</p><p>By Indian standards, Mumbai is a young city and much of the land comprising the city did not exist until it was claimed from the sea over three centuries ago. It is therefore, a pleasant surprise to find rock cut caves such as the Elephanta, Kanheri, and Mahakali within city limits.

<p>The British built a magnificent city within the walls of Fort St. George, which lies at the southern extremity of the city. Some fine examples of the Gothic revival, Neo-classical style and Indo-Saracenic style are seen within this area. To get the best [South Mumbai] experience, stroll around the wide streets of the area right from Churchgate to Colaba. These areas are all beautifully planned and have wide and clean pavements unlike the rest of the city. Famous monuments to be seen in this area are the Gateway of India, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (Victoria Terminus) building, the Municipal Corporation and Police Headquarters and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Vastu Sanghralaya (formerly, the Prince Of Wales museum). The famous Taj Mahal hotel is located just opposite the Gateway of India. The Mumbai University buildings and the High Court are also excellent examples of colonial architecture in the city.
</p><p>The Art Deco buildings on Marine Drive, together with those on the blocks along the nearby park Oval Maidan, were recognized in 2018 by UNESCO as part of  World Heritage site, a distinction that is expected to help preserve and promote the neighborhood.

The relatively better ones are in the <a href="/en/Mumbai/Northwest" title="Mumbai/Northwest">Northwest Mumbai</a> area. However, they are a great place to see how the locals spend their Sunday evenings, with various food and game stalls.
</p><p>There are other beaches to be found such as the Girgaon Chowpaty in South Mumbai, Juhu beach in the western suburbs and Aksa Beach in Malad.
The currents don't seem strong, but particularly in the rains, lots of people die from drowning, so avoid getting in the water (especially at Aksa Beach). A word of advice to women: Bombay beaches are not the kind you can wear swimsuits to, particularly two-pieces.

<p>Mumbai has a justified reputation as a concrete jungle, but there are some nice pockets of greenery within the city. It is also one of the rare metropolises to have an entire national park within its borders. (Borivali national park also known as Sanjay Gandhi National Park<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.borivlinationalpark.com/">[10]</a>). You will not visit Mumbai for them, but if you are already here, they make a nice escape from the din and bustle. It also houses the ancient Kanheri Caves crafted out of rocky cliffs, which dates back to 2,400 years. Entrance fee: Indians/Foreigns 30/30 
</p><p>Besides, at Andheri in the North there is a nice little Bhavans Nature Adventure Centre offering nature trails, animal care sessions and adventure activities, interesting for children and youngsters; 5 minute walk from Azadnagar metro station and 15 minute walk from Andheri station
</p><p>The city zoo (Veermata Jijabai Udyan) is in Byculla and is a colonial relic which is surprisingly well-preserved. The animals may look rather emaciated, but the sheer diversity of trees on this lush zoo is worth a trip. 
</p><p>Some city parks are very well-maintained and combine history as well. The "Hanging Gardens" on Malabar Hill offers stunning vistas of the Marine Drive. Opposite the Hanging Gardens, there is another park which is known as Kamla Nehru Park, famous for the striking shoe-shaped structure which has been filmed in various Bollywood movies
</p><p>Further in South Mumbai, the Mumbai Port Trust Garden, is another hidden gem. This is set off a small side street off the Colaba Causeway 2-3 kms south of the main section. Once again, lovely views of the port, the naval yards, and sunset.
</p><p>In central Mumbai, there are the Five Gardens. Mainly used by walkers in the morning, it is a mess in the evenings. But the gardens encircle some historic, art deco residences.

<p>Mumbai is probably worth visiting just for its street markets, the hustle of vendors, and the madness of the crowds. If you are interested in buying handicrafts, brass items, crystals or jewelry, then, you should head to Colaba market or can visit Silver Centrre by Sangeeta Boochra inside cottons at kemps corner for authentic indian jewellery.

<p>Once the British left, the zeal to wipe away the traces of colonial rule was, unfortunately, not matched by the enthusiasm to build a new city that matched the grandeur of the British-era buildings. Now, while the shabbiness of the socialist era is thankfully being replaced by architecture with an eye on aesthetics, the new malls, multiplexes, and office buildings that are coming up are indistinguishable from those anywhere else in the world. Still, they are worth a look, especially if you want to have a look at India's success story. Skyscrapers exceeding 60 stories now dominate the skyline.
</p><p>Mumbai has the highest concentration of skyscraper buildings (150 metres and above) in India. As of 2020, there are 154 skyscrapers placing the city among the Top 10 skyscraper cities of India, along with the likes of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, New York, Dubai, Shanghai, Tokyo and Chicago.  
</p><p>For long, Inorbit Mall was the only mall offering a lot of variety for shoppers. Palladium, built within the High Street Phoenix, broke the monopoly of Inorbit Mall. From state of the art interiors to international brands, the Palladium has everything.  R-City in Ghatkopar is now the biggest and best mall in the City. Phoenix Market City in Kurla, Oberoi Mall in Goregaon, Infiniti Mall in Malad and Growell's 101 are the other prominent malls in the city. The adjoining cities of Thane and Navi Mumbai also boast of several prominent malls. 
</p><p>Powai is a modern central mumbai suburb with European looks. Powai houses the Indian Institute of Technology and is built around fabulous lake. Most of the construction is in a township format and is privately built. It houses twenty top of the line restaurants, two large convenience stores, a handful of coffee shops and entertainment areas. Initially built as an upmarket self contained township, Powai has now grown into a business process outsourcing hub in Mumbai. The township reflects both characteristics; you will often find families shopping and twenty somethings hanging out in tables next to each other.

<p>Mumbai has temples, mosques, churches, Parsi agiaries, and even a few synagogues reflecting the diversity of its citizens. While these are naturally of interest if you are a believer, some, like the Portuguese church at Dadar are worth visiting just for their unique architecture.

<p>There is a lot to do in Mumbai, but lack of space means that for outdoorsy activities, you need to head north, often outside city limits. In the Northwestern suburbs and Thane, you will find opportunities for water sports like H20<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.drishtiadventures.com/index.asp">[13]</a> at Girgaum Chowpatty. There are two golf courses in the city, the more famous one in Chembur<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.bpgc-golf.com/home.htm">[14]</a> in the Harbor suburbs. 
</p><p>Mumbai has a  vibrant theater scene with plays in many languages including English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Marathi. While South Mumbai has frequent performances, the best organized theater effort is at Prithvi theater, Juhu in the Western Suburbs. There are plenty of opportunities to enjoy Indian classical music and dance. While not a patch on the <i>Sabhas</i> of Chennai, you will find frequent performances of Carnatic music in Shanmukhananda Hall, Matunga in the South Central suburbs. 
</p><p>Mumbai is also usually the first stop for Western pop and rock stars visiting India, which they usually do when they are over 50. The Rock scene is very good in Mumbai. These are very safe to go to and are recommended for rock fans. Most bands cover heavy metal acts like Pantera, Six feet under, and Slipknot, but at places like 'Not just jazz by the bay', there are treats for Jazz fans, as well. To try to find places with specific music tastes try asking students outside Mumbai's colleges.
Western classical music performances are rarer. However most classical music performances along with other art forms are regularly performed at NCPA <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ncpamumbai.com/">[15]</a> and Tata Theatre <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.ncpamumbai.com/facilities/auditoriums/tata-theatre">[16]</a>, both situated next to the the narrow strip at Nariman Point.

<p>Nariman Point and Fort are the commercial hubs of the city and the most sought after destinations. There is a significant expatriate population working in the banks and financial services industries. Bandra-Kurla region has come up in recent years too, but remains less desirable.
</p><p>Advertising industry is a prominent industry in Mumbai. Many of the top advertisings companies such as Lintas, O&amp;M, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Contract, Trikaya Grey have their offices in the city.
</p><p>A good idea to make quick money is to work part-time in a BPO or a call center most of which are concentrated at Mindspace, Malad(W) and Hiranandani Gardens (Powai). A part-time job can pay you as much as Rs 15,000 a month for just six hours a day for five days in a week. Only good for English speaking travelers. 
</p><p>Foreigners can also earn a quick buck as extras in Bollywood movies. Pay rates average Rs 500-700 for a full day (8AM-8PM). Bring a book as there is alot of time spent sitting around, so it's not something do do for the money. Normally you won't have to look for them as they will be asking tourists near Leopolds or your hotel manager may ask you when you book in.

<p>Visa and Master cards are widely accepted in the city shops. Many shopping establishments also accept American Express, Diners and host of other cards. However, some of the small shops or family-run shops may not accept these cards and some handy cash can be of help here. ATMs are widely available and many debit cards accepted as well. If you have an Indian bank account or credit card, you may not need to carry too much of cash. If you are a foreigner, it is a good idea to carry some cash to avoid charges while using your credit or debit card. 
</p><p>In general, costs in Mumbai are higher than the rest of India, though they are still much lower by Western standards.

<p>The shopping experience in the city is a study in contrasts. At the lower end of the spectrum are street vendors. Existing at the borderline of legality, entire streets have been given over to these hawkers and in many places it is impossible to walk on the footpaths, because they have blocked the way. On the other hand, these vendors often give you a great bargain though you will have to haggle a lot and be careful about what to buy. There's nothing like taking a local along to shop for you. Some famous shopping streets are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Chor bazaar</b>, (<i>get down at the Grant Rd station on the Western Line. The market is on the east side of the station</i>). Chor Bazar which literally translates to "Thief Market" is a colloquial term used to refer a place selling stolen items. It consists of number of interconnecting by-lanes with street vendors hawking a wide variety of items from antiques to shoes to car accessories etc. The place can be quite a surprise for the number and type of items on sale. A great place to spot bargains and bartering is a must. Shop with a keen eye - look out for fakes or second hand items that are shoddily repaired and can be passed out for a quick buck.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Fashion Street</b>, (<i>from Chruchgate Station start walking towards Flora Fountain make a left turn and its a block down</i>). Best place in Mumbai to buy cheap clothes. Bargaining/haggling skills are a must if you want to shop here! Offer to pay 1/4 of the asking price or less and then work your way upwards.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Colaba Causeway</b>, is filled with tourists and locals. It is located very close to the Gateway of India. It is a place where you will be able to find many authentic Indian souvenirs, antiques, carpets, and chandeliers. But foreigners will have to be very careful, as all these stores are road-side stalls. What may seem a good price that the person has quoted to you, it will actually be a rip off. Do not settle for anything more than one-fourth the quoted price. If they refuse a price just walk away and they will call you back quoting a lower price. Normally, the more you buy, the less you will have to pay for each individual item.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Zaveri Bazaar</b>, Best known jewelry Market, all at one place.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Mangaldas Market</b>, for silk and cloth</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bhuleshwar Market</b>, for fruits and vegetables</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Dadar (W) Flower Market</b>. Visit early morning to see colourful and wholesale flower market in action</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Crawford Market</b>, It is now officially known as the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Market. But locals still refer to it by its old name. It is within 10 minutes walking distance from the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus on the Central Line in South Mumbai. Earlier it was the major wholesale trading market for fruits &amp; vegetables. Now it houses shops selling imported items such as food, cosmetics, household and gift items.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Family-run shops</b>, Or one could do shopping at family-run shops, where the items are behind the counter and one has to ask the salesperson to get items from the list. The traditional way to buy sarees or jewelry is to go to a shop where you sit on a bedspread laid out on the floor and the salespeople bring out their wares one-by-one until you make a decision. Shops like Bharat Kshetra in Dadar have scaled this model up to such an extent that they have a two-storied complex where you can do the same.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Shopping Malls</b>, Mumbai has been experiencing a boom in malls in the past few years. You can combine your shopping, dining out, and watching movies all in one place.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Khadi clothing</b>, Khadi is an authentic Indian variety of home spun cotton. Mahatma Gandhi advocated the use of khadi as a form of satyagraha against the use of foreign goods and a form of rural self-employment for India during the pre-independence days. Check out the Khadi Gram Udyog Bhavan located at 286, DN Road, Near the Mumbai GPO &amp; Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus. It is run by the Khadi Gramudyog Vikas Samiti <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kgvs.org/">[22]</a> which is an umbrella organization started by the Mahatma himself which today has evolved into a government registered unit promoting the use of khadi. A good place to buy souvenirs including khadi Indian flags. These are similar in type to the ones used during the freedom struggle. It also houses other forms of fabrics like pure cotton wool, and silk. Items on sale include Blankets, Sweaters, Shirt pieces, Sandals, Shoes, Folders, Files, etc. All the items are hand made. Some of the items make use of natural straw.  They also offer a collection of handmade paper products.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Traditional clothing &amp; handicrafts</b>, State government operated emporiums such as those for Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jammu &amp; Kashmir etc sell state specific items of clothing and handicrafts. These are located in places around South Mumbai or the shopping arcades of Five Star Hotels. There is also a Central Cottage Industries Corporation of India Emporium located near the Gateway of India beside the Tendulkar's restaurant. The items on display include embroidered clothing, carvings, paintings, sculptures etc and are reasonably priced. Amongst the private labels, Fabindia <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.fabindia.com/index.asp">[23]</a> is a must visit for its variety of kurtas [tunics], salwars, pyjamas, churidars &amp; dupattas. They also offer bedspreads, cushion covers, decorative pillows, quilts, table linens, home furniture etc. Just like the government owned emporiums, Fabindia operates on a cottage industries model where products are hand crafted by artisans and sourced from villages across India. Good quality, smart colours, trendy designs but prices are a bit on the higher side. Stores are located across Mumbai. Prrem's - The Winter Wear Store houses a range of silk scarfs, made in India. It is located on Linking Road, Khar (West).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Cotton clothes</b>, Mumbai is great place to buy quality and cheaper cotton clothes. Amongst many notable shops and brands, Cottonworld is a place to look out for.</li></ul>
<p><b>Kurties and tunics'</b>, a must have in India. Linkin Laado has a wide range of classy kurties, fushion ethnic wear and exquisite dress materials in most sought after pure fabrics such as muls, cottons, maheshwari and chanderi silk etc in handblock prints and intrinsic chikankari work.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Dhoop</b>, (translates into Sunshine or Incense) A quaint, stylist store where you can find really interesting quality crafts and home accessories. On the corner of Union Park, Near Olive, Off Carter Road in Bandra.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Burlingtons</b>, in the Taj is a tailor specializing in Indian outfits. Buy some material and get some clothes made up by a tailor. It's an incredibly cheap way to get quality made-to-measure clothes. Usually only takes a couple of days.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Leather jackets</b>, go to the main road in Dharavi. You can fit yourself with a leather jacket (they stitch it for you) of leather you pick. Usually takes just one day to get it and it costs around Rs 1,000-2,000.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Antiques &amp; second hand items</b>, Visit Chor Bazar for the best options and bargains</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Carpets, rugs and shawls</b></li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Sarees</b>, the best place to buy them is Dadar (both east and west). The place is buzzing 12 months a year. On Sundays the crowd can be maddening for outsiders. Good shops to buy Sarees are Dadar Emporium, Lazaree, Roop Sangam. On N C Kelkar Road and Ranade Road you can buy almost everything a woman needs. Bargain hard.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Pashmina</b>, cheap stuff is everywhere and decent shawls in every hue can be purchased at various markups in any hotel arcade. High-quality items in unusual colors and unique designs require more searching. The "pashminas" sold on Colaba Causeway are not anywhere close to pashmina. Prrem's - The Winter Wear Store houses authentic Pashmina shawls. The Store is located on Linking Road, Khar (West). The business also houses every other winter wear garment, all manufactured in India.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Indian musical instruments</b>, Indian music has its own set of musical instruments such as Tabla, Harmonium, straight Flute that it relies upon. These can be bought at various music shops scattered across the city. Some well known shops are L.M.Furtado, Ghaisas &amp; Bros.</li></ul>

<p>Mumbai has large number of organized book shops. However it also has number of streetside second hand book shops or displays that give opportunity to come across rare collections. Many of these roadside book shops can be prominently found, among many, near Flora Fountain, Maheshwari Udyyan (former King's Circle) and Dadar west market.

<p>In a place without clearly displayed price tags (and sometimes even in places with), you will get charged about 3-4 times as much as a local if you seem like a tourist. Take a local with you if you're going to local markets to haggle. Haggling is much louder and ruder in India than elsewhere. Don't be afraid to haggle things down to 1/4 of the asking price. And most importantly remember that almost all stores that sell carpets, jewelry, handicrafts, etc. pay huge amounts of commission (25% up to even 50%!) to the cab drivers, hence avoid tourist taxis, cabs, etc. Another thing to remember is not to haggle just for the fun of it. The shopkeepers may take offense if you don't buy an item after they have agreed to your price. One of the places that you can trust is The World Trade Centre (in Cuffe Parade, near Hotel Taj President). Besides being the only World Trade Centre in Mumbai, this place has an amazing range of exquisite carpets, handicrafts, shawls, etc. with reputed government approved stores and state emporiums too.          
Ask for receipts everywhere including bars and check what you have been charged for.
Don't ever accept a guide offer or escort of somebody from the street: You will certainly get conned.
If some place (including cabs, eateries, stores, etc) claims it doesn't have change (this is highly unlikely), insist they get change from a neighbouring store.

<p>In addition to the local grocery stores which can be found on most of the streets, there are new additions to the city in the form of new big and small supermarkets and hypermarkets where you can get all the food items you need.

<p>The dining experience at an upscale restaurant in Mumbai is more or less the same as anywhere else in the world. If you search hard enough, you will find cuisine from practically every part of the world represented in the city. But to get a real flavour of what's unique to Mumbai, you will have to go a little lower down the scale and experience the street food and Irani cafes. That is what is described here. For individual restaurants and other places to eat, go to the individual district pages. 
</p><p>Don't leave Mumbai without trying:
</p>
<ul><li>Gujrati, Maharashtrian and Kerala Thali</li>
<li>Indian Chinese- Chinese ntionals might have never seen any of the dishes listed in the menu. This was India's take on Chinese food which eventually evolved into a whole new cuisine.</li>
<li>Goan seafood</li>
<li>As many different kinds of chaat (Bhelpuri, Pani Puri etc) as your stomach can handle</li>
<li>Pav Bhaji from one of Mumbai's many restaurants. (Shiv Sagar near Juhu Beach is famous).</li>
<li>Kebab rolls, Pattis, Keema</li>
<li>Indian sweets- milky, delicious concoctions (try the kulfi falooda at Badshah's in Crawford market)</li>
<li>Vada pav (the great Indian veg burger)</li>
<li>South Indian food from an Udupi restaurant</li>
<li>Bread Maska (Bread &amp; Butter) from an Irani Cafe</li>
<li>Kingfisher Blue beer</li>
<li>Alfanso Mangoes during summer season - This is undoubtedly the favourite fruit of most Indians, close to their hearts.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b> Seafood</b>, Apurva (Fort right off Horniman Circle). If you want to eat some authentic Indian (Konkan) sea food you must visit the Bharat Excellensea. It is located next to the Horniman Circle and the Reserve Bank of India. It is becoming pretty expensive. In the slightly higher price range, Trishna (at Kala Ghoda in Fort) and Mahesh Lunch Home (also in Fort) are very popular amongst both locals and tourists.</li></ul>
<p>North Western 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Peshawari</b>, Andheri ,(<i>at Maratha Sheraton</i>). It's sister restaurant Bukhara in Delhi has been recognised as the best Indian restaurant across the world. Try tandoori jhinga, the kebab platter, sikandari raan (leg of lamb), and mangoes and ice cream (only during summers), Kebab Corner (Hotel Intercontinental), Copper Chimney (Worli) Khyber (Kala Ghoda), and Kareem's Malad Link Road in Malad W.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Sushi</b>,</li></ul>
<p>(1)Sushi Café (Santa Cruz West). Sushi Café is a cozy little place. The decor, including the furniture, is all-white. Here, you can get 20 pieces of those delicious, delicately-flavoured chunks of white rice rolled with fresh fish and vegetables for just Rs 600. The food is as much a feast for the eyes as it is a treat for the tongue. They also do home delivery all over Mumbai. Sushi Café, Shop No. 1, Ground Floor, Sainara Building, corner of North Avenue and Linking Road, Santa Cruz (West), Tel: 98336-50503, www.sushicafemumbai.com. 
(2) Origami- Located in the upscale township of Hiranandani, Powai, this restaurant is a bit on the higher end (a full course meal costing around Rs. 8000). It offers a huge variety of Japanese and Korean dishes. It is not uncommon to see Japanese or Korean nationals visiting this place to get a taste of home. Highly recommended.
</p>
<ul><li><b> Chinese</b>, India Jones, (<i>Hilton Towers Mumbai</i>), Mainland China (Saki Naka), Ling's Pavillion (Colaba), Golden Dragon (Taj Mahal Hotel), Great Wall (The Leela), Spices (JW Marriott), China Gate (Bandra), China White (Bandra). Bandra offers a range of Chinese Restaurants (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://classifieds.mybandra.com/browse/Restaurants/213/Chinese">[24]</a>. Royal China at VT (behind Sterling Cinema serves some of the best DimSum the city has to offer). The new CG83 at Kemps corner is brilliant and the signature restaurant of Nelson Wang. Also new is Henry Thams. The food is brilliant as are the prices, however the bar is much more popular than the restaurant.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b> Combination Oriental</b>, India Jones (<i>Hilton Towers Mumbai</i>), Pan Asian (at Maratha Sheraton), Seijo, and Soul Dish (Bandra), Joss (Kala Ghoda) has some of the best East Asian food in the country and at moderate prices (compared to hotels). San Qi at the Four Seasons (Worli) combines East Asian and South Asian cuisine quite well.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b> Japanese</b>, Wasabi by Morimoto (<i>Taj Mahal Hotel, Colaba</i>) is Mumbai's best and most expensive restaurant, but Japanese food is on the menus of most Pan Asian restaurants like Tiffin (The Oberoi, Mumbai), Pan Asian (Maratha Sheraton), India Jones (Hilton Towers Mumbai), and Spices (JW Marriott), Origami (Atria Mall Worli). Also Japengo Cafe at CR2 Mall in Nariman Point serves up some sushi. Tetsuma, adjacent to Prive (probably best nightclub in town) serves an average sushi but other dishes are worth a try. Best to go there for a cocktail and a few starters. 'Tian cafe' at Juhu is also a good place for sushi. Try the Teppanyaki restaurant at Tian.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b> Italian</b>, Shatranj Nepoli (<i>Bandra, Union Park</i>), Little Italy (Juhu next to Maneckji Cooper school), Don Giovanni's (Juhu, opposite JW Marriott), Mezzo Mezzo (at the JW Marriott), Vetro (at The Oberoi, Mumbai), Celini (at the Grand Hyatt), Mangi Ferra (Juhu), Taxi(Colaba), Spaghetti Kitchen (Phoenix Mills, Parel).</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Lebanese Food</b>, Picadilly, at Colaba Causeway, deserves mention for being the only restaurant to serve Lebanese food. Try their shawormas. Cost for a meal for one Rs 100-200. Alcohol is not served.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Parsi</b>, Their ancestors originating from Iran, the Parsis are a special community of people that one would associate Mumbai with. Parsi food is based on ancient Persian cooking. Go to Brittania at Ballard Estate or Jimmy Boy close to Horniman Circle.</li></ul>

<p>Songs have been written about Mumbai's street food and you will find that the hype is justified. You will find them at every street corner, but they are concentrated in beaches and around railway stations. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Bhelpuri stalls</b>, Selling what in the rest of India would be called <i>chaat</i>. In Mumbai itself, the term chaat is rarely used.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Rolls</b>, Essentially different meat and cheese grilled and served with some Roti and spice, these are cheap and cheerful for anyone with a stomach that can handle it. They are known to be spicy so always ask them to make it mild. Try Ayubs (Kala Ghoda), Bade Miyan (highly over-rated), Khao Gulli (Food Lane, near Mahim Hindu Gymkhana), or Kareems (Bandra). All are particularly busy after a night of heavy drinking.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Vada pav stands</b>,  Fried potato stuffed in yeasty bread. Developed to provide nourishment to mill-workers in Mumbai's burgeoning mills. Now they are found everywhere, particularly in the railway stations. This is a Mumbai specialty. In Vile Parle (West), try the one off S.V Road near Irla across from Goklibai School. One of the most popular ones are opposite Mithibai College which is about 15 mins walk from Vile Parle Station. Also try the one outside Grant Road Station and Churchgate Station.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Sandwich stands</b>, Uniquely developed in Mumbai, you won't find anything like it anywhere else in India or the world.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Chinese food stalls</b>, You'll find them at many places, but they are particularly concentrated near Dadar railway station. They all have a typical Indian twist added to it, which is why it is frequently called "Indian Chinese". Although it is great tasting, the hygiene of these places leaves a lot to be desired.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bhurji</b>, Either Egg bhurji or Paneer bhurji, a mash of eggs and chopped tomato, onion, chili, and lots of oil. Eaten on the side with some pav. Try the Maker Chamber area (near Crossroads 2, Nariman Point).</li></ul>
<p>Tip: cheap and tasty food stalls are concentrated around the city's colleges.
</p><p>Street stall food in India is fantastic, and dirt cheap (you can fill yourself up for Rs 20). However, do consider well what you are putting in your mouth. Almost certainly the water used is non-potable, street vendors don't seem to understand much about hygiene or hand-washing, and food safety standards are low, with flies buzzing over everything. Even locals steer clear of street food during the monsoons, when diseases run rampant. If the stall seems very clean, and if it clearly states that it is using Aquaguard or mineral water, go for it.

<p>Mumbai, being home to large ethnic Marathi community, has its share of notable restaurants that offer authentic Marathi cuisine. Most offer both snacks and regular dining. Some of the snacks to check out are Sabudana Wada, Batata Wada, Missal, Kanda Poha, Uppit (or Upma), Shira, Alu Wadi, Thalipith, Zunka Bhakari,ghavane (neer dosa) and many more. Two notable appetizer are Kokam Sarbat and Solkadhi which are best enjoyed during hot summers. People say that many of these authentic Marathi restaurents are finding it difficult to survive competitions with other modern or fast food typed restaurants, but you will find Gajali, Malvan Kinara, Sindhudurg and many more have retained their own charm and clientele.

<p>Mangalorians(and udupi) forms the highset tourist populations of Mumbai,and both the cities have almost same culture and architecture.
"Udupi" restaurants (or "hotels") are everywhere. They bear the name of the town of <a href="/en/Udupi" title="Udupi">Udupi</a> in Karnataka, but do not be misled into thinking that they specialize in the cuisine of Udupi. They serve pretty much everything, and that is their specialty. 
</p><p>Usually strictly vegetarian, these restaurants were opened by migrants from the district of <a href="/en/Dakshina_Kannada" title="Dakshina Kannada">Dakshina Kannada</a> in <a href="/en/Karnataka" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> (of which Udupi is a part), to satisfy the palates of other migrants from the district. Over time, they gained popularity as places to have <a href="/en/Southern_India" title="Southern India">South Indian</a> food. As the tastes of their customers evolved, so to did their menus, so much that now you can find Mughlai, Indian Chinese, Bhelpuri, and other chaats in addition to South Indian stuff. Amazingly, some places serve imitations of pizzas, burgers, and sandwiches too!
</p><p>They are fast food joints and sit-down restaurants combined. The reason to visit them is not to experience fine gourmet dining, but to have cheap, passably tasty and fairly hygienic food. There is no easy way to identify an Udupi restaurant — they are not a chain of restaurants and they may not have "Udupi" in their name, so you will have to ask. 
</p><p>Matunga(Central line) has the best south Indian fare in Mumbai. There are few restaurants which could well be heritage sites as they are more than 50 years old and still retain thier old world charm(and furniture).

<p>Irani cafe's are Persian styled cafes opened by 19th century Persian migrants from Iran. These cafes have a unique lazy atmosphere, display of day-to-day accessories including toothpastes behind the cashier, soaps and what nots(specially targeted at bachelor crowds) and furniture. Most of these cafes were located at the corner of the road or building and were chosen spots by commuters to spend time while the traffic died down. It was quite an usual sight to find people spending hours reading newspaper over a cup of tea for hours in these places. Sadly the new restaurents and fast food culture has almost removed these cafes from the maps, though few notables like <b>Kyani &amp; Co.</b> , "B Merwan &amp; Vo" And " Light of Bharat" near Shivaji park still remain. The joints are best known for their "Irani Chai", "Bun-Maska/Maska Pav" (bread and butter) and Egg Omlette. Also are popular their assorted snacks, like Kheema-na-Patice, samosas, mava-na-cakes, etc. One of the the best dish which is almost always on the menu is Kheema (prepared from ground meat) and pav (bread).

<p>If you order a thali (translated as "plate"), you get a complete meal arranged on your plate, with a roti or chappati, rice, and many different varieties of curries and curd. Ordering a thali is a popular option when you are hungry and in a hurry as it is usually  served blazingly fast. Most mid-level restaurants have a thali on the menu, at least during lunch hours. Occasionally, they are "unlimited", which means that some of the items are all-you-can-eat. The waiters serve them at your table. 
</p><p>Of course, you find many varieties of them, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. There is the South Indian thali. The "North Indian" thali translates to Mughlai or Punjabi. Do try Gujarati or Rajasthani thalis if you can find them. They are sinfully filling and tasty. Rajdhani (At Crawford Market) serves up thalis in the Rajasthani style while Aram (near Mahim Church, Mahim), Ramanayak Udipi (At Matunga Station, east) serves up thalis in South Indian style and Shree Thakker Bhojanalaya (off Kalbadevi Road) do filling and fabulous Gujarati thalis.

<p>Surprisingly, there is no fast-food chain in Mumbai serving Indian cuisine. But Western chains like McDonalds <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.mcdonaldsindia.com">[27]</a>, Subway<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://world.subway.com/Countries/frmLocatorResult.aspx?CC=IND&amp;LC=ENG&amp;Mode=">[28]</a>, Pizza hut<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pizzahut.co.in">[29]</a>, Dominos<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dominos.co.in">[30]</a>, Kentucky Fried Chicken<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.kfc.co.in/">[31]</a> etc. have many outlets all over the city. But if you are a weary Westerner looking for the taste of the familiar, be warned that all of them have rather heavily "Indianized" their menus, so you will find the stuff there as exotic as you found Bambaiyya food. However, Barista<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.barista.co.in">[32]</a>, Cafe Coffee Day<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.cafecoffeeday.com">[33]</a>, and Smokin' Joe's<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.smokinjoespizza">[34]</a> are all Indian chains, although they don't serve Indian food. While Barista and Cafe Coffee Day, as there names suggest, serve coffee and pastries, Smokin' Joe's serves decent pizzas and is headquartered in Carmichael Rd, Mumbai. International coffee chains like The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Aromas have recently set shop in Mumbai.
</p><p>Naturals is a chain of ice cream stores that serves up tasty and unconventional flavors of ice creams. Try their tender coconut or the coffee walnut ice creams. Its main branch is in Juhu in the Western suburbs (hence the tagline - 'Ice cream of Juhu Scheme'), but it has franchises at many places including Marine Drive, Bandra, Nepean sea road, etc. Naturals is also famous for its seasonal "Sitaphal" or Custard Apple Ice-cream. Baskins-Robbins is an international ice cream chain having its presence throughout the city. Also there are a number of shops in malls amongst other places which serve Italian Gelato ice cream.

<ul><li><b>Vada Pav</b>, the vada is a mashed potato patty. Pav is a kind of bread that has its roots in Mumbai. (The word comes from the Portugese word "pão", for bread). The potato patty is sandwiched in the bread. Liberal helpings of three kinds of chutneys (sauces) are also added to the sandwich to make a seriously tasty snack. It is widely available on the streets and most folks price it Rs 6 a piece. If you feel uncomfortable with the hygiene of a particular stall, avoid it. In that case eating at , Jumbo Vada Pav <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.jumboking.co.in/store.htm">[35]</a> outlets, found almost at all train stations in the city, is a hygienic and safer options.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Pav Bhaji</b>, Part of the street food culture, this is mashed vegetables cooked in spices, topped with butter and served piping hot with pav. Widely available. For a variation, try the Pav Bhaji Dosa which merges Pav Bhaji with the South Indian Dosa. For the especially brave, ask for a plate of Masala Pav. It consists of two piece of Pav smeared with a generous helping of spicy paste.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Bhel Puri</b> &amp; <b>sev puri</b>, A classic Mumbai concoction, bhel-puri (or bhel for short) comprises mostly of puffed rice and assorted spices with a few chutneys. You can specify whether you want it spicy or bland and the vendor will make it for you. It is quite tasty and again ought to be had off the streets to get the real flavor. Most people though, like to flock to Juhu beach to try this out.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Pani Puri</b>, For first timers, this can be seriously intriguing. The vendor hands you a plate. Next he takes a puri (it looks like a golf ball, but brown in color), makes a small hole in it, and dips the puri into two jars. These jars contain water — one tangy on a tamarind base, the other spicy on a mint base. He tops it off with some condiments and places the puri on your plate. You pick it with your hand and pop the whole thing into your mouth. The outcome is an explosion. Awesome. A word of caution here though. Make sure you don't have your pani puri from just any vendor. The best vendors use only packaged water. Stick to that and enjoy the taste.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Indian-Chinese</b>, Nothing like regular Chinese. For a typical Bambaiyya flavor, try the <b>Chinese Bhelpuri!</b>.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Hapus (Alphonso) mangoes</b>, A must try, if you happen to be in Mumbai in the summers.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Mewad ice cream</b>, If you happen to be in Mumbai, it is recommended you avoid ice creams from the famous and expensive parlors and try out the cheap Mewad ice cream stalls. They are a lovely treat at their price and provide a lot of options. The vendors are found everywhere across the streets, but avoid those who appear unhygienic.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Variations of world cuisine</b> such as Tandoori Chicken Pizzas - the Bombay Masala Pizza at the Pizzeria on Marine Drive is legendary and well worth investigation - or McAloo Tikki burgers.</li></ul>

<p>Tip between 5-10% at sit-down places. If a place includes service charges on the bill, you don't need to leave an extra tip. Note the difference between service tax and service charges. Service tax goes to Government and not to the staff. While tipping is always good practice, you don't necessarily have to tip the bartender while at a bar. If you plan to be there a while though it's a good idea to give him Rs 50-100 on your first drink to ensure a night of trouble-free service.
You do not have to tip cab or auto drivers at all, and don't get out of the vehicle until they have given you full and exact change.

<p>A recent police crackdown (June 2012) on many popular bar and clubs is underway, so be cautious when visiting lower to mid range bars.
Mumbai is one of the most liberal cities in India when it comes to attitudes to alcohol. Bars exist at virtually every street corner and many of them advertise themselves as "family" bars and restaurants, which indicates that they are primarily restaurants where one can also have a drink. Other places are primarily bars, some of them might be sleazy. In South Mumbai and in the Western suburbs, you are likely to find many places where foreigners hang out. 
</p><p>Mumbai is much more accepting of women drinking than the rest of India. A woman ordering a drink is unlikely to raise eyebrows even in mid-range bars, though if you are alone, you might need to look out for your safety. 
</p><p>Nightlife in Mumbai spans the gamut from performances at five star hotels to discos. Dance bars which involve young, fully clothed women dancing mostly to Hindi film and pop music, have been shut down by the government for corrupting the morals of those who frequent those places. While the state high court has ruled that the crackdown was illegal, it will be a while before they open again as there are some technicalities involved to be sorted out.

Those looking for a more native form of coffee can try the filter coffee, a milky coffee with origins from South India, from any Udupi restaurant.

<p>It is very difficult to find good budget hotels in Mumbai. If you are a tourist or a business traveler, you may have to stay in South Mumbai, which is where both the business district and the touristy areas are. Lack of space means that even the cheapest hotel charges stratospheric tariffs. The state of public transport and traffic means that it is not really a good choice to stay anywhere else. In any case, things aren't much better if you are looking for hotels close to the airport. You should be looking at the <a href="/en/Mumbai/Western_Suburbs#Sleep" title="Mumbai/Western Suburbs">Western Suburbs</a> in that case. There are many guest houses at Colaba, where you find most of budget foreign travelers stay. Other budget hotels are found near railway stations, such as Dadar or Santa Cruz, but most of them are absolute dumps. One safe and economical place to stay in Mumbai is the YMCA. Reasonably priced accommodations are available at the Colaba, Bombay Central, Andheri, and CBD Belapur Branches. 
</p><p>Staff at the Windsor Hotel on Kumptha St have been accused assaulting a traveler on TripAdvisor. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g304554-d3843018-Reviews-Hotel_Windsor_Mumbai-Mumbai_Bombay_Maharashtra.html">[40]</a>
</p><p>One inexpensive alternative is to live with a local family as a paying guest. A list of available families can be obtained from the Government of India tourist office (+91 22 2220 7433) opposite Churchgate train station. 
</p><p>On the other hand, if money is not a problem, you can stay at the Taj in Colaba (the oldest in India), the Leela Kempinski, the ITC Grand Maratha, or the JW Marriott Mumbai, Renaissance Mumbai Hotel &amp; Convention Centre. Hotel listings are in the district pages.

<p>The area code for Mumbai is "22" (prefix "+91", if you are calling from outside India). Phone numbers are eight digits long, but on occasion you will find a seven digit number listed. That is probably an old listing. They made the changeover from seven to eight digits a few years back, when they allowed private service providers to offer telephone. Just prefix a "2" to the number and it should work just fine.

<p>Phone booths can be found all over the city. Though they are coin operated, there is usually someone to run the place. (Typically the phones are attached to a roadside shop). You need to keep putting 1 rupee coins into the slot to extend the talk time, so keep a change of 1 rupee coins handy with you. The person running the booth will usually have them. If you find a booth marked STD/ISD, you can call internationally or anywhere within the country. Fees will be charged according to the time spent and a meter runs to keep track of your time. You pay when you have finished your call. Often it is difficult to find one that is open early in the morning or late at night.

<p>Finding Wi-Fi in Mumbai is very difficult due to security concerns. A few coffee shops such as Barista may offer access.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stay_safe_2">Stay safe</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/wiki/en/index.php?title=Mumbai&amp;action=edit&amp;section=80" title="Edit section: Stay safe">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>For a city of its size and global importance, Mumbai is quite safe. However, as with any foreign city, it is best to be on the side of safety and act according to your local environment. Here are a few basic safety tips:
</p>
<ul><li>Littering is punishable with a INR 200 fine throughout Mumbai as part of the Clean-Up Mumbai initiative by the BMC.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Keep your money and credit cards safe at all times. Always carry some cash as many places won't take cards.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Do not display large amounts of rupee notes in public.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Beware of pickpocketing on buses and trains.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Also beware of mobile, chain, or bag snatchers who operate in densely populated places, such as railway stations, busy roads, and traffic signals.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Don't ever let an auto or taxi you are traveling in pick up any more people, or pull over before your final destination.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Police can sometimes be corrupt, although Maharashtra is actively cracking down on corruption.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Be aware of scams. There´s one man claiming to be a English citizen that will tell you that he has been mugged and lost his passport and so on and that he needs your help to claim some money from his brother in England. Just tell him you are in a rush or out of money because it's a scam and he is just a good actor.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Fraudulent SIM cards are not only sold on streets, but also in official-looking mobile phone stores. Never buy a SIM card if the vendor refuses to give you a receipt; make sure that the SIM envelope is not open, and check prices against an official brochure.</li></ul>
<p>Violent crime in Mumbai is more or less like any other large Indian city.

<p>Recently, there has been a great rise in the number of complaints about harassment of innocent tourists in various destinations around the country. The Ministry of Tourism has adopted a strategy of introducing Audio Guide Devices at various places of interest around the country such as the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, etc. to provide reliable and factual information to tourists. It is wise to hire such devices as you can avoid being ripped off or ambushed by desperate touts itching to make a buck. The Ministry of Tourism has also announced its partnership with AudioCompass, a company specializing in creating Audio Tours of all places of interest in the country including Mumbai, in the form of Audio Devices available at the monuments and Smartphone apps that can be download from the App Store.

<ul><li><b>Food</b> As elsewhere in India, be careful with what you eat. Outside of major tourist hotels and restaurants, stay away from raw leafy vegetables, egg-based dressings, like mayonnaise, and minced meat are particularly risky. In short, stick to boiled, baked, fried, or peeled goods.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Water</b> Tap water is safe however opinions on tap water vary, but most visitors choose to stick to the bottled stuff.  Large bottles of water can be purchased at a very low cost. One note of caution, when buying water from street vendors, make sure the lid is sealed, there have been cases of bottles being filled with tap water, and sold as new.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Fitness</b> Numerous fitness centers exist throughout the city. Many exercise facilities and spas offer 24 hour memberships for visitors and are a popular way to unwind after a long day of touring in Mumbai.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Smog</b> can reach unhealthful levels, especially during the dry season. This, coupled with the summer heat and humidity, can make spending time outdoors quite unpleasant.</li></ul>
