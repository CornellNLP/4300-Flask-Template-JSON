["In Republicans must lean heavily into early voting. Universal mail in voting and ballot harvesting shouldn\u2019t be legal anywhere, but wherever it\u2019s permitted, the GOP must do it better than the Dems in a way that leaves the left in tears for legalizing it in the first place. Longtime Democrat voters harmed by Democrats policies are ready for conservative solutions. We must show up without delay, especially in the bluest cities, and earn their support. It\u2019s time! There is no greater threat to democracy than Joe Biden and his allies trying to deny Americans the right to choose for themselves who to elect as their next President. months ago TODAY, Long Island's own Omer Neutra was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists, and is one of remaining hostages held captive in Gaza. #BringThemHome The America First movement must unite in like never before. We have a nation to save. Today is the GOP presidential primary here in New York. If you haven't voted yet, find your polling place below and vote for President Trump! Zach Bryan\u2019s tribute to Jonathan Diller at last night\u2019s concert was powerful enough, but then this Long Island arena instantly busted out into a proud and patriotic \u201cUSA USA\u201d chant. Was awesome to witness the moment in person. Gives you goosebumps. A blessed and happy Easter, from the Zeldin family to yours. Beautiful tribute by Zach Bryan during his concert on Long Island tonight in honor of NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller. Nothing to see here folks, just Joe Biden and Kathy Hochul canceling Easter tomorrow to make room for yet another day to celebrate the trans community. Stephanie Diller delivered a powerful eulogy today with pride, love, and grace. Elected officials must heed her words demanding action to put law-abiding NYers first and criminals behind bars. Jonathan's death must not be in vain. If Kathy Hochul wants to honor the Diller family, she should stop trying to honor herself instead. Prioritizing criminals over law-abiding citizens and law enforcement is always the wrong answer. Take a hint, take a walk, and come back when you find a backbone to actually lead! Eternally grateful for NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller's heroic service and can\u2019t begin to imagine the unbearable grief his family must be feeling. On my way now to Officer Diller\u2019s wake on Long Island with President Trump. The policies of New York Democrats deliberately turn law-abiding New Yorkers into punching bags for career criminals. Don\u2019t ever expect any apology or regret from these far-left lunatics running the city and state into the ground. R.I.P. NYPD officer Jonathan Diller years since the deadly March order that shipped COVID positive patients into nursing homes, New Yorkers are still waiting for the results of the state's investigation. Hochul continues to cover up the cover up. Grieving families have not forgotten and will not forget. Over winter items were handed out in Jamaica, Queens yesterday! Zeldin Cares, Arctix, and the Bruderman Family Foundation partnered with The Nettwork Inc. and King of Kings Foundation, Inc. to distribute coats and more just in time for this weekend\u2019s cold weather. Nadia Vitel started her day flying to NY to clean her late mother's vacant apartment. She ended her day dead, murdered and stuffed in a duffel bag by squatters. It's insane just how absurd, dangerous and morally wrong NYC's squatter laws have become. This is an INVASION of our border! Joe Biden has the power TODAY to stop this INSTANTLY. Columbia University will never stop the rampant antisemitism across campus if they can\u2019t even define antisemitism. Bernie Moreno is a first generation immigrant from Colombia. Colombian. Whether for partisan hackery, lazy journalism, or both, the NY Times is trying to rebrand a legal immigrant living the American dream into nothing more than just a \u201creally rich white guy\u201d. Really enjoyed traveling to Maryland last night to keynote the Lincoln Reagan Day Dinner. Packed out room of MD Republicans doing their part to save America this November. There is no greater threat to democracy than Joe Biden and his allies trying to block the right of Americans to choose for themselves who to elect as the next President this November. Congrats to Ohio\u2019s next U.S. Senator on his big win in today\u2019s GOP primary! On to victory in November!! Big GOP primary tomorrow in Ohio! Let's send to the U.S. Senate. Honored to be one of Bernie's earliest endorsements. Joe Biden ALREADY has the power TODAY to close the Southern Border RIGHT NOW!! On my way to Green Bay, Wisconsin, to speak on behalf of the President, Donald Trump, at the sold out Brown County GOP fundraiser this evening. See you tonight Wisconsin! While New York Democrats do everything in their power to destroy the state, I remain totally committed to doing everything in my power to make sure this rightward trend in the state continues in and Credit: \u2066\u2069 for this chart. If unelected federal bureaucrats who abuse their power don\u2019t fear that the President is a threat to their job security then the President isn\u2019t doing his/her job correctly either. Miranda Devine is one of the most underrated journalists of my lifetime. She\u2019s not under appreciated though. Many of us are very grateful for her courage and tenacity, issue after issue. We MUST restore EQUAL SCALES OF JUSTICE in the United States Fani Willis' lust for power on this witch hunt screwed her more than Nathan Wade ever did. Millions of disenfranchised Democrats prioritize issues that transcend blind partisan loyalty that have them eager to embrace conservative solutions in They have been failed by a party that emboldens criminals, illegal immigration, and woke ideology. The clowns in charge of New York with their asinine pro-criminal policies need to own this. Every day, NYers hit their breaking point and flee the far-left policies of Kathy Hochul & her fellow Dems. With Hochul and her cohorts committed to racing NY off a cliff, people are convinced their lives would be better elsewhere. Can't blame those leaving for feeling that way. A female victim had both of her legs amputated due to a violent criminal who was out on the streets thanks to Kathy Hochul's \"Less is More\" law. This woman would have her legs if not for Hochul and her merry band of far-left lunatics prioritizing criminals over law-abiding NYers. This criminal illegal alien was arrested but is still on our streets. Illegals come here, commit violent crimes, and are immediately released. Pro-criminal and open border laws will lead to more victims like Chelsea Mora and Laken Riley. Super Tuesday was five days ago and California still has not counted over of the votes. I am all in to do absolutely everything in my power to defeat Joe Biden in to save our country. I want a President who will choose unwavering loyalty to AMERICANS instead of criminal aliens. Joe Biden has the power RIGHT NOW to secure the border. He wants the border open. That is his plan. This is by design. There is no amount of taxes that will ever be too high for Joe Biden and the Democrats. Their hands are always either in your pocket or lurking an inch away. The Biden Admin is once again weaponizing powers to attack political opponents. This time, they are targeting red states using Medicaid regulations. November can't come fast enough!

At Mar a Lago with the and President of the United States. It\u2019s time for Nikki Haley to end her campaign, the Republican Party to unite, and our great country to be saved in November! The U.S. Supreme Court rules against the left\u2019s attempts to remove President Trump from November\u2019s ballot. Its unanimous! Awesome time in Western New York last night and with the amazing . Trump vs. Biden is a choice of either closing the border and getting tough on illegal immigration; or keeping it open and continuing to hand out \"free\" goodies to criminal aliens with your hard earned money. It's an easy vote for DJT for me! The single greatest threat to democracy is Joe Biden and the Democrats removing the right of Americans to vote this November for whoever they want to be the next president. When NY Dems can't win fairly, they do everything they can to destroy the playing field and rewrite the rules. The same leaders who preach to us about \"protecting democracy\" are fully committed to destroying it. They clearly have no regard for the will of voters. President Trump has received more votes in Michigan tonight than all Democrat primary votes COMBINED. It\u2019s possible that the ENTIRE blue wall gets painted red this November. Four consecutive Siena College polls in NY are showing a much closer Trump v. Biden race this year compared to Today is the South Carolina GOP primary.

To find your polling location, visit this website and VOTE VOTE VOTE: Sanctuary state, Dem hack Governor travels to the WH to discuss Biden Border Crisis and at no time calls on the President to use ANY of his CURRENT POWERS to close the border that he opened in the first place. With Gavin Newsom and Kathy Hochul pathetically battling like this for the title of worst and most dishonest Governor in the nation, Americans will always finish in last place, and their own residents will suffer the most damage. ONLY girls should compete in girls sports. That's not debatable or negotiable. Nadia Vitel started her day flying to NY to clean her late mother's vacant apartment.

Then why is a Haitian man who is supposed to be in New Jersey w/ his parole sponsor & who has the ability to apply for work authorization w/ his parole status somehow staying in a migrant hotel outside of the Boston area & has access to a teen girl? Wow. Raul Ortiz, who served as the Chief of U.S. Border Patrol under Biden from August through May says he has never had a conversation with Biden or VP Kamala Harris. Think about how many high profile events happened in that stretch. Haitians under Del Rio\u2026 BREAKING: These are some photos of the classified docs President Biden stored in the garage in Delaware, according to Special Counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report.

A look at the border in Brownsville yesterday evening from our fantastic drone team. Nonstop illegal crossings. Massive amounts of discarded trash and clothing. Enormous line of hundreds migrants gathering for Border Patrol processing after they crossed illegally into Brownsville. Stretches as far as I can see from this perspective. It has been non-stop like this with huge groups in the late every day last three days. NEW: Non-stop illegal crossings continuing here in Brownsville.

The American people deserve more: The epitomized what is actually a nation-wide crisis and Federal investment in water infrastructure is needed to truly address this burgeoning problem. It is incredibly easy to buy a gun in the United states, even compared to countries like Russia, Israel, and China. We need #commonsense action to end gun violence. Today, on we recognize the many achievements of women around the world & the sacrifices of those who have come before us. In the spirit of celebration, let\u2019s pledge to continue fighting for the full range of freedoms that are every woman\u2019s birthright.

We can\u2019t afford to lose it! Today, March was President Trump's deadline for #DACA. Six months later nothing's changed. As Ranking Member of the Rules Committee, I\u2019ve tried to force a vote on this issue more than times, but the Majority has not allowed a single vote. We can't afford to wait! What do Oscar-winning movies Dunkirk, Call Me By Your Name, Phantom Thread, and I, Tonya all have in common? They were made with Kodak film produced in Rochester! Kodak is just one example of the role our local companies play nationally. Despite all the other important issues facing our country, Republicans in Washington are spending yet another week attacking environmental protections. It\u2019s about time they got their #priorities in order. This week I was pleased to welcome Rochester\u2019s own Precision Optics to Capitol Hill. I'm glad to see #Rochester companies getting the recognition they deserve! Due to our efforts and the success I\u2019ve had in creating this opportunity and bringing it to Rochester, our community is now at the very center of world-wide efforts to harness the power of photonics, which will drive technology, daily life, and our economy for decades to come. Let there be light! I was proud to see the progress being made at the Test, Assembly and Packaging facility today. We are doing something that is challenging: we\u2019re working together to build a manufacturing institute that is both and built to last. The winter storm is continuing across our region, canceling many activities and making travel difficult. More than a foot of snow has already fallen but the number of power outages in the county appear to have stabilized. Please stay safe out there! #ROC This situation endangers our national security. It\u2019s time for Jared Kushner to go. No individual with such extensive, previously undisclosed foreign contacts and dealings should be allowed anywhere near top-secret information. According to news reports, a number of nations have sought to use their business relationship with him to assert leverage over White House Jared Kushner\u2019s complex foreign business entanglements and relationship with the president is making him a target for countries abroad, including China and the United Arab Emirates. Voila! The moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for: here\u2019s the restored clock from #Rochester\u2019s New York Central the old and rejoicing in the new! I\u2019ll be visiting our new train station this afternoon to unveil it, displayed for all visitors to see. It will be a testament to our past as we look to the future with our new train station! One lead would lead to another after conversations with archivists, historical societies, antique dealers, and railway officials. Now, this clock from the early has been fully restored and is back in working order. Back in August, I announced that my office had located the Master Clock from Rochester\u2019s New York Central Station. It was a remarkable discovery. #ROC Do you enjoy a work week, sick leave and vacation days, and guaranteed safe working conditions? Then you have unions to thank! I proudly support American workers and their right to organize as #SCOTUS considers #JanusvAFSCME. from the FCC\u2019s disastrous decision to limit a fair internet for all. Our open internet is crucial in keeping our country informed and connected. #NetNeutrality protects innovators and small businesses\u2014they can't afford efforts to undermine the open internet. #NetNeutrality means consumers\u2014not big what websites and applications we see online. The took away a free and open Internet. I am supporting legislation that will bring #NetNeutrality back. We\u2019re seeing a true cultural shift that\u2019s forcing many institutions, from the U.S. Military to the NFL, to address domestic violence. That\u2019s why we need to reauthorize this landmark legislation before it expires in September to continue giving survivors the services they need. It has reduced cases of domestic violence by percent since and helped change the conversation surrounding domestic violence. No longer is this issue solely a private matter that goes undiscussed in the media or the halls of Congress. This afternoon, I\u2019ll be touring and discussing the importance of Congress and President Trump quickly reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Co-authoring this law is one of the most important accomplishments of my career. There is so much more that must be done but the Majority in Congress won\u2019t even allow an open debate on commonsense proposals that could keep our kids and family members safe. As I said then, thoughts and prayers alone are not enough \u2013 we need action to combat the gun violence epidemic. While I\u2019m pleased to see President Trump direct Attorney General Sessions to ban bump stocks I\u2019m left to wonder what took so long. I\u2019ve been a cosponsor of H.R. the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, to ban bump stocks since October. That\u2019s when a shooter used a bump stock to target concert goers in Las Vegas in what became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Did you know that New York State ranks third highest in the nation for the number of African American-owned firms? I will continue to support businesses that strengthen our local economy and make #ROC a great place to work & live. So proud to help cut the ribbon on today! #ROC Way to go, ! The are as dedicated as they come, and I\u2019m proud to fight alongside them every step of the way for strong airline safety reforms. Happy #ROC! The unlawful & dangerous elimination of the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPPP), which helps million people nationwide, is outrageous & I\u2019m pleased that is taking action. More here: Proud to stand with the families this morning and fight alongside them for strong airline safety reforms that protect our skies for all Americans. Our simplest job in Congress is to keep American families safe. A long-term budget deal must consider what kind of world we are leaving behind for our kids and grandkids. I urge Republicans in Congress to reject the extreme #DirtyBudget. We must defend people, not polluters. Happy Mr. Douglass is a point of pride for #ROC & that\u2019s why I was proud when Congress passed the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission Act, which established a commission to carry out programs that honor his life work. I\u2019ve been sounding the alarm on for years, including calling on to stop its routine use of antibiotics in food animals. They\u2019ve heeded my call on chicken, but it\u2019s time they listen to consumers and in beef and pork as well. It\u2019s unconscionable that #POTUS continues to drag his feet & it begs the question: how far will he go to protect #Putin? It\u2019s been weeks since #POTUS defied Congress by not placing new sanctions on Russia. This is required by a law that Congress passed last summer by a vote in the Senate and a vote in the House. .\u2019s threatens civil rights for Americans with disabilities and undercuts the #ADA. I was proud to speak out against it last night at the Rules Committee. Watch me here: Trump\u2019s is bad for all Americans. We don\u2019t need a \u201cplan\u201d that guts clean air & water protections & gives away our #publiclands. As a member of I\u2019m proud to push for infrastructure solutions: Update: the Building Blocks of STEM Act, a bill I cosponsored, is up for a vote on the House floor today. This legislation would improve our understanding of how to increase young girls\u2019 participation in #STEM & diversify the face of science. I was pleased to announce a new federal grant for the Medical Center that will help Dr. Bidlack & her team continue their groundbreaking work in #opioid addiction research. Thankfully, the #TrumpBudget request stands little to no chance of being enacted. #POTUS campaigned on protecting hardworking & middle-class Americans but his actual proposal flies in the face of that pledge while further indebting our nation by trillion & cutting key programs like student aid, #Medicare, #Medicaid & transportation by billions of dollars. What\u2019s worse, it does nothing to balance the trillion hole the #GOPTaxScam created & fails to comply with the bipartisan budget agreement Congress passed last week. The #TrumpBudget is one of the most ill-conceived I\u2019ve seen and his proposed cuts would devastate countless domestic priorities that so many families count on. Just finished a press event in my #ROC office! Thank you to the leaders from our Community Health Centers and Dr. Bidlack from URMC for coming in to talk about your important work. Thanks to their efforts we haven\u2019t seen a single regional crash since. Our skies are safer today because of them. They continue to turn their grief into powerful action by traveling to and from Washington, D.C., often at their personal expense, to protect the safeguards they secured. I\u2019m proud to stand with them now and always. years ago, our nation experienced a devastating plane accident that impacted so many families across WNY. Through unspeakable tragedy, the families pushed Congress & the to learn from their loss & create reforms that better protect travelers. . has tried repeatedly to limit the #CFPB\u2019s ability to protect consumers & now they\u2019re getting their wish. It's unconscionable that Director Mulvaney, appointed by #POTUS, is preparing to defang this institution & eviscerate consumer protections. There are million people in the U.S. who owe a combined trillion in student debt. In fact, the bill\u2019s sponsor called students\u2019 debt a \u201cluxurious hammock.\u201d Our young people are our future and we should be making it easier for them to attain degrees, not harder. . is moving a bill that would slash student aid by more than billion dollars over the next years & let predatory colleges that fail to meet education standards access student aid money. Who watched the for last night? Check out this story from the on when to tune in and see #ROC\u2019s qualifying athletes compete for gold: Sadly, #ROC is not immune to the #opioidepidemic that is tearing so many communities apart. These latest stats are just more proof that Congress must pass the Pharmaceutical Stewardship Act & the Preventing Overprescribing for Pain Act. Proud to lead this bipartisan and bicameral effort with and more than of my colleagues to protect #NY\u2019s coastline from the dangerous drilling plan. Good luck to Morgan Schild from Pittsford, a Team USA Freestyle Skier who\u2019s competing tonight in the #Olympic preliminaries! Our community is so proud of all its athletes that made it to the winter games and we are rooting you on from #ROC. In this country, we hold parades to honor our veterans, not our political leaders. Rather than waste taxpayer money for his own personal amusement the president should invest in our veterans and their families. If #PresidentTrump wanted to see our nation\u2019s military might up-close, maybe he shouldn\u2019t have sought five deferments during the Vietnam War, a time when he was busy playing sports like football and tennis. We should not be spending millions of dollars and tearing up our roads just to amuse #POTUS. Just like stock trades or financial assets, members of Congress must report #bitcoins & on their financial disclosure forms under the STOCK Act. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the House Ethics Cmte to issue formal instructions on this matter. The ongoing #flu epidemic is hitting close to home, with an estimated lives already lost in #ROC. Take a moment today and read these guidelines from the on how to recognize the symptoms and prevent the flu in your home: Only during WWII was our debt a higher percentage of gross domestic product than it is right now. I hope this puts to rest once and for all the myth that the Majority is the party of fiscal discipline. #POTUS has called himself the King of Debt. Well, his administration is on track to borrow nearly trillion this year. That\u2019s nearly twice as much as the previous year and due to the #GOPTaxScam for the wealthy and large corporations. The buying & selling of #bitcoins & other are no different, which is why the cmte should issue formal instructions on this matter. The public deserves to know whether federal officials are upholding the public trust & adhering to the highest ethical standards. I wrote this law to protect against insider trading and ensure that federal officials weren\u2019t using their positions of power to pad their own pockets. Today I\u2019m calling on the House Ethics Committee to make it crystal clear that members of Congress are required to report #cryptocurrency assets on their financial disclosure forms under the STOCK Act. I\u2019m proud to have supported the CAA Reform Act, which passed the House today. For too long, members of Congress have been allowed to use taxpayer resources to pay settlements resulting from their awful exploitations of power. This bill is a big step in the right direction. I\u2019m at the Rules Cmte calling out \u2019s short term solution for funding the government since September. Failing to develop a long-term & bipartisan solution that tackles our country\u2019s priorities is shameful and it speaks volumes about the #GOP's inability to govern. I\u2019m so proud to help send off #ROC\u2019s very own Brian Gionta, who will be competing in the as captain of ! I wish him the best of luck, our entire community will be rooting for him. #wintergames This just in! #NY saw another record-breaking year for health care sign ups under the #ACA. This is just more proof that the American people want the quality and comprehensive coverage offered by the #ACA. The democratic memo should be vetted by security agencies & immediately released so the public can get the full picture instead of a one-sided & partisan attack by a dead set on protecting #POTUS. Thanks to the #GOPTaxScam, our nation is expected to hit its debt ceiling earlier than expected. It's outrageous that the party that claimed to care about fiscal responsibility advanced a bill that is catapulting our nation to the edge of a fiscal cliff. The entire country better hope this does not lead to the firing of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which is the intent of releasing this memo, along with trying to stop Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation. The Democratic memo should be immediately released with appropriate redactions to protect national security so the public can get the full picture. The security agencies have been working to figure out what Carter Page was up to long before the campaign or any dossier was ever compiled. ., led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and , just endangered our national security and launched an unprecedented attack on the FBI and the Department of Justice while divulging information to foreign enemies. #MemoDay I recently had the chance to read a book about heroes to a group of fourth grade boys at School in #ROC! We talked about what makes a hero so special and what it takes to make a real difference in your community. The #GreatLakes are home to of all surface fresh water on the planet & good stewardship of this precious resource is a bipartisan issue. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to help this effort. Today kicks of a time to reflect on African Americans\u2019 contributions to our country and ensure that the gains we\u2019ve made in social and economic justice are not lost. This month and always, I will continue to fight exclusion & oppression wherever it exists. The American people deserve to know whether federal officials are upholding the public trust and adhering to the highest ethical standards, or using their powerful positions to enrich themselves. This latest development is just one of many examples of the deep ties to big corporations and significant financial conflicts of interest. As a result of the STOCK Act and the work of a strong press, we know that made several questionable stock trades that posed serious conflicts of interests given her position leading the . Government funding is set to run out in legislative days. Any newly negotiated deal must include a delay in #MedicaidDSH cuts, which protect the ability of safety net hospitals in #NY to continue providing essential health care services to the most vulnerable patients. Last call! Today is the final day for New Yorkers to sign up for comprehensive health care coverage under the #ACA. Go to and enroll before it\u2019s too late! As dean of the delegation, I hosted my Democratic & Republican colleagues from the NY congressional delegation before the #SOTU begins. This is an informal tradition I started years ago and one that I cherish! Decisions like this by #POTUS continue to make one wonder - how far is President Trump willing to go to protect Putin? Just over a year ago, federal intelligence agencies unanimously confirmed that Russia meddled in the Yet, #POTUS still refuses to admit that and instead attacks these very agencies. This move by #POTUS disregards bipartisan legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House & Senate last summer and was signed into law by #POTUS. The president\u2019s ties to Russia are troubling to say the least and are the subject of multiple investigations. Tonight the president will give his #SOTU. Here\u2019s my statement on #whyiwearblack: When #POTUS looks into the gallery during his speech, I want him to see Dustin & the impacts of his broken promises. Got the chance to talk with Dustin Newman from #ROC before we attend the #SOTU. He was recently laid off in a company-wide downsizing even though #POTUS and the #GOP claimed that the #TaxScam would help businesses create jobs. Did you hear the news? Two musicians with #ROC connections took home a #Grammy during last night\u2019s award show! Proud to join more than of my colleagues in demanding #POTUS end the outsourcing of jobs as #NAFTA negotiations continue. We must have a strongly renegotiated #NAFTA that protects American jobs and wages from a race to the bottom.", "This morning, Sally and I met with Secretary Barbara Barrett, Chief of Staff Charles Brown, and Space Force Chief of Operations John Raymond. Each of these individuals embody the best characteristics of our armed forces, and our nation is better for their service. It has been an honor to advocate for our country\u2019s airmen throughout my time in office, and it is their courage and dedication that has kept me going all these years. \u201cOur veterans have never been indifferent. They volunteered, rolled up their sleeves, and helped make a better world. We have all been the beneficiaries. Let\u2019s do more than thank and honor them this year. Let\u2019s all try to be more like them.\" While the courts work their way through legal challenges, this is a time for each American to put the best interests of the nation first. This country is closely divided, and we have to find a way to come together. Supporting our democratic institutions and process is more important than any party, person, or interests. Our national security and military are not bargaining chips. Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have once again pushed partisan legislation, adding unrelated provisions and using political games to prevent necessary funds from reaching our servicemembers and their families. Placing politics over substance guarantees lasting damage to our military and our country as a whole. We need to pass bipartisan legislation that moves the country When it comes to National Defense, there are no Republicans or Democrats, there are only Americans. Whether you are a soldier on a hill in Afghanistan, or on a ship out in the middle of the Pacific, you need to know that the whole country is behind you.

Even in today\u2019s partisan times, I hope we will continue to stand together to support national security and our servicemembers.

It is imperative we get these capabilities back online. The Biden administration has placed the safety of all Americans at risk with their open border policies.

Keep violent criminals behind bars \u2014 NOT out on our streets. Because of soft-on-crime policies like bail reform, a Tennessee police officer lost his life to a criminal who was put back out on the streets. Had he been in jail, this senseless murder would not have occurred. The suspect in the murder of a Memphis police officer was arrested and released without bond in March of this year \u2014 just weeks before the deadly shooting that occurred this morning. This is the result of the Left\u2019s woke soft-on-crime agenda. President Trump made clear that the United States would not hesitate to strike Iran if it perpetuated its campaign of terror and posed a direct threat to the USA and our allies. If Tehran launches an attack on Israel, President Biden should order the military to launch\u2026 I am heartbroken to learn that Memphis Police Officer Joseph McKinney was murdered in the line of duty while protecting and serving Tennesseans.

The migrants arrested for storming the U.S. border and rioting against the National Guard were freely released from jail. Why are we rewarding criminal behavior? What message does this send to the cartels? Gas prices have climbed since January. It\u2019s only April. Bidenflation continues to take its toll on your personal pocketbook. An illegal alien from Guatemala charged with multiple crimes against minors in Massachusetts was arrested & released repeatedly by the courts over the past two years. Why are these criminal illegal aliens being put back onto our streets? Deport criminal illegal aliens. There have been nearly million illegal border crossings under the Biden administration. Americans do NOT want an open border. Nearly migrants were flown into Florida and Texas through the Biden secret migrant flight program. They were granted parole, benefits, and work permits. The government has admitted there are over final destinations. Every state is a border state. Biden\u2019s DHS under Secretary Mayorkas has allowed over million illegals to cross our border and enter our nation. This is disgraceful. Under the Biden administration, illegals are: \u2014 Kicking children out of schools \u2014 Cutting veterans in line for health care \u2014 Squatting in private citizens\u2019 homes is prioritizing illegals above Americans. CBP stopped a smuggler with an strapped to his body at the southern border. Biden\u2019s open border is encouraging violence and chaos. Every town is a border town under Biden. We must build the wall and stop the invasion. If colleges want access to federal funding, they need to abide by immigration law. My Enforcing Rule of Law on Campus Act will ensure our educational institutions play by the rules by withholding federal funding from schools that employ illegal immigrants. Texas is paying the cost of Biden\u2019s border crisis. We must support Texas and finish building the wall. ., you have the power to undo your executive actions that got us here.

He should take accountability for putting countless lives in danger and stand for an impeachment trial in the Senate. Secretary Mayorkas has abused his authority as DHS secretary to open up our border and allow millions of illegals into our nation \u2014 including many who are criminals. For this alone, he should be investigated by the Senate and removed from office. Biden\u2019s open border policies have put Americans at risk of fentanyl poisoning, sex trafficking, and death. SECURE the border. BUILD the wall. We have a constitutional duty to investigate and take seriously the articles of impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas. Chuck Schumer\u2019s partisan attempts to block this process won\u2019t stand.

I don\u2019t think so. Let\u2019s have a trial and let the facts come out. There are two tiers of justice in our nation. One for Democrats and illegals, and another for Republicans and President Trump. . wants to dismiss the impeachment charges against Secretary Mayorkas. Never before has the Senate dismissed impeachment charges without holding a trial. The American people should be enraged. While doing Biden\u2019s bidding, Mayorkas has put thousands of American lives in danger. He should be removed from office. Last year, \u2019s DHS deported less than of all illegals encountered at the border. This is a clear dereliction of duty. RT if you think Secretary Mayorkas should be removed from office for refusing to secure the border. It is unacceptable that our Secretary of Homeland Security is refusing to fulfill his primary duty: Securing the homeland.

The CCP is trying to suppress pro-Israel content. John Kirby today: \u201cWe don't support independence for Taiwan.\u201d The Biden administration is pro-Communist China. The average grocery bill is more expensive today than it was in Consumers are spending more to buy less. Americans cannot afford Bidenomics. Iran and Hezbollah have vowed to punish Israel for defending themselves against terrorism. Eliminate terrorists. Stand with Israel. The rise in violent crime is a direct result of the soft-on-crime policies like cashless bail that are being pushed by woke prosecutors and judges. My bill \u2014 the Keep Violent Criminals Off Our Streets Act \u2014 would keep criminals behind bars and out of our communities.

Woke leaders in CA are bolstering the CCP\u2019s ability to spread communist propaganda in our own backyard.

This includes a: \u2014 billion tax on American energy \u2014 billion retirement tax \u2014 Corporate tax higher than Communist China The American dream is much more difficult under Biden.

Since Biden took office, the average family in Tennessee has had to spend an additional a month to afford the same goods and services as January Tennesseans cannot afford another four years of Biden\u2019s reckless spending.

Protect American communities. Evan has been in jail for simply doing his job as a journalist. Russia should immediately release Wishing all the blessings of a meaningful Good Friday.

I\u2019ve seen what Texas is doing to secure our border for the American people. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is fighting tooth and nail to keep our border wide open.

In Congress, and I introduced the SAFE School Act that would allow public & private schools to train and hire veterans and former law enforcement officers to serve as school safety officers & provide funding to harden schools and increase physical security. I spoke to National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd in Eagle Pass today. His message is clear \u2014 Biden is to blame for this crisis. God bless Texas and the work they are doing to secure our border. In Eagle Pass, TX, I heard from ranchers who have had their homes invaded by illegals aliens and seen horrific acts by smugglers & coyotes.

The consequences of this backtracking for US small businesses & workers globally are unacceptable. We demand answers. My heart goes out to the family members of American troops killed in Jordan. As rogue actors globally test the Biden admin's tolerance for aggression, the U.S. must unequivocally demonstrate our strength and resolve to Iran and all who threaten and take American lives.

Joe Biden has proclaimed Easter Sunday as \u201cTransgender Day of Visibility.\u201d What a coincidence on the timing, right? This is a direct assault on Christianity. Yet another attack on religion and traditions by this administration. I was proud to introduce legislation to eliminate the House Office of Diversity and Inclusion last year. I am pleased to see the office has been eliminated. The House should abide by the same standards we set for federal agencies across the government. Good. Gotta be a cheaper way to make it happen. Today's closure is an absolute blow to our hardworking West Virginia steelworkers & the Weirton community. More than people worked at Weirton Steel years ago. Today, the last workers just lost their jobs. Victims of President Biden & Democrats' Green agenda. When I toured we discussed the threat of unfair foreign competition and how it put the plant at risk. As a result of my meetings, I talked with the Department of Commerce and urged them to crack down on unfair foreign competition and save these jobs. The Department of Commerce sided with us, but the globalist, Democrat led International Trade Commission sided with the cheap foreign competitors and as a result another American plant was closed. I\u2019m proud of WVU\u2019s tenacity this year. Solid season. What a disparity at the line tonight. - WVU Free throw attempts = - Iowa Free throw attempts = Let\u2019s go WVU!!

Thank you to the Division of Forestry personnel and firefighters from around the region working to contain these fires. President Joe Biden\u2019s radical EPA is at it again. Today\u2019s announcement of new tailpipe emission standards is death by regulation for gas-powered cars. West Virginians love to drive and are dependent on gas powered vehicles to navigate our great state. President Biden continues to act as a dictator - forcing an extreme left-wing mandate by executive fiat. I will oppose any effort by the Biden Administration to morph our country into a socialist utopia of overregulation run by nameless bureaucrats in Washington. The ability to live by our religious convictions is inherent to the founding principles of our country. West Virginia House Bill passed by the West Virginia Legislature is a common sense bill that allows private and parochial schools, and those with a religious exemption, to establish their own vaccination policies that align with religious beliefs. The bill also rightfully exempts virtual students who are not physically present in public schools. This legislation balances public health with religious freedom. More spending from Washington = rising inflation. Since Joe Biden took office inflation has risen by Bidenflation is a tax on every American, and it is a direct result of Joe Biden\u2019s out-of-control government spending and #Bidenomics. I am fighting to rein spending in. I oppose giving President Biden sweeping new authority to shut down apps and websites. Biden abuses his power & has weaponized the federal government against conservatives. I stand with President Trump & against giving Biden new powers to shut down free speech. According to , the average WV household has spent more due to inflation since January That's more per month. The Biden big spending agenda is crushing WV families. I will continue stand firm against the out of control spending in DC. Joe Biden took classified materials. Biden was not charged. More taxes. More spending. More debt. I\u2019ve never seen a president mention their predecessor or political opponent more in a speech on the #SOTU. Joe Biden could take extensive action today to secure the border. He refuses. #SOTU Joe Biden is obsessed with Donald Trump. #SOTU Stop talking about and talk about securing our border! #SOTU Joe Biden wants to raise taxes so he can spend more of your hard earned money and fuel inflation. It\u2019s that simple. #SOTU Democrats will spin you all day on the current state out of our economy. People in Buckhannon, Jane Lew, and Weirton know that #Bidenomics is not working. #SOTU Democrats will play up #Obamacare left and right. Anyone that has been to a doctor knows they are paying more than ever. Then months later you receive another bill out of nowhere. #SOTU Biden touting his about his big spending policies that are directly fueling inflation. The national debt clock is spinning so fast these days, I worry jacket will catch fire at any moment. #SOTU This economy is not the envy of anyone in West Virginia. Biden is talking about the power of women when he can\u2019t even define what one is. #SOTU Democrats are perfectly OK with killing babies moments before birth without a second thought. They are at war with life. President Biden loves to focus on fear mongering. Republicans are focused on the facts and getting our country back on track. Hopefully Joe mentions the wide open southern border in the first hour #SOTU President Biden opens his #SOTU by talking about another country. Our country is in a perilous position. Joe Biden\u2019s disastrous policies have created a border crisis, inflation crisis, energy crisis, and a crime crisis. Joe Biden gets a wall for his State of the Union address. Yet our southern border remains wide open. Taxpayers deserve better. House Republicans are committed to doing all that we can to restore order and finish President Trump\u2019s border wall. Once again, Congress is passing a spending plan that was negotiated behind closed doors and fails to hold the Biden Administration accountable. This spending deal increases the bloated Biden spending levels that supercharged inflation. It doesn\u2019t stop the Department of Justice from using your taxpayer dollars to witchhunt President Biden\u2019s political opponents. And it continues to allow taxpayer funded abortions, transgender surgeries at the VA, and mail-order chemical abortions. Legislation being discussed by Congress would give President Biden sweeping power to ban apps on your phone. We should not empower Biden to violate the First Amendment rights of millions of Americans. Biden already abuses his power and thinks he can dictate what we read & think. Biden can shut down the border, but instead he intentionally opened the gates and releases thousands of dangerous criminal illegal immigrants every day. The House has acted to restore President Trump\u2019s successful border policies. The Senate must pass H.R. and restore order. Americans decide who the president is. The radical Colorado Supreme Court overreached. Democracy wins. President Biden going to the border is simply visiting the scene of his crime. I have warned that Congress would continue to kick the can down the road until a massive, bloated funding deal could be reached. And here we are. We should be working around the clock to end President Biden\u2019s dangerous open border policies and weaponization of the DOJ. Any \u201cdeal\u201d to secure our border must not allow millions of illegal immigrants to walk into our country every year. We must: -Finish President Trump\u2019s Border Wall -End -Stop aid to Mexico until they help stop drug smugglers In the radical Obama-Biden Administration shut down coal mining on federal lands as part of their War on Coal. I\u2019m pleased the Ninth Circuit U.S Court of Appeals has overturned the federal moratorium in a victory for American energy producers. Student loan \u201cforgiveness\u201d is nothing more than a redistribution of wealth at the expense of hardworking West Virginians. If you take out a loan, you pay it back. American taxpayers shouldn't have to foot the bill for a billion-dollar student loan bailout. I\u2019m honored to be named the Competitive Markets Legislator of the Year. I am committed to keeping West Virginia family farms in the hands of our hardworking American producers. Keeping our food supply safe from a Communist Chinese takeover is one of the most critical issues facing our country. Heartbreaking news out of Clarksburg this morning. My thoughts and prayers are with the family of Ryan Lantz and the entire Liberty High School community during this difficult time. Happy Presidents\u2019 Day! Dominant victory by tonight! The closure is an absolute blow to our hardworking West Virginia steelworkers. When I toured we discussed the threat of unfair foreign competition and how it put the plant at risk. As a result of my meetings, I talked with the Department of Commerce and urged them to crack down on unfair foreign competition and save these jobs. The Department of Commerce sided with us, but the globalist, Democrat led International Trade Commission sided with the cheap foreign competitors and as a result another American plant was closed. Great to meet with members from across the Second District in DC today. Thanks for all you do to keep West Virginians healthy! The House just voted to impeach Secretary Mayorkas for willfully and systemically refusing to comply with federal immigration laws and breach of the public trust. I voted to impeach him. House Republicans are committed to doing all that we can to restore order. Senator Cruz is spot on. The American people have had enough of the chaos unfolding at our Southern Border. House Republicans understand that. That is why we passed the strongest border security bill in history which Chuck Schumer & Senate Dems have refused to bring to a vote. President Biden \u201cwillfully retained and disclosed classified materials.\u201d Americans expect equal justice under the law. The radicalized DOJ continues to utilize a two-tiered system of justice. One for Republicans and a very different one for \u201celderly\u201d Democrats. Joe Biden and his radical left Administration opened America\u2019s borders and now claim they need a new law to fix the crisis they started. President Biden needs to enforce the current law and crack down on illegal border crossings immediately. Today is National Girls and Women in Sports Day. I am proud to cosponsor the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. No woman should ever be denied an opportunity, scholarship, or a place on the podium because a biological male is competing against them. I voted to impeach Secretary Mayorkas as he has been totally derelict in his duty to enforce the laws passed by Congress to secure our border. Due to his flagrant disregard for the law, America\u2019s border is completely overrun by illegal immigrants. This week I voted to continue President Trump\u2019s pro-family tax policies. I was proud to help pass this bill to make the Child Tax Credit more accessible to working-class families, which will benefit thousands of kids across West Virginia. I\u2019m proud to vote for legislation to remove criminal illegal immigrants from our country. President Biden\u2019s disastrous open border policies are threatening every community. Illegal immigrants who evade Border Patrol and commit crimes should have no right to stay in the U.S. This week, I voted for three pieces of legislation to keep our communities safe: the Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act (H.R the Consequences for Social Security Fraud Act (H.R and the Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act (H.R Clearly it has been some time since President Biden went to the grocery store. Prices have increased percent since the president took office. House Republicans are working to reduce inflation, make everyday life more affordable, and hold the administration accountable.

Astonishingly, House Republicans took this drastic step while refusing to even consider the bipartisan border security bill proposed by Senate negotiators. It\u2019s long past time for Republicans to abandon their harmful political stunts and instead work to advance real solutions to our nation\u2019s challenges. This is an abuse of the solemn power of impeachment which the Constitution reserves for extraordinary circumstances when officials have engaged in serious misconduct. With no evidence of wrongdoing, House Republicans voted to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas today after the House rejected an identical resolution last week. Introduced the Election Day Holiday Act, legislation that will make Election Day a federal holiday. No one should be unable to vote because they have to work or care for a family member. Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy & Congress must make it easier to vote, not harder As we begin let\u2019s recognize the countless contributions Black Americans have made.

As we mourn the loss of seven farmworkers, Congress must finally reverse its inaction on gun violence prevention legislation that could save lives in communities across the country. The deaths of more than people by guns every year is simply unacceptable and a scourge on our society. years ago Roe v. Wade cemented a woman\u2019s constitutional right to choose. The Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision dismantled it, and when they did, for the first time in our history, the Court took a right away. Republicans continue their relentless attacks on women\u2019s rights. Their goal: a national ban on abortions. We must reverse this dangerous path. This afternoon the Half Moon Bay community came together in the most beautiful way to commemorate one of the most tragic days on the coast and the worst mass shooting on our county\u2019s history. We remembered and recommitted to create a better future. Thank goodness ... Congress just averted another damaging government shutdown by passing a bipartisan short-term spending bill that allows us to limp along for an additional days. This stopgap approach does not achieve any of the urgent work Congress needs to get done. We still don\u2019t have a budget. We still don\u2019t have aid for Ukraine, Taiwan, or Israel. We still haven\u2019t addressed the situation at the U.S.- Mexico border. Last year was one of the least productive legislative years in our nation\u2019s history with only bills signed into law \u2026 a total do-nothing Congress. It\u2019s my hope that the Majority won\u2019t repeat their incompetence this year. The American people deserve so much better. All children with cancer should have access to lifesaving treatments. It\u2019s unthinkable that a child would be denied care because of a preventable shortage in our country.

We lost a giant with the passing of Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court. I held her in the highest regard for her intellect, integrity, and grit. She will be remembered for her history-making decisions on abortion, affirmative action, and religion. I will long recall that her first job was in the San Mateo County District Attorney\u2019s Office where I live and have served. I and Members voted to expel Rep. Santos. He has abused the trust of his constituents and has been charged with counts, including wire fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds, and lying to Congress. While he has the right to defend himself in court, his conduct has brought shame to the House and he is unfit to serve. I was deeply touched by the kind words of Chairman Guthrie in our health subcommittee hearing this morning. It reinforces my hope that bipartisanship is possible! We lost a devoted public servant who so loved San Mateo County. Over the last three decades, Don Horsely served the people as Sheriff and a County Supervisor. He leaves behind a legacy of advocating for gun violence prevention, affordable housing and county parks. We will remember him as a champion of youth, improving relations with law enforcement through tutoring, sports and community activities. Don\u2019s humility and joy in serving made him a national treasure. Our country lost a great patriot today. First Lady, Rosalynn Carter, championed mental health during her tenure, and will long be remembered as a true partner to President Carter in the White House and in their decades long marriage. She the Office of the First Lady and went to work daily with her briefcase. As a woman of faith, she was a shining example of decency and goodness. May our prayers for her family be a source of strength to them. It was an honor to join Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi for a breakfast reception with Members of Congress at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco as part of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Today I voted to avert a government shutdown which would require hundreds of thousands of workers to work without pay. While it is shameful that Congress can\u2019t pass a budget, this temporary funding bill will keep the doors open and prevent harmful cuts. For all those who observe, happy #Diwali! May the celebration be filled with light and love. This #VeteransDay I am thrilled that San Mateo County is recognizing veterans who are very dear to me: John Mueller, aka Farmer John, and his father-in-law, Al Adreveno. They are dear friends and local celebrities who contribute so much of themselves to our community. On #VeteransDay and every day I want to thank our veterans for their sacrifices for our country. I will continue to make sure that our veterans receive the services they need and have earned from disability benefits to health care to burial benefits.

The brave soldiers of the WWII Ghost Army are American heroes\u2014but because their mission was top-secret, they never got the recognition they deserved. Last week, Congress changed that and finally awarded these service members the Congressional Gold Medal. As the daughter of a WWII POW, I was proud to lead the legislation that made this possible.

This week and I urged to support New Hampshire\u2019s request to exclude these rebates from income", "If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose \u2013 I promise you I will restore the rights of Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. Right now, families with two cars driving home for the holidays are saving a month on gas compared to mid-June\u2019s peak. Moments ago I spoke to Brittney Griner. She is safe. She is on a plane. She is on her way home. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, if you\u2019re on Medicare and you have diabetes, your cost for insulin will be now be capped at a month. Starting today, my Administration is requiring big internet providers to tell you exactly what you\u2019re paying \u2013 and what you\u2019re getting \u2013 when you purchase your plan. These new labels will be clear and accurate. And they'll stop Americans from getting ripped off. Tune in as I deliver the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress. Today\u2019s jobs report marks another chapter in America\u2019s comeback. With the report of new jobs in March, we've passed the milestone of million jobs created since I took office. That\u2019s million more people who have the dignity and respect that comes with a paycheck. If the prior administration and extreme Republicans in Congress had succeeded in gutting the ACA, million people nationwide would have lost their health insurance. Inhalers cost less than to make. But drug companies charge Americans up to to increase their profits. My Administration has been cracking down on Big Pharma \u2013 and now, three of the four largest inhaler manufacturers are capping out-of-pocket costs at Some Congressional Republicans call the Affordable Connectivity Program wasteful. I call it necessary. It\u2019s time Congress extended it so the million households across America that rely on the program can stay connected. Starting next year, my Inflation Reduction Act will cap total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a year \u2013 even for expensive cancer drugs that can cost a year. Now, I want to cap that cost for every American. In its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote: \u201cWomen are not without electoral or political power.\u201d No kidding. Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women. But they found out. Women make up half of our population but women\u2019s health research has been understudied and underfunded. That\u2019s why I\u2019m signing an Executive Order to ensure women\u2019s health is prioritized across the federal research portfolio and budget. Today\u2019s data shows that wage growth has been the strongest of any economic recovery in years \u2013 and inflation declined two thirds from its peak. I'll continue to fight to lower costs for middle class families and stand in the way of Congressional Republicans who disagree. Congrats, , on bringing home your sixth national title since more than any other team in that time. A college basketball powerhouse with a heart and hard work of a champion \u2013 you\u2019re proof there is nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. I said I wouldn't back down from using every tool at our disposal to get student loan borrowers the relief they need. That's why today we're announcing new plans that, if implemented, would cancel student debt for millions more. A budget that invests in all of America and all Americans. The first image from the Webb Space Telescope represents a historic moment for science and technology. For astronomy and space exploration. And for America and all humanity. Today, my Administration is canceling student debt for more people \u2013 bringing the total number of Americans who have been approved for debt relief so far under my Administration to million through various actions. I will never stop working to cancel student debt. Joining me at my State of the Union is Keenan, a public school educator from Minnesota. He's prepared hundreds of students for college. And because of fixes we made to our Public Student Loan Forgiveness program, he can now afford to send his own daughter to college. We\u2019re delivering for working families \u2014 and we\u2019re only getting started. The United States of America can be defined by one word: possibilities. This week has shown us that there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t get done. From the American Rescue Plan to a infrastructure law. From the most meaningful gun safety and veterans' health care laws in decades to the groundbreaking CHIPS and Science Law and historic Inflation Reduction Act. We're getting the job done. I believe rebuilding the middle class is the moral obligation of our time \u2013 that's why I'm so proud to celebrate Social Security's birthday. It's why me and my Democratic friends on the Hill are working to protect and expand it. Republicans in Congress want it sliced. Today, I sign into law the CHIPS and Science Act. It's a law that invests in America by supercharging our efforts to make semiconductors here at home. Today represents a more secure economy, jobs, and a stronger future for our nation. America is delivering. I remain committed to our monkeypox response: ramping-up vaccine distribution, expanding testing, and educating at-risk communities. That's why today's public health emergency declaration on the virus is critical to confronting this outbreak with the urgency it warrants. The current drop in gas prices continues to be the fastest decline in over a decade. cents down and counting since mid-June. Everyone over should get a booster shot. And if you're above you should get two \u2013 I did. After being boosted, your odds of getting severely ill from COVID are very, very low. How many more mass shootings do we need to see where the shooter is and able to get their hands on a weapon to go on a killing spree? The Safer Communities Act requires young people under to undergo enhanced background checks before purchasing a gun. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act closes the \"boyfriend loophole.\" If you're convicted of an assault against your partner, you can't buy or own a gun. Period. Gas prices have been dropping for days straight, about cents a gallon. That saves the average driver about a month. I know those extra dollars and cents mean something. It's breathing room. And we're not done working to get prices even lower. Because of the progress we've made over the past months, isn\u2019t controlling people\u2019s lives like it did in the past. But as I\u2019ve said: we must remain vigilant. We\u2019re ready to take on and we have the strategy we need to protect Americans. Today I signed an Executive Order to protect the reproductive rights of women in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It formalizes the actions I announced right after the decision and will add new measures to protect women's health. Folks, the United States just became the first country in the world to offer safe and effective vaccines for kids as young as six months old. Set your reminders, folks. Join me tonight at PM ET for my State of the Union. You can watch on Instagram, Facebook, right here on X, or at Fifty-one years ago in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court recognized a woman\u2019s right to make personal health care decisions. In the Supreme Court took it away. Today and always, and I stand for women\u2019s reproductive freedom and call on Congress to restore Roe for good. Today, I spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu to emphasize that strikes on aid workers and the humanitarian situation in Gaza are unacceptable. Israel must implement steps to address civilian harm and the safety of workers \u2013 and work toward a ceasefire to bring hostages home. This morning, I convened senior members of my team for a briefing on the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge. I've directed my Administration to ensure every federal resource is available to assist search and rescue efforts and response to this terrible incident. PFAS are chemicals found in our water, soil, air, and food. They're dangerous, and my Administration is addressing them. The is issuing the first-ever national standard to address PFAS and delivering billion from my agenda to help states detect and treat this pollutant. With this week's announcement, we\u2019re on course to relieve student debt for over million Americans. See if you're in one of the groups these new plans would impact: The American Rescue Plan allowed our nation to turn setback into comeback. Folks call Bettie Mae the Voice of Selma. She sings songs of prayer and protest. One of them \u2013 \u201cThis Little Light of Mine\u201d \u2013 shined through the darkness on that bridge that Bloody Sunday. I'm honored she joined the First Lady as a guest for my State of the Union tonight. You may\u2019ve heard I\u2019ve got a big speech coming up. So, I thought I would hear from some folks who have done the job before \u2013 sort of. Our higher education system should provide Americans with opportunity \u2013 not burdens of loan debt. Today, my Administration approved debt cancellation for more borrowers, bringing the total of Americans whose debt has been cancelled through various actions to million. Three years ago, a violent mob fueled by lies attacked the U.S. Capitol. Our democracy was tested. But it held because We the People prevailed. It's up to us to prove \u2013 for all its imperfections \u2013 American democracy is still a beacon to the world and a promise to be kept. In memory of Nex, we must all recommit to our work to end discrimination and address the suicide crisis impacting too many nonbinary and transgender children. My Administration is cancelling student loans for an additional public service workers \u2013 teachers, nurses, and more \u2013 via Public Service Loan Forgiveness. public service workers have now had their debt cancelled. And we won't back down from delivering more relief. is now live thanks to my Inflation Reduction Act. This new tool will provide millions of Americans with an option to file their taxes for free. Head over to the site today to see if you are eligible. Special interests are suing \u2013 the folks responsible for protecting consumers \u2013 for their new rule that will lower credit card late fees from to Credit card giants have overcharged Americans for too long. It's time they get reined in.", "This is a flagrantly partisan, rushed review that will only serve to advance the Biden radical political agenda. My Capital Markets subcommittee held a hearing in January on the Biden Fiduciary Rule where we heard from experts on how harmful this rule will be to retail investors and how it threatens to shut out millions of Americans from a safe and secure retirement. Main Street investors in Missouri and around the country are relying on us to make it easier for them to save for retirement, not harder, and I will continue fighting the Biden burdensome, totally misguided, and rushed rulemaking. Though this was removed from the final rule, I have serious concerns regarding the future of Scope disclosures, & I questioned our witnesses on what the SEC could have done differently to ensure businesses aren\u2019t overly burdened by such disclosures. The held a hearing on the SEC Climate Rule. This rule initially included Scope greenhouse gas emissions data, which would have forced MO farmers to track all emissions being produced by their crop & livestock\u2014an extremely time consuming and costly task. I had the opportunity to help cut the ribbon on the new VA Whole Health Wellness Center at Jefferson Barracks. The new Whole Health approach is helping our veterans handle stress, manage pain, and live a healthier lifestyle. Thank you to Medical Director Candace Ifabiyi and Chief of Staff Dr. Christopher Prevel for showing me around and telling me all about their commitment to our veterans. Joe Biden is about to abandon Israel the same way he abandoned Afghanistan. He is caving to the Hamas sympathizers who have taken over the Democratic party and given up our strongest ally in the Middle East. His announcement could destabilize the region and embolden Iran, and it is just more proof of his weakness on the world stage. Thank you to Akif, Damir, and Alija, leaders in our local Bosnian community, for having me out at Berix in South County. I appreciated the opportunity to talk about how the federal government can be responsive to their needs here in St. Louis. We also discussed my Dayton Peace Accords legislation and how important it is the Treasury Department sanctioned supporters of Milorad Dodik, sanctions that follow the lead of my legislation. Thanks to Tyler King & Downtown Washington for a small business tour of downtown Washington. It was wonderful to meet w/ our local small business owners to talk about the importance of their businesses in Washington, & the need to support economic development so they can thrive. Enjoyed visiting The Alley to see the different entertainment for all ages, Swallows Nest for an amazing lunch, & Wanderlust Market for snacks for the road. Kim\u2019s Candy Dish had an incredible variety of candy & sweets, & we had a great time at Bootleggers Cigars & Apothecary. I enjoyed touring Compass Health Network\u2019s Union facility and learning about the broad range of services they provide across Missouri counties. I met w/ the Missouri Society of CPAs & had an informative discussion about how technology has transformed the industry. We talked about the importance of giving students the opportunity to learn more about accounting at a younger age to foster greater interest in the profession. He is Risen! Ray and I hope you and your loved ones have a Happy Easter. Thank you to the Missouri Corn Growers for visiting with us in Washington. We had a great meeting where we discussed the importance of corn growers and farmers in Missouri working hard to keep our local families well-fed. The Corn Growers are also powering the future of next generation energy that can be produced right here in Missouri. In our quest to make our nation energy independent, it is great to see Missouri farmers doing their part to achieve that goal. I appreciated meeting with State Representative Brad Christ and his wife Erin last week before my office gave them a tour of the U.S. Capitol. The Gallagher family from Fenton met w/ me as part of the National Down Syndrome Society Advocacy Conference. We are deeply inspired by their commitment and passion, and I look forward to working w/ them & supporting legislation to help empower individuals with Down Syndrome. It is absolutely unconscionable the Biden Administration is abandoning our strongest ally in the Middle East like this. A ceasefire would only help Hamas and does not bring us one second closer to an end to this war. The Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing where we questioned General Mark Milley, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Kenneth McKenzie, former Commander of U.S. Central Command, on the Biden reckless withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Administration ignored the advice of allies, experts, and military leaders\u2014blowing past warning sign after warning sign as it allowed Afghanistan to collapse. Tragically, one of the lost at the bombing at Abbey Gate was from my home state of Missouri, Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz. The betrayal of Afghanistan & subsequent chaotic, shameful withdrawal seriously damaged our credibility as an ally and leader. The House must immediately take up the Radiation Exposure Compensation Reauthorization Act. Missourians are terrified radioactive waste is poisoning our communities. Innocent victims of the U.S. nuclear weapons program are relying on Congress for help. Watch my speech here. I am heading down to the Floor to urge House leadership to schedule a vote on the reauthorization and expansion of RECA as soon as possible. Tune in. RELEASE: Wagner Statement on Appropriations Package The reauthorization and expansion of RECA is vital for affected Americans here in St. Louis and around the country. I am extremely disappointed Senate and House leadership failed to include the Senate-passed RECA in the appropriations package released today. Time is of the essence, and I will continue to fight for any path forward to get this passed in the House. The SEC\u2019s burdensome regulatory approach reveals the urgent need for sensible reforms at an agency responsible for protecting investors and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Watch my opening statement here. RELEASE: House Passes Wagner Dayton Peace Agreement Legislation Read more here As a guarantor of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the U.S. must use its economic toolkit to deter corruption, obstructionism, & secessionism in Bosnia & promote its integration w/ the West. My bill, the Upholding the Dayton Peace Agreement Through Sanctions Act, does just this. As the Vice Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and as Representative of the largest Bosnian community outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I know what the consequences will be if we fail to stand strong against destructive politicians who seek to undo years of peace. Watch my speech urging my colleagues to support my legislation here. Despite the rain and storms, I hope everyone is having great and safe #STL RELEASE: Wagner Leads House Colleagues in Calling for RECA Reauthorization to be Included in Upcoming Appropriations Legislation Read the full letter here I have championed legislation in the House to uphold the Dayton Peace Agreement through the use of sanctions, so I am extremely pleased to see that Treasury sanctioned three individuals for supporting Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik and his attempts... ...to undo the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I appreciate the Administration for following my lead as we work to maintain peace in the region, and know the tens of thousands of Bosnians in the St. Louis region support these sanctions as well. I have been fighting for legislation to protect Americans from the dangers of TikTok and to keep your private data secure from the Chinese Communist Party for more than a year now. The House today voted overwhelmingly to ban applications that are controlled by a foreign adversary, like Russia, China, and Iran. Apps controlled by our enemies can harvest your personal information and pose a serious national security threat. It is long overdue to act against China\u2019s digital espionage and this bill will serve as a necessary bulwark to ensure our national security remains strong. Democrats will go to any lengths to hold onto power, including counting illegal migrants in the U.S. Census. Let me be clear - only American citizens should be counted when determining electoral votes or full stop. This is just another way for liberals to take electoral power from Missouri citizens and incentivize more illegal immigration across our already wide-open border. I signed on to legislation this week to put a stop to this abuse of power. Thank you and for leading on this and stopping this abuse of power. I met with the Commander of the St. Louis Army Corps of Engineers to get an update on their projects and how they are engaging with local communities in the St. Louis region. In addition to supporting our flood control infrastructure, they have an incredible Veterans Curation Program that helps veterans get employment and job training. RELEASE: Wagner Applauds Passage of Capital Markets Legislation Read here RELEASE: Wagner, Colleagues Call on Speaker Johnson to Include RECA Reauthorization in Upcoming Appropriations Package Read more here I had the opportunity last week to speak with members of the Edward Jones grassroots fly-in in Washington. This is a great event every year not only because Edward Jones is headquartered in my hometown of St. Louis... ...but also because Edward Jones advisors serve over of my constituents. As Chair of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, I spoke on the work we have accomplished this past year advancing commonsense reforms... ...that recognize the vibrancy of financial centers in America\u2019s heartland, including supporting capital formation and retail investors, and easing regulatory burdens for small businesses. Thank you to Major General Levon Cumpton of the Missouri National Guard for briefing me on the Guard\u2019s recent deployments to the Southern Border, as well as its important missions in the Middle East. Major General Cumpton commands over Soldiers, Airmen, and state and federal employees, and I appreciated his insight on ongoing operational issues. Time is of the essence, & I\u2019m fighting for RECA\u2019s inclusion in the next Congressional funding bill that must be passed by March Asking my MO House colleagues to join me in this effort to House & Senate Leadership & the Appropriations Committees to help victims of our WWII nuclear programs in the STL/St. Chas areas. Let me be clear, I will do all that I can to see RECA signed into law. I have consistently fought on this issue for the last decade and those who stood alongside me know the work I have done to support our St. Louis community. ... \u201cTo serve a cause greater than oneself through a strong and effective leadership that consistently applies common sense conservative principles, confronts injustice and serves as a voice for the most vulnerable in our society.\u201d This vision statement guides me each day in what I do as your representative for the Second District, and fighting for proper compensation for victims of the United States WWII nuclear program is yet another way to help those in need. I will work with my Missouri colleagues to move this program to the floor for a vote as fast as possible before the program expires this summer. I am proud to hang a mission statement in my office that reads in part... RELEASE: Wagner Slams Out of Touch State of the Union Address Read the full release here I am pleased to announce my amendment to the Expanding Access to Capital Act was agreed to by the House. My provision removes an arbitrary SEC staff position & allows investment professionals to determine which investments a closed-end fund should make. This would increase investment opportunities for millions of Americans and eliminate unnecessary barriers restricting investor access. Watch my speech urging my colleagues to support this amendment here. Appreciated meeting with Tim Tebow and discussing my Child Online Safety Modernization Act, legislation that requires online platforms to report the sex trafficking of children. I am grateful he is in Washington this week to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee on the proliferation of child sexual abuse material and what we can do to better protect children and rescue victims of this horrific crime. I went live on the air with Mark Reardon for Fish Fry Fridays at Incarnate Word in Chesterfield. This is such a wonderful event for our community to come together, and I was able to give an update on the latest news from Washington\u2026 \u2026including what we have been doing to secure our border, prevent fentanyl overdoses, and make sure Congress is working for you. Today is Independence Day for Bosnia and Herzegovina and I hope all our friends celebrating had a wonderful day. Our Bosnian community here in St. Louis has been great to work with as we strengthen the ties between our two nations. Our delegation met with Volodymr Zelensky, the President of Ukraine, and our conversation only reaffirmed my commitment to supporting Ukraine in this absolutely unjust war. Hearing the stories of the brave Ukrainians fighting for the freedom of their families... ...and their fellow countrymen and women was a searing reminder of the brutality of Vladimir Putin and the strength of the Ukrainian people. Congress must pass a comprehensive national security package that addresses support for Ukraine as well as our own domestic security. I met with the Ministers of Defense and Foreign Affairs for the Netherlands and had a productive conversation about the growing strength of NATO and our commitment to countering Russia\u2019s aggression and sharing the burden of supporting Ukraine. I am gratified that so many of our NATO allies are making immense sacrifices to meet (and even exceed) their of GDP defense spending target well ahead of schedule. We also held a women legislators\u2019 event where we examined each of our nations\u2019 role in repelling the evil of Vladimir Putin\u2019s reckless and indiscriminate war. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands is poised to become the next head of NATO, and hearing their insights was especially instructive as we look ahead to working with him. I met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and underscored the importance of energy security and the role U.S. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has in countering Russia\u2019s influence. The Biden recent arbitrary and indefinite pause on U.S. LNG exports is a ... ...slap in the face to our allies, who are relying on the U.S. to help them end their dependence on Russian energy. I pressed Chancellor Scholz to transfer Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine\u2014weapons that can make a real difference on the battlefield & help Ukraine win. I spoke to the Missouri Farm Bureau and gave a Congressional update on what we are doing to fight back against Joe Biden\u2019s climate policies that are hurting farmers here in Missouri. The government needs to get out of the way so our farmers can grow the food our communities rely on to feed their kids and loved ones. As part of my work on the United States Delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I recently had meetings with European leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany and our NATO Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Belgium. I serve as the Vice Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and I know how crucial our partnership with NATO allies is to maintaining global stability and a strong national security here at home. Thank you to our Republican Caucus in the State House for having me in to give a legislative update about what we are doing in Congress. I appreciated highlighting some of my recent work, including my questioning of Treasury Secretary Yellen on\u2026 \u2026the government\u2019s attempts to search your private financial records and our ongoing efforts to secure the border from the influx of illegal migrants and fentanyl into our neighborhoods. Many women need IVF to step into one of the most precious roles a woman can fulfill, being a mother. The love they have for the innocent life they brought into this world is unmatched, and IVF helps so many women experience the miracle of motherhood. I am a strong supporter of IVF efforts for Missouri women, and I do not support any efforts to ban IVF and close women off from their dream of having a family. I was extremely sad to hear of the passing of Marilyn Fox. She was a true giant in St. Louis and was fully invested in supporting charitable organizations and helping those in need in our community. Marilyn cared deeply for those around her, and she has left a legacy that will impact generations to come. I am incredibly grateful to have worked closely with her while I was Ambassador to Luxembourg and her husband, Sam, was Ambassador to Belgium. I was blessed to count her as a friend, and I know her leadership and life of service will inspire many others to step up and serve their community. I am praying for her friends, her family, and all others close to her. I appreciated meeting with constituents Erin and Sofia who were in Washington advocating for increased funding for childhood cancer programs on behalf of Erin\u2019s younger sister. Hearing personal stories like theirs is important as we work through the legislative process, and getting involved as college students is incredibly admirable. The murder of Alexei Navalny is a desperate attempt by Vladimir Putin to stop his dictatorship from crumbling around him. The world has seen the weakness of Russia\u2019s government and military and Putin knows his grasp over Russia is weakening by the day. I spoke w/ Navalny\u2019s widow, Yulia, in Munich this week. She is ready to continue her husband\u2019s work & fight for all those who wish to see the brutality of Putin & his cronies come to an end. God bless her & all those fighting against Vladimir Putin and for freedom and democracy.", "Today, will sign my Emmett Till into law. For the first time in U.S. history, we are finally make lynching a FEDERAL hate crime. And we are doing it in Emmett Till\u2019s name. It\u2019s time to right this historic injustice. Wishing everyone in IL's First District & around the country a I am thrilled that the House & Senate passed S. the Senate version of my bill to ban charging families exorbitant costs to call incarcerated loved ones. This is inhumane & immoral, which is why I have been working with advocates for years to stop it. This practice serves only to fatten profits & harm families, and once signs the bill, we will put a stop to it. Thank you to for partnering with me on this vital issue, & for working to get this bill across the finish line. The bill is named after a woman who became an activist on the issue after she was forced to choose between paying for her medication & talking to her incarcerated grandson over the phone, due to the exorbitant prison phone charges. Chain grocery stores may leave underserved neighborhoods, but we can survive without them. Decreasing our dependence on corporate benevolence can increase our self-reliance if we invest in community food co-ops. The opportunity is here. Wishing the Jewish community in IL\u2019s First District & across the country a #HappyHanukkah. I hope your celebrations are filled with joy, peace & happiness. Wednesday, & I hosted a roundtable regarding the failing water infrastructure in the South Suburbs attended by Southland mayors & officials from the & IEPA. Federal & State resources are needed to provide these communities w/ a reliable supply of clean water. As a former railroad worker myself, I am deeply concerned for railroad employees. That\u2019s why I voted for both of \u2019s bills that would keep the country\u2019s rail lines running & grant workers the personal time off they deserve. I urge the Senate to pass both bills. I am saddened by the death of my friend, colleague, & fellow Energy & Commerce Committee member, Representative Donald McEachin. We shared a passion for promoting racial & gender equality, as well as environmental justice. We also shared a calling as ministers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. My heartfelt condolences are extended to Donald\u2019s family. It is totally unacceptable that Southland suburban families have been repeatedly left w/out water, especially during Thanksgiving. This is a serious issue, & I have arranged a roundtable meeting w/ senior & IL EPA officials to address the problem. I wish everyone in IL\u2019s First District & across the country a Happy Thanksgiving \u2014 a time to spend with family & loved ones while we reflect on what we are most grateful for in our lives. Wishing a very Happy Birthday! Thank you for bringing respect & dignity back to the Oval Office. You lead with compassion for all Americans.

This week, the released a troubling report showing that deaths in the US are preventable, which stresses the urgency to address the issue. America already faces a higher maternal mortality rate than other high-income Melanie\u2019s story inspired me to introduce legislation (that passed in addressing postpartum depression as a national priority & funding research. Courageous women, including & , shared their experiences & helped champion this effort in Congress. Progress is possible. We must bring attention to disparities & advance women\u2019s health care for everyone. There is no reason why mothers should be dying in America from preventable conditions, especially when warning signs are ignored. We owe it to mothers & their families. I am proud to cast my vote to reform the Electoral Count Act of that upholds the American electoral process. The January insurrection was a repugnant attack on our nation\u2019s democracy, & we must prevent future attempts to illegally overturn elections.

We must #EndTheStigma of seeking help, especially as the reports that suicides in the Black community have risen. Today marks the beginning of which celebrates the contributions & achievements of Hispanic Americans. The Latino community has a long history of strengthening IL\u2019s District & helped made Chicago the city it is today. Thank you, & , for making sure rail workers receive a fair deal. Now & freight trains that Chicagoland depends on can keep running this weekend. technology must be standard in every Illinois home \u2014 allowing us to save money & fight climate change all at once. That's why I made sure that the will make efficient appliances more attainable for working-class families. J. Edgar Hoover's FBI harassed Americans who challenged the status quo\u2014unfairly targeting notable figures like Aretha Franklin & lesser-known people making a difference. I introduced the COINTELPRO Full Disclosure Act to expose this abuse of power. On the anniversary of the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, I affirm my commitment to stand against gender-based violence, especially as Black women face a homicide rate three times higher than white women. #VAWA If you or someone you know is a victim of domestic violence, please do not hesitate to reach out for help. Call at or text \"START\" to Most of us will never forget where we were on \u2014 a day filled with shock & horror. Today, on the anniversary, we honor the lives lost & incredible heroism of the first responders & passengers on Flight On Gun Violence Prevention Day of Action, I reaffirm my commitment to Guns put our communities, families, & children in danger. That\u2019s why promote comprehensive #GunSafety legislation to in every aspect of American life. I stand with the people of Chicago in welcoming the migrants to our great city. I will be working with the Chicago Congressional Delegation to remedy the situation. It is cruel and inhumane for Governor Greg Abbott to force vulnerable people \u2014 including small children and pregnant women \u2014 to travel a thousand miles, all to score political points and promote his presidential ambitions. I stand with the people of Chicago in welcoming the migrants to our great city. I will be working with the Chicago Congressional Delegation to remedy the situation. This mistreatment mirrors the way immigrant and migrant populations have been treated in recent years, chiefly Haitians, which reflects poorly on our nation. Everyone deserves our neighborly love and respect. Families are currently charged incredibly high fees to talk to loved ones in jail or prison. That\u2019s inhumane & immoral. I introduced the Martha Wright Prison #PhoneJustice Act to end this exploitive practice. This work led to the Federal Communications Commission lowering costs, but the FCC currently only has oversight on calls crossing state lines. My bill would allow them to regulate all prison & jail phone calls, while also capping costs. years ago, a child named #EmmettTill was tortured & murdered by white supremacists. His brutal murder & his mother\u2019s determination to show the world what had happened to her son marked a turning point in the civil rights movement. I was proud that my Emmett Till Antilynching Act was signed by , but this anniversary is a stark reminder that the work for racial justice is ongoing & far from over. Today announced that the White House is making student loan debt more affordable and bearable \u2014 fantastic It\u2019s hard to show the full picture of how #GunViolence shatters families & communities. reports about the devastating impact of shootings, as too many kids witness a parent\u2019s murder. This is why we are fighting to Thank you, & , for covering my career as I prepare to leave DC. As a Black Panther, an Alderman, & a Congressman, my mission never changed. I sought to improve the lives of my neighbors, the disadvantaged, & the Black community. The is a historic investment in clean energy & our climate. A newly released federal study states that by IRA will reduce America's carbon emissions by further stressing the importance of implementing this law. J. Edgar Hoover waged a career-long assault on civil liberties, & through COINTELPRO, he targeted Americans who challenged the status quo. I introduced the COINTELPRO Full Disclosure Act to shine a light on this history & strip his name off the FBI HQ. Hoover famously harassed Martin Luther King Jr. for his work promoting civil rights, but he also used COINTELPRO to spy on groups advocating for women\u2019s rights, worker\u2019s rights, Native-American rights, & other causes seeking societal change in an unjust world. Hoover\u2019s criminal behavior is a stain on our nation\u2019s history. He abused the U.S. Constitution & does not deserve having his name on a federal building, especially one dedicated to the pursuit of justice. We must know the full scope of his misconduct. I am glad to see sign the today that will improve the lives my constituents & American families already struggling to survive on modest incomes. IRA will lower kitchen-table costs, make a historic climate investment, & reduce the national debt. The includes a key provision that I fought for: to clean up air pollution near public schools, guaranteeing children the right to breathe clean air. Looking forward to seeing sign the IRA today. Proud of what the achieved this Congress. From passing the to #GunSafety reform, creating an #AntiLynching law, upgrading America\u2019s infrastructure, & improving the postal service, Dems are working hard to improve the lives of all Americans. Proud to have voted for the today. Congress passed this historic piece of legislation to ease the burdens facing American families, improve our economic stability, & strengthen our fight against climate change. Looking forward to seeing sign it. Everything from our cars, phones, microwaves, & TVs need semiconductors to function. Now after signed the Act into law today, more semiconductor chips will not only be made in America, but made in IL! America has a long history of racially motivated violence, w/ #AhmaudArbery\u2019s murder being a clear example of a modern-day lynching. Although justice was served here, we must remember that too many other acts of vigilante racism are unseen & ignored. Voting is one of our most sacred rights as citizens & gives us the power to shape our communities for generations. On the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, let\u2019s push to #RestoreTheVRA & end voter suppression. True democracy does not discriminate. Relieved to hear that the has made arrests & filed charges in death, but make no mistake \u2014 justice has not yet been served. There must be consequences for such gross misconduct, & similar tragedies cannot be repeated. My heart goes out to the family of & the families of the staffers whose lives were lost in a car accident today. Their deaths are a tragedy & a loss for all of us in the House. I will be praying for them. Although it is a shame that it took them tries to get it over the finish line, I am relieved that the Senate finally put by passing the #PACTAct last night. Once signed into law, this bill will expand health care & benefits to all toxic-exposed veterans. I joined , & others today for the grand opening of Card\u2019s new customer care center in Chatham. This new facility will bring jobs to IL\u2019s District & help revitalize the Chatham community. Words cannot describe 's impact on the & the Black community. He was a champion on & off the court, breaking barriers in records & by becoming the Black coach in professional sports. We should strive to emulate his integrity, character, & determination. #GunViolence takes a horrific toll on our neighborhoods, schools, & families. It is irresponsible for Congress to accept the status quo & not advance more commonsense #GunSafety legislation. Today, I stood w/ to by voting for H.R. Honored to join @ today\u2019s Act enrollment ceremony hosted by . This bill will bring high paying semiconductor manufacturing jobs to IL & help diversify the #STEM field. Now it moves to \u2019 desk!

Thrilled to attend the grand opening today of national lab\u2019s new upgrade w/ & . The addition will keep the lab & IL @ the forefront of global x-ray science. Today marks what would have been Emmett Till\u2019s birthday. Murdered at his death sparked a nationwide protest for the safety & protection of Black lives \u2013 galvanizing the civil rights movement. Emmett Till\u2019s legacy was forged by his mother\u2019s persistent fight for justice, which pushed the U.S. to broadening civil liberties. That is why we introduced H.R. the Emmett Till & Mamie Till-Mobley Congressional Gold Medal Act, to acknowledge her fight for civil rights. Proud to cast my vote for the House minibus spending package, which would fund the creation of good-paying jobs, bolster our economy, & strengthen our fight against climate change. I am also thrilled that critical investments have been included to enrich the District. On #MandelaDay, we honor Nelson Mandela's legacy. Many of the most inspirational & empowering moments in my life were shared w/ him. The times that I was in company, I heard his impeccable words of wisdom flowing from his great reservoir of integrity, morality, & social justice. Suicides shatter families & communities, which is why mental health resources are crucial. Tomorrow, those in need can call which will connect them directly to the national suicide & crisis prevention hotline w/ trained crisis counselors. The GOP wants to put women\u2019s bodies under state control. We cannot let them punish women for making their own choices. That is why I voted for the Women's Health Protection Act. #WHPA Serving as the Bard Prison Initiative\u2019s commencement speaker was a great honor. Education gives us higher purpose & by educating the incarcerated, Bard allows its students to determine their own lives. I am moved by & its graduates. I am firm believer in giving people chances. That is why I have been a major supporter of the Bard Prison Initiative, which offers college education to incarcerated people. In June, I was honored by to be their commencement speaker & a honorary degree recipient. Tonight, I will vote for The Active Shooter Alert Act to give local law enforcement access to technology to send out AMBER Alert-like messages during situations. This vital resource will help keep communities safe. Today, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune\u2019s statue was unveiled in the U.S. Capitol\u2019s Statuary Hall. She was an educator, civil rights activist, & presidential advisor. Her statue is a welcomed addition to the Capitol, as it tells an important story in our nation\u2019s history. After every hearing, Trump\u2019s role in the insurrection becomes more clear to the American public. I am horrified by the actions of not only those extremist groups but of our former president. Advancements in technology allow for historic moments. NASA's Webb telescope allows us to see the deepest parts of space that was once unknown. Thank you to every astronomer, scientist, & engineer at who made this possible. Today, I proudly attended the \u2019s celebration of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. I was honored to vote for this historic legislative package, but our work addressing is not over. Stronger #GunSafety laws are needed to save lives. During my time in Congress, I have worked to address the racial disparities in the health care system. This & I reaffirm our commitment to breaking systemic barriers that Black & Brown Americans face w/ mental health care. Honored to participate in the ribbon cutting at Friend Health Center in #Woodlawn today w/ & community leaders. This new health center is set to serve thousands of South-Side families, in areas that include dental, pediatric, mental & women\u2019s health care. Thrilled that jobs were created in June, continuing the monumental job growth under Biden. Americans still feel the pandemic's financial strain, but we are on the path to recovery. More work to be done, & are finding ways to lower costs for American families Wishing everyone in the District & across the country a Happy of July! Yesterday, I was thrilled to tour the chocolate academy in celebration of Thank you , for recognizing our long partnership in supporting Chicago businesses & employees. Today\u2019s ruling undermines our ability to fight the climate crisis & threatens Congress\u2019 ability to respond to any major crisis in the future. advancement is clearly in peril under this Trumpian, runaway Supreme I am moved by the historic nature of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s swearing in, as she has broken a glass ceiling & inspired Black girls to pursue & achieve whatever they set their minds to. I\u2019m filled with hope thinking of what barriers are now broken. An uncomfortable truth is that #GunViolence collides with so many different aspects of American life & can affect anyone. W/out stronger gun laws, we are vulnerable in our schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, & even in our homes. Chicago blues icon #MuddyWaters is known as of the founding fathers of Rock & Roll. His song \u201cRollin' Stone\u201d inspired both the name of the rock band & the magazine. He was inducted into the & won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The reports that as of end of May more than students have been exposed to #GunViolence since the #Columbine shooting in Stronger laws are needed to protect our children. Last Friday night, I had the great honor of attending the annual banquet where I was presented with the J. Ernest Wilkinson Award & saw my former intern, Natasha Jenkins, installed as the CCBA\u2019s new president. Congrats, Natasha! \u201cQueen of the Blues\u201d Dinah Washington was a Grammy winner known for her vocal control & phrasing, inspired by her time singing in a south-side Chicago church. Washington was inducted into the in Gun trafficking has devastated Chicago, as criminals duck IL\u2019s #GunSafety laws & bring in firearms from adjacent states to commit crimes. I applaud the passage of the as it incorporated language of my bill to ban #GunTrafficking & By striking down #Roe, SCOTUS has turned back the clock on women\u2019s rights by denying them autonomy over their own bodies. This decision currently hurts poor, rural, & disadvantaged women in conservative states the most, but it has the potential to affect every woman in this country as it opens the door for a future GOP-controlled Congress to pass a national ban. If the conservative pro-life movement really cared about the lives of children, they would be supporting mothers & children instead of prohibiting healthcare access & oppressing women. The #SouthSide\u2019s is of the most Grammy nominated artist in history. He\u2019s not only an artist, but a music & TV producer, who produced album Thriller & the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. He\u2019s been inducted into the Mental health resources have always been important for college students, but campus counseling centers have seen a increase in demand. Today, I voted for the Enhancing Mental Health & Suicide Prevention Through Campus Planning Act to better support students. Although IL has strong gun safety laws, guns are brought in from other states w/looser regulations. That\u2019s why I introduced the Gun Trafficking Prohibition Act, to ban gun trafficking & straw purchasing. The #GunTrafficking Prohibition Act would also create a federal crime to transfer a gun across state lines knowing it will be used in a violent crime or drug offense. I sponsored this bill times, originally naming it after who was killed w/ a trafficked gun. Last night, I voted for H.R. the bipartisan Restoring Hope for Mental Health & Well-Being Act, which passed the House. Mental health is a serious issue & we need to provide resources & support to the millions of Americans struggling w/mental health & substance abuse crises. #Englewood\u2019s Jennifer Hudson became a household name after competing on American Idol & starring in Dreamgirls. Hudson is the person & Black woman to join the #EGOT club, meaning she has won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, & a Tony. cc: It was a great holiday weekend, as I was invited to speak yesterday at both the Juneteenth Peace Rally @ #KenwoodAcademy & the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus\u2019 Juneteenth Soir\u00e9e, where I received that Alderman #OscarDePriest Lifetime Achievement Award. Last week, I asked to investigate the white nationalists arrested in Idaho under the Anti-Riot Act, as the group's intent to riot a Pride event deserves to be taken more seriously than a state-level misdemeanor. With \u2019s signature, the Emmett Till is now law!! We have FINALLY made lynching a federal crime in America. I am elated.", "Republicans want you to forget that they voted against the Child Tax Credit and gave the wealthiest corporations a Trillion tax break. Don\u2019t. million clean energy jobs environmental justice jobs clean transportation jobs natural infrastructure jobs construction jobs clean manufacturing jobs The builds a better future for working families and our planet. Under the #ACA, being a woman is no longer a preexisting condition. Breast cancer screenings, birth control, and maternity care are treated like the primary preventative health care that they are. That is the difference between Democratic leadership and Republican extremism. Walking into #Homestead Detention Facility with Speaker Johnson and the want to take women back in time and seize compete control of their reproductive lives. This I\u2019m fighting to end the MAGA march toward a nationwide abortion ban and secure equality for every woman everywhere. It\u2019s not about children. It\u2019s not about families. The Republican war on women and reproductive freedom boils down to just one thing: control. Banning assault weapons will save lives. We can't wait. Inflation Reduction Act: Signed. Sealed. Delivered. For the People. Lower energy costs. Lower prescription drug prices. Lower health insurance premiums. Lower carbon emissions. Lower inflation. Progress for the people. Last night the people of Kansas rejected the MAGA Republicans\u2019 extreme agenda to criminalize abortion and health care. Their vote sends a clear message in our fight for reproductive freedom: our bodies over politics. days ago, signed the American Rescue Plan into law providing million Americans free and affordable health care. For Democrats, it's about putting your health and your family over politics. Let's start Monday with a quick recap. Last week, the voted against: Keeping communities safe with an Active Shooter Alert system Allowing everyone to cross state lines for health care \u2014 aka, taking away a basic right They voted against your safety & your freedom. Trump was so intent on overturning our election and stoking the violence at the Capitol that he attacked his own security team. This is what we just heard at the This is what the #GOP is defending. We just sent the first gun reform bill to the President\u2019s desk in years. I know today may feel hopeless - heartbreaking - but know that refuse to back down when it comes to building a more just, stronger America. No matter the fight. . and I met with parents and caregivers at to discuss Democrats' commitment to lowering costs for parents and supporting the critical work of early educators. We know the key to a strong economy is a child care system that works for working families. Republicans' sham impeachment inquiry has never been about the truth. It's about avenging Trump, undermining our democracy, and influencing the election. What a disgrace. When we said that MAGA Republicans weren't going to stop at abortion, this is what we met. Birth control. IVF. Nothing is safe until we guarantee everyone's right to reproductive freedom.", "Just years ago today, four young girls were killed in the brutal bombing of the St. Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. The anniversary of their murders is a painful reminder of what we lose when we let racism and hatred win. May we never forget. This week marked years since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated. In his final speech, he said he had \"been to the mountain top\" & \"seen the promise land.\u201d Let's honor his legacy by recommitting ourselves to the fight for justice & equality. ' Biden knows that too many Americans struggle with the crushing weight of student debt. That's why he's provided million Americans debt relief and created the SAVE Plan, the most affordable repayment plan ever. Visit to see how you can save. The Inflation Reduction Act is a huge deal. Not only will it lower prescription drug costs for millions of Americans, it will ensure rich corporations pay their fair share and help us address the climate crisis. This week, will send it to the President's desk. Today marks three years since January \u2014 a day that will always be known as one of discredit and disgrace. Our democracy prevailed. But we must continue to reject extremism and recommit ourselves to furthering our great pursuit of a more perfect union. It\u2019s been a tremendous honor serving in House Leadership. While I plan to remain in Congress, it\u2019s time to devote my energy to ensuring this country maintains its pursuit toward a more perfect union. The difference is clear: President Biden is taking strong actions to make our communities safer by expanding background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Trump did nothing. Big news: has now forgiven over BILLION in student loan debt for million people. By investing in our people, we invest in a brighter future for all. #PromisesKept This week the Biden Administration implemented the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act\u2019s expansion of background checks \u2014 the most significant expansion of background checks for gun purchases in decades. Closing the gun show loophole will save lives. Today, the South Carolina delegation took to the House Floor to celebrate winning this year's NCAA Women\u2019s Basketball National Championship. You have represented not only your school, but the entire state of South Carolina well. Go Gamecocks! .\u2019 new student loan forgiveness plan will benefit over MILLION borrowers who are stuck with insurmountable debt because of accrued interest. Higher education should be affordable and accessible for all. #PromisesKept Make no mistake: Trump is to blame for today\u2019s decision in Arizona and the erosion of the right to choose in states across the country.

Big News: just announced NEW student loan debt relief that would forgive: - Up to in runaway interest - Debt for borrowers who entered repayment years ago - Debt for borrowers eligible for forgiveness but have not applied Over million Americans will benefit.

A well-deserved triumph to a remarkable and undefeated season. jobs were added last month, bringing the total created under to million. While many prices are still too high, President Biden is fighting to lower costs as Republicans continue to side with the wealthy and special interests. The Affordable Connectivity Program made internet accessible to millions of households to help children learn, adults work, and seniors access healthcare. But the program will expire in April unless Republicans join Democrats to renew funding. I urge my colleagues to fund ACP. This \"Green Bank\" will rapidly accelerate America's clean energy transition and make right on Biden's Initiative, which seeks to direct at least of the benefits of federal climate spending to disadvantaged communities. It's a true game-changer. On the Anniversary of NATO, I'm reminded of President Truman's famous words: \u201cWe can well afford to pay the price of peace. Our only alternative is to pay the terrible cost of war.\u201d NATO is vital to global peace and stability. We must protect it. Former Columbia Mayor joined the White House Office of Public Engagement to help bridge divides and reconnect communities.

I am committed to bridging this gap and will continue fighting to make quality healthcare accessible and affordable for all. More than households in South Carolina are at risk of losing access to affordable, high-speed internet because some extreme Republicans refuse to renew the Affordable Connectivity Program. We ought to put politics aside and fund the ACP. Playing politics with the tragic bridge collapse in Baltimore is just plain cruel. We must help Baltimore get back on its feet. Full stop. Wishing a blessed and joyous Easter to all celebrating. May today bring peace and hope to you and your loved ones. I was proud to have secured federal funding for the Reach water project along the corridor. With today's groundbreaking, we are a step closer in our efforts to provide every South Carolinian with clean drinking water. On we honor the bravery of the Black military aviators in the U.S. Armed Forces, a group of which trained in Walterboro, SC. Though they were denied basic freedoms at home, the Tuskegee Airmen fought valiantly for our country's freedom abroad. Methane emissions account for of global warming. Yet every year, U.S. gas pipelines and wells leak enough methane to power homes. The Biden Administration is cracking down on these wasteful leaks - benefiting taxpayers and lowering emissions. Today, I was joined by at and to discuss the Biden-Harris efforts to lower prescription drug prices and improve access to maternal healthcare. High-quality healthcare should be affordable and accessible to all. March is a time for us to honor all the women who make history every day. As we celebrate their contributions to our communities and nation, this month I\u2019m going to share the stories of some of the women who inspire me every day. Septima Poinsette Clark was an SC native, educator, and activist who Martin Luther King Jr. deemed the \"mother of the movement\". Her teachings enfranchised African Americans and guided Rosa Parks months before her actions sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Months before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, South Carolinian Sarah Mae Flemming filed a lawsuit after a bus driver struck her and forced her to the back of a bus. Her case laid the groundwork for the successful Montgomery Bus lawsuit a year later. When President Obama was elected in over million Americans lacked health insurance. Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act, the biggest healthcare expansion since Medicare. years later, under Biden, more than million now have affordable ACA healthcare. This week, House Republicans passed bills that boost Big Oil's profits and eliminate environmental protections under the guise of \u201cunleashing American energy\u201d. In reality, under President Biden\u2019s leadership, American energy production & renewables growth is at a record high. Today\u2019s government funding bill rejects Republicans\u2019 extreme demands while investing in the American people. It helps secure the border, reduces the cost of living, improves public safety, and provides nearly million for projects in Thank you to for awarding me with your Congressional Arts Leadership Award at the Nancy Hanks Lecture on Arts and Public Policy.

Their dedication to their work and their community represents the best of who we are. Hidden junk fees cost Americans hundreds of dollars a year. Thanks to the Biden-Harris leadership, the recently adopted a new rule requiring cable and satellite TV companies to show the full price of their services up front. Americans from across the country \u2013 young and old, urban and rural, small business owners and teachers \u2013 are benefiting from 's student debt forgiveness actions. See how you can benefit at Breonna Taylor was a committed first responder that lived to help others. She should still be here today. On the anniversary of her death, I again call on my Republican colleagues to join Democrats and pass legislation that improves law enforcement practices and accountability. Today, women earn on average cents for every dollar men earn. That adds up to hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost wages for women over a career. On #EqualPayDay let's ensure that women across America receive equal pay for equal work by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. The same Trump judge who struck down ' student debt relief plan invalidated an agency \u2014created by Pres. Nixon \u2014that helps minority-owned businesses overcome barriers to accessing capital and government contracts. These attacks on progress must stop. Praying for a peaceful Ramadan for all Muslims observing. May this month be a time to reflect on and reaffirm our commitment to peace, compassion, and justice. Ramadan Kareem! I salute my great friend for her successful and visionary tenure as Secretary of HUD. She led the charge against the housing crisis and was a tireless advocate for \u201cthe least of these.\u201d She has my respect and admiration and will be missed. An incredible shot. Congratulations to and on advancing to the Championship! On this I\u2019m reflecting on all the women who have shaped my life and who will shape our nation\u2019s future. May we strive to create a world where all women and girls can thrive, grow, and realize their full potential. We made a promise to our veterans when we sent them to war. Last Congress, helped deliver on that promise by signing the PACT Act into law to ensure our toxin-exposed veterans have access to the care and benefits they deserve. #SOTU Democrats and negotiated the toughest immigration bill in decades. Trump demanded Republicans oppose it because he thought a crisis at the border would help him politically. Stop the political games. Let\u2019s pass the bipartisan border security bill. #SOTU . made a commitment to rebuild our economy and restore jobs lost to the pandemic. Today, he\u2019s delivered over million jobs, Black unemployment has reached historic lows, and inflation is falling. #PromisesKept #SOTU Republicans claim to support access to IVF, but when it comes down to it, they\u2019re trying to restrict women\u2019s reproductive rights every chance they can. and Congressional Democrats are fighting to preserve a woman\u2019s right to make their own reproductive decisions. #SOTU On this anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I'm reflecting on this year's congressional pilgrimage to Selma that I led to honor my dear friend John Lewis and those brave protesters. It was a special moment for me, and I am renewed to continue the fight for voting rights. During tonight's #SOTU address, will share his vision for what this country can be. He's driven inflation down, raised incomes, delivered student loan debt relief, and is working to bring this country together. #PromisesKept The House-passed government funding bill will keep our government open & working for the American people. This legislation fully funds WIC, supports affordable housing, invests in community health centers, and includes million for projects in The Biden Administration just finalized a rule to cut excessive credit card late fees, reducing the typical fee from to This is just another example of President Biden cutting costs for the American people. I was honored to join and her family today following her senior night. Best of luck to and in the tourney! As we commemorate and this anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I\u2019m thinking of those men and women that made tremendous sacrifices in the name of equality and justice. We must continue our fight until every American has equal access to the ballot box. There's nothing like family. I'm happy to have played a part in reuniting with hers. Thanks to . Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune was an SC native, trailblazing civil rights activist, trusted advisor to FDR, and one of my mom\u2019s heroes. A statue of her likeness now stands in the Capitol, the first Black American to represent a state in Statuary Hall. I applaud for listening to EJ leaders & other stakeholders in our mutual goal to tackle the climate crisis. This will allow the EPA to work on a durable rule that reduces emissions while ensuring energy is affordable & accessible for all. To mark the end of I reflected on how MAGA Republicans' efforts to ban books, suppress Black history, and strip women of their reproductive freedoms are straight out of the old playbook. My Last night, Republican Senators blocked a bill to protect access to IVF nationwide. MAGA Republicans claim to support IVF, but when it comes down to it, they\u2019re fighting to restrict women\u2019s reproductive rights at every turn. The Brady Bill was signed into law years ago \u2014 legislation mandating background checks for gun sales. Today, in guns are sold without a background check through various loopholes. We must keep pushing to expand background checks and ensure guns don't fall into the wrong\u2026 Republicans have once again put us on the verge of a government shutdown. Many essential government services \u2014 including programs for our veterans \u2014 will be paused. Make no mistake: House Republicans will own a possible government shutdown. Over South Carolinians will receive student loan debt forgiveness this month because of ' SAVE Plan. These are hardworking Americans who've been repaying their loans for years. Visit to enroll in the SAVE plan today. #PromisesKept Democrats warned that MAGA Republicans wouldn\u2019t stop at Roe v. Wade. Now they\u2019ve set their sights on eliminating access to IVF. Millions of parents, from all walks of life and political affiliations, have used IVF to start a family. Radical conservative judges won't stop at\u2026 Instead of addressing pressing domestic and international priorities, House Republicans engaged in a months-long sham investigation into the President fueled by lies and Russian disinformation. Stop the politics and pass the national security bill so we can support our allies. After Trump\u2019s Supreme Court struck down ' student loan forgiveness plan, he vowed to keep fighting. Today, people enrolled in the new SAVE plan who borrowed less than and made payments for years have had their debt cancelled. #PromisesKept Happy #PresidentsDay! Today, I\u2019m reflecting on all the great leaders of our country who have kept us moving toward a more perfect union. From creating million jobs to providing billion in student loan debt relief, it\u2019s clear is delivering for the American people. Alexei Navalny's crime was daring to believe that Russia could one day become a true democracy. My thoughts are with his family, loved ones, and supporters. His courage should serve as an inspiration to us all. We must not stand by while Putin expands his brutal regime. I was at church when I was handed a letter a constituent had written . In it, he thanked President Biden for his work to tackle student loan debt relief. Not only was his balance forgiven, he received a refund.

It has since saved million lives. On National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, I'm continuing my calls to reauthorize PEPFAR so we can keep saving lives from this disease. #NBHAAD House Republicans' standalone Israel bill was a cynical exercise in extreme partisanship that was doomed to fail. We have a bipartisan agreement that would honor our commitments to our allies, secure the border, and address humanitarian needs. They are once again putting\u2026 Extreme MAGA Republicans' attempt to impeach Secretary Mayorkas was just another partisan stunt to distract from their inability to govern. They refuse to address the situation at the border. They refuse to pass bills to better the lives of the American people. Americans deserve\u2026 Without further funding from Congress, the Affordable Connectivity Program may come to an end in April As a result, new applications will not be accepted after February I will keep urging my colleagues in Congress to pass additional funding for this critical program. I'm deeply saddened by Joe Madison's passing. \"The Black Eagle\" dedicated his life to moving justice forward and challenging the status quo. An invaluable advocate for the Black community, and personal friend and confidant, he will truly be missed. May he Rest in Peace. The economy added another jobs in January \u2014 almost double what the Dow Jones expected. Wages are up from this time last year. Yet another sign the economy is strong and growing under Today we embark on a time for us to reflect on the contributions of Black Americans to the history and progress of our great nation. Black history is interwoven into the fabric of America. It's critical that we embrace this history, not erase it. Ida M. Fuller received the first Social Security check on January a few years after the program was created. This new program allowed Ms. Fuller to retire in dignity. Today, Republicans want to cut Social Security. We can't let that happen. . promised to expand access to affordable healthcare \u2014 and he did. A record million Americans signed up for ACA coverage for Despite Republicans' calls to repeal it, the ACA is more popular than ever, and Congressional Dems will fight to protect it. The economy grew at a pace last quarter, once again crushing expectations. Combined with falling inflation and rising wages, this is yet another sign that the U.S. economy is on strong footing under \u2019 leadership. On January the landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade protected a woman's right to choose. Nearly years later, the Supreme Court stripped that right away. and Congressional Democrats will keep fighting to restore access to reproductive care. . just announced he\u2019s forgiving another billion in student debt \u2014 that\u2019s BILLION in years.

Theaters bring people together, enrich our communities, and grow the economy. I\u2019m glad to advocate for our bill to support nonprofit theaters\u2014the STAGE Act\u2014with talented artists like Danai Gurira and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. The science is clear: exposure to certain PFAS are linked to harmful health effects. This new EPA rule to establish the first-ever nationwide, legally enforceable drinking water standards is necessary to protect communities from PFAS in their drinking water. Every student deserves an education free from discrimination and harassment. As a leader on , I\u2019ll continue to defend LGBTQI+ students against extremist politicians who seek to pass discriminatory policies. #DayOfNoSilence There are more options today for student loan borrowers to receive debt forgiveness and to make loan repayment more affordable. Because of the progress we\u2019ve made, another borrowers will see their balances forgiven. We\u2019ve made significant progress to make student loan repayment easier, but there is still much more we can do to help borrowers and make college more affordable. The stories I heard at my roundtable discussion will help inform my work in Congress with . This Week of the Young Child, we celebrate our youngest learners and the educators who help nurture their developing minds. Our children's futures depend on the strong foundation we provide today. It was great to meet with Senior Airman Halvorson at my D.C. office. SrA Halvorson is from Hillsboro and currently stationed in Virginia, where he received an annual award for his exceptional service to our country. This is a major step toward ending one of the biggest loopholes in our federal system of background checks. A new rule from will help expand background check requirements to gun shows and better prevent gun violence in our communities. Reminder: My staff will be holding a student loan workshop with a virtual option today in Tillamook, and will be joined by student loan expert Lane Thompson. To RSVP and get more information on the student loan workshop series, please visit here: Thank you to the leadership at \u2019s Portland Station for showing me around the facilities and providing an update on current operations. The U.S. Coast Guard has a critically important mission that benefits the safety and security of our region and the communities that rely on the ocean and our rivers. In my conversations with nonprofit theater directors and artists across NW Oregon, I\u2019ve heard that many are still struggling after the pandemic. The STAGE Act will provide additional support to help these organizations recover and rebuild. Eid Mubarak! As the month of Ramadan comes to a close, I hope everyone observing has a joyous celebration with their family, friends, and community. Updating the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act will help promote economic security and grow the middle class. I\u2019m pleased that the bipartisan update we passed today includes provisions from the ACCESS Act, the bill I lead with . These updates to WIC\u2014 which I advocated for\u2014will help moms, pregnant women & children access the healthy and nutritious food they need. The new guidelines also add greater flexibility so families receive food that better corresponds with their dietary needs & cultural preferences. I had a wonderful time meeting with children, educators, and community leaders at Mindful Montessori in Beaverton. The school is part of the West Side Works collaboration to help prospective early childhood educators gain the support, experience, and connections they need to have successful careers. Reminder: My staff will be holding a student loan workshop with student loan expert Lane Thompson today in Portland. To RSVP and get more information, please visit here: I appreciated the opportunity to speak with advocates for student loan borrowers, students, and higher education representatives about the challenges with loan repayment and the progress we\u2019ve made under the Biden administration to reform and improve the student loan system. College students shouldn\u2019t be saddled with a lifetime of debt. I will keep fighting for affordable, accessible higher education. It\u2019s exciting to see EPA award billion for a national clean financing network that will help finance clean projects, like installing community solar, in communities in Oregon and other parts of the country. Importantly, these funds will be directed to low-income and marginalized are most affected by the climate crisis and air pollution. I had a productive conversation with the Forest Grove and Cornelius Chamber of Commerce and local leaders. This area has grown significantly in recent years, and I appreciated hearing about how we can be partners on issues like education and workforce and how the Chamber is supporting local businesses and entrepreneurs. The homes we build need infrastructure around them. I joined Admin. Berke at a roundtable discussion with local leaders where we talked about the challenges and opportunities around expanding affordable housing and basic infrastructure like wastewater and broadband. It was inspiring to join Administrator Berke at the site of \u2019s Countryman Estates. The funding I helped secure will go toward building homes that will be owned by community members in Forest Grove. Mass timber benefits Oregon\u2019s environment and economy. It was exciting to learn more about this innovative industry and its progress at the International Mass Timber Conference in Portland. I will continue to support the work of local leaders and researchers and look forward to seeing what the future of mass timber holds. Portland has one of the best food scenes in the world, and the Central Eastside is the heart of many local businesses that make products Oregonians enjoy in restaurants and their kitchens. I visited Dos Hermanos Bakery and Olympia Provisions, where I learned more from staff about their businesses. Trans rights are human rights, and on Trans Day of Visibility we must recommit to protecting and supporting the trans community amid ongoing attacks from extremist politicians. Trans people should be able to live freely and safely as themselves. Happy Easter to everyone celebrating in NW Oregon and across the country! We need more affordable housing units for everyone, but especially for the most vulnerable \u2014including seniors. It was great to celebrate the new investment to retrofit Oak Apartments in Portland and make them safer and more energy efficient. The expanded Child Tax Credit cut childhood poverty in half. Congress must bring it back. I\u2019m committed to working with Sen Wyden and local leaders to help children and families and build an economy that works for everyone. It is a testament to the work of advocates, providers, policymakers, and everyday Oregonians that our state earned a B+ \u2014the highest rating in the nation\u2014for our care policies. But there are many gaps that exist in our care infrastructure, and the federal government can do more to support families and care providers in Oregon and across the country. Need help with your student loans? My staff and student loan expert Lane Thompson will be holding a series of student loan workshops around NW Oregon. To RSVP and learn more, visit here: Jailing people who are experiencing homelessness will not address the fundamental lack of affordable and supportive housing. I agree with my fellow Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Homelessness that we need to focus on the policies that actually secure housing for all. We will never stop fighting to protect, restore, and expand access to abortion care. I was grateful to stand with many strong advocates for reproductive rights at Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette. Decisions about the safety and efficacy of medications should be made by medical experts, not judges or politicians. Today SCOTUS heard a case that has the potential to limit access to mifepristone, which would further undermine access to abortion and reproductive health care. I wish everyone celebrating Holi today a bright and colorful festival full of joy! Funneling federal funding to risky charter schools is not a solution to the real problems that affect public education. The bill we considered would result in federal funding going to proposed charter schools that have no record of success, or even to proposed schools that never open. We should use our public resources to fully fund IDEA, expand the school nutrition program, and support to Title I schools, which have higher population of low-income students. The federal justice system relies on dedicated federal defenders to fulfill the constitutional rights of people accused of a crime. These offices have been forced to operate on budgets that are too low for too long, & I have been leading bipartisan efforts for increased funding. We passed an important increase for Defender Services, but we have more work to do to guarantee everyone's right to counsel and to fully support our federal public defenders. The Republican Study Committee, which represents of the House GOP, proposed a budget that slashes funding to Social Security and raises the age of retirement to Instead of attacking earned benefits, we should be working to strengthen programs like Social Security and Medicare so they continue to serve Americans well into the future. My colleague and I stand in solidarity with Filipino leaders here and in the Philippines to call for the Philippine Human Rights Act now. #passthePHRAnow Aging water systems are a health hazard, but the cost of repairing this critical infrastructure can be a significant burden on ratepayers. The close to million I helped secured for Clean Water Services to replace aging pipes will benefit communities in Forest Grove, Cornelius and Gaston. For years, many Oregonians and Americans made academic and educational decisions based on the promise of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF) but have been denied the relief they earned because of flaws with the system. This latest action from the Biden Administration will forgive the remaining debt for thousands of people who were enrolled in PSLF. A million investment from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will help reconnect the lower Albina District, which was divided decades ago by the construction of By working with local communities, tribes, advocates, and businesses, we are crafting solutions that uplift that don't repeat the mistakes of the past. The Beaverton Loop will create safer connections for people traveling in downtown Beaverton, boosting the local economy & improving the livability in the neighborhood. I helped secure close to million for the project, along with million I brought to the project last year. Our work as policymakers should be aimed at encouraging diverse, equitable, and inclusive learning environments for students of all ages. Instead, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to stoke culture wars by misrepresenting the purpose of DEI programs and initiatives. In the years since it was signed into law, the has advanced health equity in the U.S. Millions of people who could not afford health care otherwise now are covered under ACA plans. We must continue to strengthen ACA to better serve all Americans. Investments from the CHIPS and Science Act in Oregon\u2019s Silicon Forest will help our region remain one of the world\u2019s most important semiconductor and technology ecosystems. Importantly, this project will create thousands of sustainable, family-wage jobs. Intel has proactively prepared skilled workers to fill these positions by forming ongoing partnerships with the public school system and Portland Community College to develop workforce programs like Quick Start. It was exciting to hear more about CRESCENT, the new Cascadia Region Earthquake Science Center. This center is focused on earthquakes at subduction zones and is a partnership between researchers at UO, PSU, and other universities and institutions. CRESCENT recently received a grant from NSF, and their work will help prepare our region for a potential Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. College is not affordable for many students, and aid programs have not kept up with increasing costs. I appreciated the opportunity to discuss college affordability with higher education leaders in Oregon and hear their priorities regarding federal student aid. The Labor of Love exhibit at the PSU Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art sheds a necessary light on the unseen and work that keeps our society running. I invited some labor leaders to join me on a great tour of the exhibit, and we got to meet and hear from Midori Hirose, one of the talented artists. The show runs through April It is long past time for the U.S. to ban asbestos. I\u2019ve spent years advocating for asbestos to be banned, and am grateful for the steps the EPA is taking today to finalize its rule to prohibit the import and use of chrysotile asbestos. This action will save lives. Happy Transit Worker Appreciation Day! Transit workers are on the frontline of reducing emissions from our transportation system, and legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are helping deliver cleaner and quieter EV buses to drivers in school districts and transit agencies. Pier is vital for the North Coast's fishing and seafood industries, but the deteriorating structure requires significant rehabilitation. I helped secure million for Pier with my colleagues Sen. Wyden and Sen. Merkley, in addition to the more than million in infrastructure dollars awarded last year. I look forward to seeing how these upgrades and repairs help invigorate the community. We wrote and passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law so it could help reconnect communities like Albina that were torn apart by racist and discriminatory highway projects. It was an honor to join Sen. Wyden, Sen. Merkley, Rep. Blumenauer, and many community partners at Albina Vision Trust to celebrate the investment we secured to revitalize this historically Black neighborhood. Columbia Memorial Hospital in Astoria is part of the North Coast\u2019s essential infrastructure, & it was exciting to learn how CMH is building a resilient hospital to better serve the community for everyday health care needs & if there is an earthquake, tsunami, or other disaster. I advocated for the million grant this project received from FEMA, and I will continue to look for opportunities to support resiliency efforts on the North Coast. It was wonderful to visit Trillium House in Warrenton and hear from residents and providers about how having secure, affordable housing with wraparound services has changed and saved lives. I also heard about the critical need for more developments like Trillium to address the homelessness and affordable housing crisis. Clatsop County has one of the highest rates of homelessness per capita in Oregon. Reconnecting the Lower Albina neighborhood is an important step that will help correct past wrongs that split a thriving Black community in Portland. I\u2019m grateful to have helped secure federal investment to revitalize this historic district. We must continue working to address injustice and create a safer, more inclusive future for everyone in Portland, in our state, and across the county. The TikTok bill, named the \u201cProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\u201d was up for a vote today. I voted no. The National Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) serves millions every year and helps reduce hunger among children and adults with disabilities. During CACFP Week we recognize the importance of this vital program. We also must recognize and break down the barriers to accessing CACFP. During a recent roundtable conversation about youth homelessness, I heard from providers that the paperwork and strict guidelines around nutrition are too burdensome to make CACFP worthwhile. My Early Childhood Nutrition Improvement Act would streamline CACFP and add flexibility so more care providers can participate in the program. I'm pleased to work with my colleague to lead this bill and the CACFP Week resolution. Women and men with equal qualifications should get equal pay. This #EqualPayDay, I join my colleagues in advocating for policies that will help close the persistent wage gap. Artificial intelligence has great potential, but we must address the potential for bias in its algorithms. This legislation will protect job applicants by helping to prevent AI-based hiring discrimination and increasing transparency about hiring practices. We have significant work ahead of us to clean up and prevent marine debris, and the Save Our Seas Amendments Act continues to build on our bipartisan foundation to protect the ocean. It\u2019s time for the Congressional Art Competition! Student artists need to submit artwork by no later than on April A panel of artists will select the winner and their work will be displayed at the U.S. Capitol. More information here: Ramadan Mubarak to everyone observing in NW Oregon and across the world! I hope your Ramadan is filled with family, community, and spiritual renewal. The affordable housing crisis affects every community across NW Oregon and the country. The actions announced by President Biden will help more people afford a home and increase investments for housing construction and rehabilitation. On International Women\u2019s Day, we continue the fight for gender equality in the US and around the world. Together with my colleagues, I\u2019m working to protect reproductive rights, end gender-based violence, and build a world where every woman can thrive. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act was a step in the right direction to end gun violence, but too many in our country continue to lose their lives in senseless shootings. Commonsense gun violence prevention laws, including an assault weapons ban, can help save lives. What the Biden Administration and the Democratic majority in the last Congress accomplished stands in clear contrast to the dysfunction and extremist priorities of the current House majority. Last Congress, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in climate action. According to Climate Power, the bill has helped create clean energy jobs. One of the first bills the House GOP brought to the floor was legislation that would strip away climate protections, increase give outs to Big Oil companies, and gut the IRA. Today is the anniversary of Bloody Sunday, when marchers for civil my former colleague the late, great Rep. John Lewis\u2014were brutally beaten after crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge. We can honor their legacy by passing strong legislation to restore and protect voting rights. The expanded Child Tax Credit lifted families out of poverty and gave them financial breathing room to plan for their future. It\u2019s one of the best tools we have to grow the middle class, and it\u2019s time for Congress to make it permanent. I\u2019ve been working to fix our broken student loan system since I was elected to Congress. The progress we\u2019ve made under the Biden Administration is significant, and many more borrowers are finally seeing the forgiveness they\u2019ve earned. And the administration has gone after unscrupulous for-profit colleges that defrauded students. The Biden Administration continues to pursue options for broader student debt relief after the Supreme Court blocked the original student debt plan. We know that anti-choice activists won\u2019t stop their attacks on reproductive healthcare with the overturning of Roe. Access to contraceptives, medication abortion, and even IVF treatment has been threatened by extremist politicians and judges. The Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats are working to protect reproductive freedom. Everyone should have the right to make intensely personal healthcare decisions without interference from elected officials or the courts. The fentanyl crisis is serious and complicated, but there\u2019s something we can do that will save lives. My guest for the SOTU, Jon (), has helped prevent deaths from overdose through advocating for fentanyl awareness education. Hear his story: WIC provides healthy food to new moms, pregnant women & babies, but a funding shortfall put those benefits at risk. I led the call for fully funding WIC with my colleagues on & , & I\u2019m glad that the House bill we passed will close the funding gap. My staff and I have appreciated working with Jon Epstein over the past year on increasing access to fentanyl awareness education in schools. Today he had the opportunity to meet my D.C. staff (and Rigby!). A NW Oregon family successfully resolved an issue with their green cards after contacting my office. If you need help with a federal agency, please reach out by visiting my website at or by calling at Happy Women in Construction Week! Federal investments in infrastructure and clean energy are creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, and we won\u2019t be able to fill these positions without extending these opportunities to women. When visited Oregon, we spoke with Kristy, who talked about the general lack of awareness among women about jobs in the trades. Local organizations like are working to remove barriers and help more women access fulfilling careers in construction and the trades. Great news: the House passed a spending bill that includes close to million in federal investments for NW Oregon! The projects included will address housing affordability, aging infrastructure, climate change, access to wraparound support services, and more. I urge the Senate to pass this bill promptly. You can read more about it here: Congratulations to Garibaldi for being designated as a Coast Guard City - the in the country! Coast Guard members and their families make countless contributions to communities across the North Coast, and Garibaldi\u2019s strong support for the USCG is recognized through this designation. It was an honor to introduce Mayor Beaty at the Beaverton State of the City. I appreciate representing Beaverton in Congress, and I\u2019ve enjoyed working with Mayor Beaty and City of Beaverton on shared priorities like housing and access to transit. Many communities are experiencing hunger, and Congress should do more to help local organizations working to address food insecurity. I\u2019m leading legislation like the STORE Act to better support food pantries like Neighborhood House\u2019s Free Food Market. I met Jon and Jennifer Epstein in Beaverton last year, and their advocacy to educate students about the dangers of fentanyl inspired my bipartisan Fentaynl Awareness for Children and Teens in Schools (FACTS) Act. I\u2019m grateful that Jon will be my guest at this year\u2019s State of the Union. For the first time, the federal government has funding specifically to help manufactured housing communities. Manufactured housing can be the only affordable housing option in some areas, but often these communities don\u2019t have money to make necessary repairs and upgrades. This million from the PRICE program will help. Thank you to Aloha High School for the great visit! I got to see & learn about several of their CTE programs, including child development & an amazing music exploration class with lots of guitars & electronic drum sets. And I had the opportunity to help serve lunch to students. The already has some electric school buses, but they\u2019re getting more. Recently BSD received million from the EPA\u2019s clean school bus program to purchase new electric school buses! This will benefit the students, bus drivers, and the planet. Great news: starting on March all veterans who were exposed to toxins and other hazards during their service are eligible to enroll directly in VA health care. This is a key provision of the PACT Act, the largest expansion of veterans\u2019 healthcare in years. Outdoor recreation is a cherished part of our state\u2019s culture and economy. It\u2019s great to see that Oregon is receiving more than million from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restore and conserve habitat for fish and wildlife and better connect people with nature. This we celebrate the contributions of women in American history & recognize the need to build on that progress. On child care, paid leave, equal pay, abortion rights, & more, my colleagues & I will continue our advocacy on behalf of women. These updates to the Child Care Development Block Grant will help lower child care costs for families and improve timely compensation for providers. The child care industry is still struggling after the expiration of key funding, and Congress must provide a robust investment in CCDBG and other programs to prevent children and families from losing care. The Dobbs decision puts the full range of reproductive care at risk. The Alabama Supreme Court ruling threatening access to IVF treatment is the latest disturbing example of the consequences of overturning Roe. I stood with my colleagues to urge Congress to protect IVF care. Social Security is an earned benefit. We can protect and stabilize it by lifting the cap on income. It\u2019s time to #ScrapTheCap. There is no one more qualified to lead the Department of Labor than Acting Secretary Su. I\u2019m pleased to see the Senate HELP panel has advanced her nomination, and I hope the full Senate confirms her soon. The Brady Bill has been law for more than years. Since then, its background check system has saved lives by preventing close to million prohibited gun purchases. Brady is one of the best tools we have to prevent gun violence and we should expand it. What a great tour at the training facility and offices in Beaverton! The preparation and level of care from the players and staff is impressive, and it shows up in what fans experience on match day. Thanks to the Ballmer Institute for the visit. I leaned more about the innovative work that\u2019s underway to prepare educators and behavior health workers to better address the mental and behavioral health needs of children and youth. Many young people are experiencing behavioral health struggles after the pandemic, but too many can\u2019t access treatment because there aren\u2019t enough services. Building up the behavioral health care workforce will help close these gaps. Neighborhood House does great work, and I had the opportunity to learn more about some of their programs in Multnomah Village. First, we visited the Free Food Market. The staff and volunteers provide a wide variety of groceries, but the need outstrips the current space. I also met with some line dancers at a class at the Neighborhood House senior center! Classes like this help promote exercise and coordination, & provide a space for people to socialize. I\u2019ll continue to look for ways to support Neighborhood House & the Oregonians they serve. Thank you to for inviting me visit a rehearsal. It was great to speak with the young musicians about civic participation and the importance of arts and arts education. It was an honor to welcome to Oregon! We had an inspiring meeting with leaders from RISE Partnership, an innovative labor management partnership that created a paid apprenticeship program to prepare people to work in the care economy. In the words of Michelle, a RISE graduate\u2013 the program provides enough support that people can \u201cstay in the field they love.\u201d The work of caregivers is essential, but it\u2019s often undervalued and underpaid. The RISE model shows that we can make our care system more sustainable for workers and employers and improve health outcomes for people who need care. I appreciate having a strong pro-worker advocate like lead the , and dedicated local leaders who are working across the state to provide workers with safety and dignity at work. We had a great discussion about building a pro-worker movement in Oregon. Two years ago Putin started an unprovoked and horrific attack against Ukraine. I continue to support all diplomatic and economic tools to protect the lives and freedom of Ukrainians. We must expedite urgently needed assistance for Ukraine so this war will come to an end and the Ukrainian people can begin to rebuild their homeland. I call on the Speaker of the House to bring up the bill for a vote immediately. . and I heard from incredible local organizations like about how opportunities like their planned EV charging program transform lives. The Biden Investing in America agenda is making a positive difference in Oregon and across the country. The jobs we create through federal investment need to be good jobs and need to be available to communities that have too often been left behind. I\u2019m grateful that and the Biden administration are leading this historic effort. It was wonderful to celebrate the latest graduates of \u2019s QuickStart program with . QuickStart gives students training and support that will prepare them for family-wage jobs in the semiconductor industry. When we crafted and passed the CHIPS and Science Act, it was important to include investments in semiconductor workers. The students we met today show how this bill can change lives. It\u2019s great to see that about borrowers had their student loan balances forgiven through the SAVE plan. The plan is lowering monthly payments for many borrowers, with more benefits coming in July. For more information see my website: The investments we make in children are some of the best investments we can make. But the organizations caring for some of the most vulnerable youth\u2014those experiencing expected to do too much with too little. The local leaders I met with have compelling stories about turning lives around, but we need to remove some barriers \u2013 including the requirement that they have to submit an page application yearly for the limited federal funding they can access. These experiences and insights will help inform my work on updating the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. I appreciated the opportunity to meet with leadership and learn more about their business and the new microfluidics tech hub they\u2019re leading with university and semiconductor industry partners in Oregon. Microfluidics can be used to cool computer chips, which will help data centers become more energy efficient. The grade students I visited at Imlay Elementary in Hillsboro were focused, engaged, and thoughtful. They also were having a lot of fun during their arts class led by a teacher with Right Brain Initiative. The class was a great example of how arts education helps to engage students and teach them how to think creatively about complex concepts. My Arts Education for All bill will increase access to the benefits of arts education. Artificial Intelligence has tremendous potential to improve lives, but that potential also poses significant risks that must not be ignored. I\u2019m honored to serve on this bipartisan AI taskforce and look forward to working with my colleagues to promote the responsible and ethical development and use of AI. Happy Presidents\u2019 Day! It\u2019s a great time to remember the importance of civics education and learning from history. Thank you to the YMCA of the USA and the Oregon State Alliance of YMCAs for selecting me for this year\u2019s Congressional Champion Award. And thank you for all you do in our communities to provide care, build connections, and promote healthy living. Thanks to my colleague for the bipartisan discussion about Career and Technical Education.

The American people deserve better than stopgap measures. I look forward to voting on year-long funding packages in the coming weeks. Last week, I was honored to lecture at the on how public policy can eliminate poverty. We have the resources here - in the wealthiest country in the world - to eradicate poverty several times over. Poverty is a policy choice. We must choose differently. This I'm reflecting on the women who broke barriers and paved the way for all of us. And I promise to continue fighting to ensure access to the rights and freedoms that belong to all women. It was great to be joined by last week for a town hall discussion on the Inflation Reduction Act. This historic legislation saves taxpayers money, promotes green energy, and protects the environment. I was proud to vote for it. This is unconscionable. We need an immediate ceasefire, and an increase in humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza by land, sea, and air. If we don\u2019t, the scale of the mass starvation event playing out will be catastrophic. We have a responsibility to prevent further loss of life. In SCOTUS wasted no time delivering the presidency to the GOP candidate. In SCOTUS is wasting as much time as they can, to deliver the presidency to the GOP candidate.

A law is passed to outlaw race-based hair discrimination so they say \"oh, its not about his protective hair style, its about the length. Look at that picture and tell me his hair is \"too long\" Anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness.

New Jersey is one of a handful of states to require Black history be taught in Elementary and Secondary schools. Nationally, only of history class time is devoted to Black history, and some states neglect the subject altogether. Black history IS American History. That's why I introduced the Black History Matters Act to ensure that every student has access to a quality education and that our education systems teach curriculums that reflect the rich history of our country. This we celebrate the countless contributions of Black Americans and recognize that Black history is American history. Our nation's entire story must be told - that means carrying the lessons we learn this month into conversations & classrooms all year round. I was honored earlier this month to join QIDMA of Franklin Township for Noor Night to commemorate NJ's first annual A beautiful acknowledgement of our Muslim communities and their contributions to our state's rich and diverse culture.

Congratulations to the winner of Congressional App Challenge, \"Bryt Minds\" by West Windsor Plainsboro High School North's Audrey Chen! Bryt Minds creates a platform for peers to tutor one another, creating a broader community of learning. Today I introduced a resolution honoring the anniversary of the War on Poverty. This landmark initiative reduced poverty by in the first years it was implemented. While this was a great step forward, there is still much work to be done. Today, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a catalyst for change. Let us draw inspiration from his example in our ongoing pursuit of justice, equity, and ensuring equal opportunities for all.

I look forward to Congress passing the rest of the WORK to Save Lives Act to ensure more workplaces have access to this lifesaving medication.

LBJ\u2019s programs had an immediate impact, drawing down poverty rates. However progress has stalled. It\u2019s time we pass a Jobs Guarantee and Income Guarantee to finally drop poverty into the dustbin of history. I've got bills for both of these. Guaranteed Income: Guarantee: Today commemorates year since the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols. Video of Tyre\u2019s killing horrified the nation. His story serves as a painful reminder of the work we still need to do in addressing the ongoing injustice and brutality that Black people face in our country. For me and many others, the trauma of January still weighs heavily on our minds, bodies, and souls. Among us was Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died from injuries sustained that day. We continue to honor the memory of those lost by upholding the values that have guided our nation for over centuries. Today is also the Epiphany or Three Kings Day. Looking at the replays on television of people storming the Capitol on and not a wise man in the years ago, received orders to attack the US Capitol. The events of Jan. were a direct assault on the very foundation of our democracy: the right to have your vote counted. Democracy is not inevitable; it takes work and it takes defending. Today, in response to migrants being bussed from Texas to New Jersey, I sent a letter with my colleagues and to committing to work together on an efficient and compassionate state, local and federal response. NJ is one of the most diverse states in the country. of our people are foreign-born, another have immigrant parents. We understand immigrants add to the rich fabric of our state. Abbott may be trying to shame NJ cities but we'll show him what community really means. Ultimately Abbott is simply cribbing from the white supremacist playbook. The first \"Reverse Freedom Rides\" in the brought Black folks from the South to Northern cities like Trenton. Those who came made NJ a better place, and so will the new arrivals Above all, we will ensure the people who have arrived - as well as our towns and cities receiving them - get the support and resources they need. Wishing everyone a very happy and prosperous New Year! May this year bring peace, laughter, and countless opportunities to grow and learn. Wishing you a joyous Kwanzaa filled with health, love, and discovery. As you light the Kinara candles, may they serve as a reminder to cherish your loved ones and the bonds that unite us.

Today, as we mark years since the Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting, let's stand together in mourning and honor the victims by advocating for meaningful action to prevent gun violence in our communities. Another week, another toothless resolution from House Republicans that condemns antisemitism but does nothing to combat it. A recent poll suggested a significant number of young people don\u2019t know the basic facts about the Holocaust. Will Republicans support fully funding our schools to fight this ignorance? Will they support training on prevention and response? Will they support programs shown to help people escape from the influence of hate groups? Or will we return from the holiday break to a full docket of GOP vanity resolutions that fail to even scratch the surface of ending hate in our country? Thank you ! To see our discussion on nutrition and the impact of federal legislation you can watch the entire panel here: Whether hate manifests as racism, islamophobia, antisemitism, transphobia, or any other form, hate has no place in our communities.

Since Parkland, there have been over gun-related deaths\u2014that is unacceptable. I'm committed to working with to end this public health epidemic. #RepostYourRage Because of President Biden and Democrats, over Americans have signed up for quality, affordable health coverage through the this year. Gun violence is a policy choice, not an inevitability. My #KellyReport details how we can build a safer future for all. Extreme MAGA Republicans are doubling down on their attempts to weaken Social Security and Medicare. This scheme would raise the retirement age and make it more difficult for Americans to access their hard-earned benefits. Children are of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients. Congress must strengthen SNAP to ensure that no child in our nation is forced to go hungry. The #KellyReport convenes our nation\u2019s leading gun violence prevention advocates and researchers. Gun violence is a public health crisis, it's time we treat it like one.", "I\u2019m honored that my colleagues selected me to serve as chairman. It\u2019s a humbling day for a guy who enlisted in the yrs ago. To our veterans: know I'll continue fighting every day to ensure you receive the care, benefits & respect you've earned. I visited the Big House Fish Farm in Carbondale to discuss crop insurance, disaster relief, & the cost input in aquaculture. We had some useful discussions about the challenges that fish farmers face in our area, & ways we can continue working together to support this industry. I visited the MidAmerica Airport to speak with local officials, including St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern and Airport Director Darren James, about recent expansion projects. It was great to get an update on all the hard work being put into expanding operations at the airport and consider ways to continue fostering growth in tourism here in Southern Illinois. Today I met with students from Hamilton County High School, who were in the nation\u2019s capital for a school trip. I enjoyed hearing about their visit and answering questions about our work in Washington. If your local school is interested in visiting us in D.C., just reach out to our office at to discuss! My staff will be hosting mobile office hours in Nashville on Friday, April to give Washington County residents an opportunity to talk with our casework experts about any questions you may have regarding veterans\u2019 benefits, Social Security, Medicare, the IRS and more. We look forward to being your advocate and doing all we can to help. If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out to our Mascoutah office at I met with members of the Mid-America Carpenters Regional Council in Freeburg, where we discussed apprenticeship programs and other ways to grow participation in the building trades. With steady hands, these skilled craftsmen have, quite literally, built our communities and our businesses. It was great to discuss how we can continue feeding a pipeline of talented men and women into the industry so that it will remain strong for years to come. Today is Gold Star Spouses Day, a day to recognize and honor the spouses of military members who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. Our grateful nation stands with them, offering support, gratitude, and remembrance. Kinmundy Mayor Angela Diss gave me a wonderful tour of the historic Log Cabin Village this week. In the Erma Ingram started acquiring log cabins from the surrounding area when the structures from the began rapidly vanishing. These historic cabins are still on display today, and they will be hosting a day festival for the upcoming solar eclipse. Southern Illinois is full of rich history, thank you for the tour, Mayor Diss! I toured Flex n Gate with local community leaders this week, which is a leading manufacturer and supplier of large stamped metal and welded components, assemblies, and plastic parts in the automotive industry. I visited Davita Dialysis in Effingham this week. It was a pleasure getting a tour from facility administrator Leigh Hammer, thank you for sharing the challenges dialysis patients face and how providers are giving care during a nursing shortage. Happy Easter, Southern Illinois! Tracy and I are wishing you and your family a wonderful day as we celebrate our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. On this National we honor the brave men and women who served during the Vietnam War for their sacrifice and bravery. Thank you for your service. The fact that Harvard is planning to show 'How To Blow Up A Pipeline' is ridiculous. This film promotes eco-terrorism and is a risk to our national security. That's why I introduced the Pipeline Sabotage and Accident Prevention Act to punish eco-terrorism. Big thank you to Chairman Graves for including my bill in the Pipeline Efficiency and Safety Act of Americans remain worried about immigration! Almost half of respondents in a recent poll say that Biden\u2019s \u201cbiggest failure as president\u201d was pushing his open border policy and causing this historic flood of illegal immigration. Since Biden took office there have been over MILLION illegal encounters at our southern border, and the American people want to see action taken to protect our nation from this invasion. That\u2019s why I proudly voted for and helped pass the Secure the Border Act, to rebuild the wall, support our border patrol agents, and end catch and release policies. On this National join me in recognizing the brave Americans who have earned our nation\u2019s highest military award for valor and bravery. Thank you for your courageous service! Today I voted NO on another trillion-dollar spending compromise that failed to address the invasion at our southern border. The American people desperately want to know their government is doing what it takes to keep them safe and using their taxpayer dollars wisely. My staff will be hosting mobile office hours in Robinson on Tuesday, March to give you an opportunity to talk with our casework experts about any questions you may have regarding veterans\u2019 benefits, Social Security, Medicare, the IRS, and a host of other federal programs. We look forward to being your advocate and doing all we can to help. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to our Effingham office at I had a great discussion with the Illinois Pork Association today about dangerous Prop policies out of California that would require unrealistic enclosure requirements when raising pigs. These policies will cost farmers over per sow, and local farmers can\u2019t take that kind of financial burden. Illinois is the fourth largest pork producing state in the country, and our agricultural production should not be dictated by California or any other state. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a proud cosponsor of the EATS Act, which would preserve the right of state and local governments to regulate agriculture within their jurisdiction, protecting our local farmers and producers. I met with the University of Illinois System today to talk about ways we can make college more affordable & accessible in our state. Thanks for stopping in & keeping me informed of the great work you\u2019re doing for young people and those seeking continuing education opportunities! The American people deserve to trust our election process. With concerns about voter fraud growing, sadly, that faith is diminishing. Even in Washington, DC - our nation\u2019s capital - the city council said it would allow non-citizens to vote. Can you believe that? That\u2019s why I introduced legislation to ensure that only legal U.S. citizens can vote at those ballot boxes. American elections should be for the AMERICAN PEOPLE. Today marks the anniversary of the devastating Tri-State Tornado. My hometown of Murphysboro was leveled, with people killed. Hundreds more were lost across Missouri, Southern Illinois, and Indiana. Biden\u2019s failed border policies have created a humanitarian and national security crisis. After he tried taking resources away from our vets to facilitate healthcare for illegal migrants, I introduced the No VA Resources for Illegal Aliens Act to stop this practice in its tracks. As a Marine, the father of a Marine, and the grandfather of a Marine, I believe any dollar taken away from a veteran\u2019s care is a promise broken to those who served. I still hear from Southern Illinois taxpayers who are ticked off about Joe Biden\u2019s massive college loan forgiveness scheme. Why should the percent of Americans who have no student loans or paid their loans off through hard work and discipline have to pay for other\u2019s loans? A continued education is certainly a valuable thing, but with that come personal to pay for it. I voted for the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act to ensure that our daughters and granddaughters can achieve their goals on a fair playing field. Biological males should not be competing in girls\u2019 athletics. Enough of the wokeism infiltrating our schools! Tracy and I collected prayer cards for Donald Trump during his presidency. It\u2019s more important than ever that we pray for President Trump and hope we can restore real leadership back in the White House after the failures of the Biden administration. Happy St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Southern Illinois! In Illinois and across America, the liberals are fighting to crush our Second Amendment rights. I denounced Pritzker\u2019s gun grab in Illinois, fought back against Biden\u2019s pistol brace ban, and I produced legislation that is now law to protect our veterans from losing their gun rights when the VA determines they need help managing their finances. Now more than ever, we need to stand strong and protect our rights. I\u2019m fighting to put our parents back in control of their children\u2019s education. The Parents Bill of Rights Act, legislation I was proud to support and voted for when it passed the House, ensures that you have a say in what your children are learning. The legislation ensures you can review your children's classroom curriculum; review the school's budget and spending; and be heard and respected at parent-teacher conferences and public school board meetings each and every year. Enough of gender identity lessons, CRT, and wokeness that is poisoning schools! As a father and a grandfather, I\u2019m proud to have received an A+ rating from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. The fight for life is why I started in politics, and no matter what Biden and the Far-Left do in their pursuit of pro-abortion policies, I\u2019ll keep standing steadfast for the rights of the unborn. That will never change. Clay County has been awarded a million rural development grant to expand Clay County Hospital's facilities for group behavioral health services and senior care. This investment will help ensure Clay County residents are able to obtain the top quality health services they need, right in their home community. I enjoyed the discussions I had with representatives from the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee and the American Jewish Committee this week. We covered a lot of important ground, including U.S. security assistance to Israel, growing concerns about Iran, and how we can continue to foster a stronger relationship with our closest ally in the Middle East. The Illinois Corn Growers Association stopped by this week to discuss Illinois waterway infrastructure and the Farm Bill. It was great to see Don Guinnip, Garrett Hawkins, and Matt Rush - all farmers from Southern Illinois - who shared their valuable perspectives with me. I met with Reps from Mascoutah School District during their annual conference in DC. I appreciated the constructive conversation about how we can ensure that federally impacted schools, like those in Mascoutah, get the support needed to educate our next generation of leaders. Appreciate the support of in our shared fight to protect veterans\u2019 Second Amendment rights. It\u2019s a huge victory for gun rights and the U.S. Constitution! I held a meeting with the National Association of Postal Supervisors. We had a constructive discussion about ways to improve mail delivery in Southern Illinois, which is an issue many of my constituents, friends, and neighbors have reached out to our office about. I had a great discussion about the Farm Bill, pesticide regulations, and domestic fertilizer production with the Illinois Fertilizer and Chemical Association. With the agriculture industry being one of the biggest employers in Southern Illinois, we\u2019ll continue working together to make sure Southern Illinois priorities are included in the upcoming Farm Bill. Late last month, Laken Riley, a nursing student at Augusta University in Georgia, was tragically robbed of her life in a \u201ccrime of opportunity\u201d by a criminal in the United States illegally. Sadly, her death was an avoidable tragedy. Her murderer was previously charged with theft crimes in New York but was soon let loose. This week I voted for the Laken Riley Act to require that any illegal immigrants charged with crimes like theft be taken into custody. We must make America safer & close the border. Joe Biden\u2019s speech tonight was less a State of the Union than it was a State of Delusion. Biden took a victory lap for an economy the American people have no faith in and celebrated a legislative agenda that\u2019s already failed. He led off his speech asking for more money to secure Ukraine\u2019s border; but he made securing America\u2019s border his priority, soon after Snickers bars and fixing online concert ticket sales. This was Biden\u2019s last big chance to convince the American people he deserved four more years in the White House. Instead, all he offered was divisive political rhetoric, class warfare, & clear proof that he\u2019s completely out of touch with the priorities of Southern Illinois. I met with the Illinois Credit Union League to discuss their efforts to ensure clients and customers have access to the financial services they need to grow a family, buy a home, or start a small business. Appreciate the conversation. Ready for Joe Biden\u2019s fourth State of the Union tonight? With the border on fire, there\u2019s little doubt he\u2019ll have to address illegal immigration, as much as he may wish to avoid it. I predict it won\u2019t take long before he provides a couple of action items that will be too little, too late to fix the problem and then he\u2019ll look at the Republican side of the aisle and scold conservatives for his failure to act on this crisis for over three years. Biden already has the authority to close the border now. Stop worrying about saving face with the liberal base and reinstitute the tough border policies of the Trump administration. I met with Lincoln and Nancy Ervin of Effingham today as part of the Tourette Association of America\u2019s National Advocacy Day. We discussed ways we can continue to support families impacted by Tourette Syndrome and Tic Disorders. BIG NEWS: I\u2019m excited to tell you the House approved my legislation today to stop the Department of Veterans Affairs from stripping a veteran of their Second Amendment rights when they simply need help managing their finances. That tees the bill up for Senate approval this weekend as part of a larger legislative package that will soon be signed into law. For far too long, the men and women who donned the uniform to protect our constitutional rights have had their own rights violated.l If a veteran is determined to be a danger to themselves or others, let a judge make that decision \u2013 not some D.C. bureaucrat. I am thrilled to have this top priority of mine soon become law! Later this week, Biden will give his fourth State of the Union address. In his first three, he hardly mentioned the immigration crisis unfolding at our Southern Border. If anything, he\u2019s tried to gloss over it and shift blame. But the numbers don\u2019t lie: we\u2019ve had over MILLION illegal border crossings since Biden took office, and that\u2019s a direct result of his failed policies. I was proud to welcome representatives from the Fraternal Order of Police - O\u2019Fallon\u2019s Brian Gimpel, a District trustee, and Robert Nowaczyk, a national trustee \u2013 to my office to discuss issues impacting our men and women are blue. They\u2019re facing challenges like they\u2019ve never faced before, and it\u2019s import for them to know Southern Illinoisans will always have their back. To those who keep our communities safe, thank you! As one of the only former professional firefighters in Congress, it was great meeting with the Associated Fire Fighters of Illinois in my office today. I will always stand with our dedicated first responders. Thanks for all you do to keep Southern IL safe! During his State of the Union address later this week, Biden is sure to tout Bidenomics as if his policies have been a good thing for the American people. Truth is, since he took office, food prices are up & Americans are spending over more a year to buy the basics. The Left\u2019s reckless spending is causing economic damage that could take generations to recover from. We must restore fiscal sanity and reign in government spending. I\u2019m excited to announce our Congressional Art Competition! If you are a high school student or parent of a high school student who is interested in participating, please visit my website for more information. Looking forward to seeing what you create! In a BIG win for fair elections in America, the SCOTUS just UNANIMOUSLY reversed the Colorado Supreme Court\u2019s decision barring Trump from the state\u2019s ballot. The impact of this decision is far-reaching, as it ends the ridiculous attempt to remove Trump from the Illinois ballot. The highest court in the land has rightly ruled that voters should pick their next president, not an handful of activist judges. My staff will be hosting mobile office hours in Vienna on Monday, March to give you an opportunity to talk with our casework experts face-to-face about any questions you may have regarding veterans' benefits, Social Security, Medicare, the IRS, and other federal programs. We look forward to being your advocate and doing all we can to help. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to our Murphysboro office at Biden bolted to the border today in an effort to convince the American people that he\u2019s been on top of this crisis from the beginning. The facts are, under his administration, border encounters have reached record highs and migrants have been flooding into our cities. You can\u2019t sugarcoat this crisis. But Biden\u2019s trying: the White House referred to illegal immigrants as \u201cnewcomers\u201d in a briefing paper today. Newcomers? Really? Just voted NO on the short-term CR to keep Washington spending at current levels. We can't afford the status quo. I met with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency and the Illinois Municipal Utilities Association today. We discussed how we can continue working together to reinforce our energy grid and fortify our supply chains. Thanks to everyone who was able to attend! After ignoring the border crisis for years, Joe Biden is racing to Eagle Pass, Texas, this week to try to save his plummeting poll numbers. It\u2019s too late. I\u2019ve been to Eagle Pass, Texas, twice in the past year \u2013 not for photo ops and manufactured press conferences \u2013 but to meet eye-to-eye with the men and women of border patrol. They\u2019re overworked and undermanned because this administration has abandoned them. My staff will be hosting mobile office hours in Newton on Friday, March to give you an opportunity to talk with our casework experts face-to-face about any questions you may have regarding veterans\u2019 benefits, Social Security, Medicare, the IRS, and other federal programs. House and Senate conservatives are put up a united front to oppose the Biden reckless electric vehicle mandate. This push to force the Green New Deal should be a big red flag for America\u2019s consumers and commuters. It only forces us to be more reliant on foreign suppliers, especially China, for charging stations and materials. It puts our supply chain at risk. And it\u2019s just another example of Big Government restricting the rights of the people.

Nearly of households have already dipped into their retirement savings just to afford basic goods, thanks to Bidenflation. The Supreme Court ruled Biden's student loan scheme is Yet, he continues to overreach his authority to unilaterally forgive the loans of millions. It will NEVER be fair to force you to pay for someone else's loans. It\u2019s impossible to understand how the Biden admin believes allowing illegals to exploit the CBP One app & board U.S. flights with no ID benefits our country. They\u2019re clearly devoid of conscience & morality & have utterly sold America out to gain political advantage. It\u2019s evil. Climate change = eclipses and earthquakes. Who knew? Such brilliant pearls of knowledge one gets from watching The View. I didn\u2019t realize what a scientist Sunny Hostin was. Democrat cities like NYC are paying a family of four illegal aliens more money monthly than a family of four Americans that includes a military veteran receiving disability. U.S. citizens continue to take last place on the Left\u2019s list of priorities. \u201cPrices for hundreds of grocery items have increased more than since In Biden\u2019s economy, doesn\u2019t go far. Chinese foreign nationals continue to exploit our open borders. More than have illegally crossed into the U.S. since October. There were total crossings in Biden\u2019s enabling a CCP national security threat of epic proportions. Spectacular views of the total solar eclipse taken by my sons in Simms and Dripping Springs Texas, and staff in DC Are Biden's proposed radical climate change policies worth the economic hardship and nearly trillion price tag? My answer is simple: no. More Democrat hypocrisy: after years of baselessly accusing Republicans of going after Medicare, Biden is now cutting benefits and increasing costs for millions of America\u2019s seniors currently enrolled in Medicare Advantage. We should seek maximum liability from the foreign shipping companies BEFORE any congressional action. Also, Biden/Pelosi set aside trillions of taxpayer $ on \u201cclimate\u201d and projects in and - if federal $ must be spent, it should come from that pot. Today, our heartfelt prayers are with all of the Americans who've lost a spouse in defense of our nation. May their ultimate sacrifice never be forgotten, nor those made by our Gold Star spouses. So - President Trump is prohibited from defending himself due to a gag order while the judge\u2019s daughter profits financially?! I don\u2019t think so. \u2019s right - this NY judge should immediately recuse himself from the case. Terrorists are exploiting Biden\u2019s open borders to sneak into the country. We don\u2019t know how many, but they\u2019re here - and that should send shivers down the spine of every American. \u201c\u2026the Israel Defense Forces uncovered large caches of Chinese-made weapons, gear and other military supplies during raids in Gaza.\u201d The CCP is actively supporting America\u2019s enemies. Biden depleted our SPR to a record low without a single thought about the consequences. Now he\u2019s canceling planned purchases to replenish the SPR he drained. This president puts American energy LAST. Nothing to see here - just Big Brother working with Big Tech to silence your voice. The Left\u2019s on a quest to turn America into an Orwellian dystopian nightmare. The facts prove that walls work to mitigate illegal immigration. We need to finish the southern border wall NOW! Texas shrimpers are being crushed by cheap foreign imports that often violate U.S. health standards. I will continue working to safeguard our state\u2019s shrimping industry and to ensure that our anti-dumping laws are enforced by this administration! Let\u2019s be clear: Mexico should NEVER dictate American policy. I couldn\u2019t agree with President Trump more - not another DIME! From my family to yours \u2013 Happy Easter. Today, may we reflect on God\u2019s unconditional love as we gather to celebrate the resurrection of His one and only son, Jesus Christ. I pray you have a blessed day surrounded by those you love most. He is risen! Biden has chosen the Left\u2019s extreme transgender agenda over Easter - a day commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This never-ending wokeness is beyond sickening. House Republicans kept their word and held Sec. Mayorkas accountable for his deliberate negligence at the southern border. It\u2019s time for the Senate to do the same! President Biden clearly can\u2019t stand American truckers. His new EPA regulations are yet another Democrat Green New Deal mandate that will crush mom-and-pop businesses and increase prices along the entire supply chain. \u201cIn recent years, thousands of Texas cattle have been slaughtered after being infected with drug-resistant TB through contact with illegal aliens who end up working in dairies\u2026\u201d One more reason to stop the mass release of illegals and secure our borders! The White House banned religious Easter egg submissions\u2026 You can\u2019t make this stuff up. It\u2019s shameful! The fact that the Biden administration did not stand with Israel and veto this ceasefire resolution is further proof that the radical Left is in full control of this White House. \u201cThe Food and Drug Administration has agreed to remove all social media posts urging people to avoid the use of ivermectin for treatment.\u201d Where was Biden\u2019s misinformation police when the FDA was spreading lies? Biden\u2019s anti-oil and gas agenda is hurting America. Last week, House Republicans passed several bills that work to unleash our domestic sector and restore U.S. energy independence! Thankful for our men and women in blue and the lives they heroically save daily! #BackTheBlue The Left wants zero interior enforcement - just endless incentivization of illegal immigration. A no-bid MILLION contract that hands illegal aliens prepaid credit cards and American citizens nothing. What a shame. I voted NO on last week\u2019s spending bill. I\u2019m also a NO on the proposed motion to vacate . Right now, House Republicans should push forward united behind our Speaker and in our mission to ensure the Left\u2019s radical agenda FAILS. The deportation of around illegal aliens did NOT happen because Biden's disastrous DHS failed to file the correct paperwork. How convenient... and deliberate. This administration is actively trying to replace American voters. Happy Birthday to this American hero! Americans don\u2019t want costly vehicles they can\u2019t rely on. Taking away consumer choice and forcing folks to buy EVs is wrong and will do NOTHING to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the end. What it will do is embolden Communist China. \"American drivers pay percent more to fuel their daily commutes since President Joe Biden ascended to the White House...\u201d Fossil fuels are the only reliable energy source. Bring back U.S. energy independence! My bill, the \u201cASTRO Act,\u201d ensures U.S. astronauts have the tools they need to get back on their feet once they return to Earth. Proud to play a role in our astronauts\u2019 recovery effort here at home. Biden\u2019s border crisis is the biggest national security breach since This administration is refusing to uphold its oath to protect the homeland - states like Texas must continue to step in. The Biden admin\u2019s been using the CBP One app to sneak monthly \u201cCHNV\u201d parolees into the U.S. This Haitian - charged w/ raping a disabled girl - was one such parolee. It\u2019s time to CLOSE the border, END this program, & DEPORT, DEPORT, DEPORT! Why doesn\u2019t the Left care about the fact that this admin has LOST over migrant children it released to unvetted sponsors in the U.S.? I\u2019m demanding answers on the White House\u2019s lax policies enabling human traffickers to exploit vulnerable children. Yesterday, over illegal aliens stormed the southern border in El Paso, Texas. This cannot stand. CLOSE the border NOW! Great visiting with astronauts Stephen Bowen, , & , as well as Frank Rubio, who holds a record days aboard the ISS. The work they & our international partners do to advance is vital to continued U.S. leadership in space. Make no mistake: an invasion is taking place in Texas, and the Biden administration is ignoring it. Texas has the constitutional right to defend itself and its citizens and should respond to this with the appropriate force to stop it. BILL ALERTI\u2019ve introduced the \u201cRemain in Canada Act\u201d to combat the border crisis & stop the surging crossings at our NORTHERN border. My bill applies Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy to the U.S.-Canada border, providing vital tools to end the flow of illegals into America. Liberals ignore the fact that EV lithium batteries - mostly made by China - result in more carbon dioxide emissions than the production of gas-powered cars. If the Left truly cared about climate change, why increase US dependency on Beijing - the top global polluter? \"An impeachment witness claimed on Wednesday that President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden and brother Jim Biden perjured themselves...\" House Republicans must continue the search for the truth among the expanding sea of lies by the Biden Crime Family. A self-identified Hezbollah terrorist was caught on his way to attempt an attack in New York. He entered America through Biden\u2019s open southern border. How many other terrorists made it in and are actively planning attacks on our homeland? Deeply saddened by the passing of my friend/mentor, US astronaut Lt. Gen. Tom Stafford. Tom was an aviation giant who served a vital role in the success of our space exploration efforts & advancing our USAF dominance. He was a hero whose bright mind & legacy will be remembered. Surprise, surprise - Google has interfered in major U.S. elections since The power and control that this organization possesses over information should be looked into immediately. Clearly, the Veterans Affairs\u2019 DEI office is doing everything BUT help our veterans. This is what happens when wokeness reigns over common sense, decency, and the real goal of the mission. We can\u2019t just blindly fund failed states. The U.S. has sent BILLION to Haiti since - and the country is once again in a state of upheaval. Simply sending more taxpayer dollars to Haiti won\u2019t solve any problems. China\u2019s continual purchase of U.S. agricultural land must be stopped. We cannot allow Beijing to jeopardize our food and national security. The chaos occurring in Haiti is concerning, but it must not be allowed to come to our shores via a seaborne migration crisis. We cannot afford any more unvetted illegals being blindly released into the interior of the nation. Instead of securing our borders or our own elections, Senate Democrat \u201cLeader\u201d Chuck Schumer is now plotting to overthrow Israel\u2019s duly elected prime minister while they\u2019re waging war on Hamas terrorists. Disgraceful - he should resign! Gas prices are once again on the rise - the intended consequence of a president working tirelessly to cripple U.S. oil and gas and push EVs. Pregnancy Resource Centers are a vital lifeline to so many expecting mothers - \u2019s Op-Ed does a great job reminding us of that fact. I will continue to fight Biden and the Left\u2019s relentless attempts to cut funding to them. \"We identified evidence that the President [Biden] willfully retained classified materials after the end of his vice presidency, when he was a private citizen.\" - former Special Counsel Robert Hur Joe Biden was NOT exonerated. America\u2019s treasury is not limitless. Check out Biden\u2019s TRILLION Fiscal Year budget proposal compared to the GOP\u2019s below Today, the House acted to protect the American people from being targeted, surveilled, or influenced by the CCP. TikTok: time to break up with Beijing. The Left\u2019s not only pushing minors to change or ruin their bodies permanently - they\u2019re working to ensure parents have ZERO say in it or any legal recourse. It\u2019s wrong, and I won\u2019t stand for it. This morning's successful splashdown of the Crew Dragon spacecraft Endurance marked the end of a mission on the ISS. Welcome home, Higher rates and denied loans are the reality Americans now face under Bidenomics. \u201cThe United States is expected to be grappling with more than million asylum seekers and migrants who will have crossed over the southern border by September.\u201d The vulnerabilities that Biden has deliberately subjected us to should scare every American. A new report alleges the Committee hid evidence confirming that Donald Trump requested National Guard assistance before Further proof that this partisan committee was a total farce. President Biden, impeached DHS Sec. Mayorkas, & other admin cronies are exploiting the CBP One app & every loophole in existence to sneak unvetted illegals into the nation by the hundreds of thousands. I\u2019m demanding answers & an end to this recklessness! Biden is destroying America via his border crisis. We cannot afford to let him finish the job. Laken Riley was slain by a CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIEN who was allowed to roam free thanks to Biden\u2019s policies. On Thursday, I voted to ensure ICE detains illegals charged with theft/burglary and grant states the right to legal action. \"...average monthly payments on a new home soared to in the third quarter of this year, marking a staggering increase since late Biden took office.\" Americans' dreams of owning a home are becoming just that - dreams. Biden\u2019s incompetent leadership has made our nation weaker on all fronts. Make no mistake: Americans were better off under Donald Trump. Biden\u2019s doing everything possible to ensure we suffer another horrific terrorist attack on U.S. soil. This president goes out of his way to unravel our national security. My thoughts on tonight's #SOTU: Hunter Biden CONFIRMED before Congress that he received MILLIONS in CCP funds and his father, while VP, had attended multiple dinners with his business associates. Americans deserve to know if their president is beholden to foreign Biden\u2019s admin says he doesn\u2019t need a cognitive test, but his countless gaffes prove otherwise. More Americans lose confidence in the president\u2019s mental capabilities daily. He should take a cognitive test immediately. We\u2019ll see another or worse because of Joe Biden\u2019s deliberate border crisis. Congratulations to and on the successful launch of The astronauts safely docked at the this morning and are set to begin their critical work that will continue propelling our space program upward and outward! A common-sense law and huge win for election integrity! Voting in U.S. elections is sacred right that should ONLY be afforded to American citizens. In vitro fertilization is a blessing for many parents who struggle with fertility. I support states ensuring this treatment is available for families while still protecting the dignity and value of the precious children born from it. The Supreme Court reached a UNANIMOUS decision in favor of Donald Trump in the Colorado ballot dispute. Those attempting to stop Trump from running should take notice! \u201cA federal appeals court panel ruled Friday that Jan. defendants\u2026 had their sentences improperly lengthened by judges\u2026\u201d This is further proof of the biased and warped justice that\u2019s been applied to prisoners. First gas stoves, now washers and dryers! Biden\u2019s radical climate agenda strikes again, but the victim is still the same: the American people. The Left won\u2019t stop until they fully implement their illogical Green New Deal policies! Thanks to Ellington Field and the for the update and mission brief last week. This base plays a vital role in our national security - it\u2019s a privilege to represent it! Becoming a homeowner has been a key element of the American Dream for generations.

I voted NO on reauthorizing Section of #FISA because your government should SERVE YOU, not spy on you. #GetAWarrant Joe Biden wants to give BILLION of YOUR TAX MONEY to bail out woke college students that can't get a real job. It is unfair to force hundreds of millions of Americans who chose not to attend college to foot the bill for those who did and don't want to pay. This is insane. An Afghan national on the FBI terror watchlist was arrested crossing the southern border and then released into the United States. Joe Biden can\u2019t even bother to pretend like he cares about border security or the safety of Americans. This should come as a shock to no one, but Iran is threatening Israel because they smell weakness from the Biden administration. Iran wants escalation because they fear no consequences. Until this changes, the U.S. and our allies can only expect more aggression from Iran. What Israel really needs is for Biden to stop criticizing while they are fighting for their lives. Honored to hear Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida address Congress today. Japan is one of our strongest allies within Asia and I\u2019m committed to strengthening that relationship. If Congress wants to send aid to Ukraine, Israel or Taiwan, let\u2019s debate and vote on them individually. We owe the American people due diligence. Criminals and sex offenders are welcomed into our country with open arms by the Biden Administration. Joe Biden refuses to address his broken border policies and it\u2019s putting our families at risk. NOT ONE PENNY of your tax money should go to the terrorists that carried out the deadliest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. A bill is worth less than it did back when Joe Biden took office in January Joe Biden\u2019s tax and spend policies are putting the American Dream out of reach. Joe Biden is ready to throw Israel overboard for a couple of \u201cuncommitted\u201d votes in Dearborn, Michigan. We need a foreign policy that puts America\u2019s security over ballot box politics. A lunatic radicalized by ISIS was just arrested for threatening to attack churchgoers in Idaho. This is what happens when our children are indoctrinated with anti-American sentiment. A month ago, Joe Biden announced plans to build a port in Gaza to help advance aid. Now, it\u2019s clear this administration still has no idea how to prevent that aid from going into the hands of TERRORISTS. Lloyd Austin just told a congressional committee that much himself. At a time when anti-semitism is on the rise all across the world, it is important that America stands with the Jewish people and their homeland. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet and talk with the members of and reiterate our support for Israel. I\u2019m proud to see that Port St. Lucie is recognizing so many brave men and women who served their country. Joe Biden keeps trying to find new ways to use billions of YOUR tax dollars to bailout people with student loans. Why should an electrician who opted to pursue trade school be forced to foot the bill for the Yale gender-studies graduate making coffee at Starbucks? Did you miss today\u2019s eclipse? The next solar eclipse in America will take place over the Sunshine State in What a surprise: the Palestinian Authority is quickly filling up with antisemitic extremists who deny Israel\u2019s right to exist. And these are supposed to be Biden\u2019s \u201cpartners in peace.\u201d Joe Biden and his WOKE flunkies tried to\u2026 Stop President Trump from building the wall. Stop from protecting the border, when Mayorkas would not. Send more illegal migrants to Florida than to any other state. All of these look deliberate to me. It\u2019s been months since Hamas butchered innocent men, women, and children. Oct. was deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. That nightmare has been unending for many, including the hostages still held by Hamas. We pray for their release & Israel\u2019s victory. Imagine somebody\u2019s slapping you every day and they stop. You don\u2019t thank them because they stopped slapping you. While I'm happy that the Corps listened and stopped the discharges. #NoDischarges should always be the expectation. The Army Corps must create a plan to cease all harmful discharges to our estuaries in accordance with the Northern Estuaries Restoration Plan. We cannot allow the rogue Army Corps to cause us to endure another #LostSummer. This is what happens when Joe Biden rewards terrorists for terrorism. It's incredible to see this leatherback sea turtle make its way back to Juno Beach to nest. This is just one more reason why we need to fight year-round for access to clean water! TOXIC discharges from Lake Okeechobee into the St. Lucie River are a massive public health threat. The current management plan is over a decade old and uses outdated, debunked science. We finally have an update on the new Lake Okeechobee System Operating Manual. FIX AMERICA\u2019S BROKEN BORDER POLICY. Our government\u2019s top priority should be to fix the border! We do NOT deserve to have TOXIC water dumped in our backyard. After I urged the Army Corps to cease discharges, they announced a halt in discharges from Lake Okeechobee into the St. Lucie River. While this is a win, we need a long-term solution. I'll keep fighting for\u2026 The Army Corps has gone rogue. I wrote the Northern Estuaries Restoration Plan to require the Army Corps to develop additional infrastructure to stop all harmful discharges to the northern estuaries. They are now refusing to lift a finger to fix this problem they created, so we\u2026 Joe Biden is out of his mind if he thinks he can take the Houthis off the TERROR list without serious consequences. The Houthis continue to attack ships in the Red Sea threatening the global supply chain. Biden is trying to appease far-left LUNATICS by demanding Israel accept a ceasefire with TERRORISTS. Yet again, Biden is putting lives at risk in a desperate attempt to boost his poll numbers. We cannot abandon our best ALLY in the Middle East. TOXIC discharges from Lake Okeechobee are destroying the St. Lucie estuary. You can see this as clear as day in this before and after. How much more DAMAGE does the Army Corps of Engineers have to inflict upon our community? #ZeroDischarges Happy birthday, Maverick. You live up to your name all day everyday, and we could not be more proud of you! Joe Biden likes to PRETEND he\u2019s a working-class guy, but he\u2019s proposing tax hikes that will kill good-paying jobs and DECIMATE our economy. How does that line up? Biden is pathetically out of touch with real Americans. Brianna and I are praying for Florida Senate President Kathleen Passidomo and her entire family. We hope John\u2019s memory will be a comfort to them in this difficult time. U.S. tax dollars should NEVER be used to torture innocent animals, especially puppies and kittens. That's why I\u2019m proud to have passed legislation prohibiting tax dollars meant for veterans from going toward cruel animal testing experiments. Joe Biden had the choice to finish the job President Trump started and make America energy independent. Instead, he cut pipelines here in the United States while funding pipelines abroad. With the skyrocketing gas prices, Americans are paying for his MORONIC decisions. BREAKINGAnother health alert for Martin County. Toxic blue-green algae confirmed in additional spots in the St. Lucie River. This is a public health threat. Nothing but #ZeroDischarges is acceptable. I had the honor and privilege of speaking to Junior ROTC cadets at St. Lucie West Centennial High School. I was heartened by their commitment and desire to serve our nation. I have no doubt this is the next generation of heroes! TOXIC algae is already covering about of Lake Okeechobee. Yet, the Army Corps of Engineers wants to keep dumping this POLLUTION into our estuaries. This is UNACCEPTABLE. I will continue to fight until we have #ZeroDischarges into the St. Lucie estuary. Biden INSULTED millions of Christians by rejecting Easter in favor of a made-up holiday celebrating gender dysphoria. Now he\u2019s gaslighting us, pretending he never did it. It\u2019s disgusting how little he thinks of Americans. Does your wallet feel emptier after Easter? You\u2019re not alone. Under Biden, eggs alone cost more. Hardworking families can\u2019t afford this administration. BEWARE of toxic algae in the St. Lucie River. This algae is undeniably dangerous to the health and safety of our families and pets. I\u2019m demanding a long-term HALT to the Army Corps poisonous discharges. Joe Biden REVERSED of President Trump\u2019s BORDER policies and guess what happened? ILLEGAL immigration surged by and innocent Americans like Laken Riley lost their lives. It\u2019s past time we SECURED the border. I confronted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers about the pollution they\u2019ve been discharging from Lake Okeechobee into the St. Lucie Estuary. What I got in response was a \u201cpolitician\u2019s answer.\u201d Brianna and I wish you all a joyful and peaceful Easter! Take today to reflect on the blessings in your life. Happy Easter from my family to yours! What DEI hire convinced Biden to celebrate gender dysphoria instead of Easter and our risen savior? Probably, the same WOKE flunky that advised no religion at the White House Easter Egg hunt. When you open the news and see headlines like these: Unemployment is up Illegal immigration is up Gas prices to hit by summer It\u2019s no surprise the White House doesn\u2019t talk about #Bidenomics anymore. Our GOVERNMENT has broken its oath to do no harm. The Army Corps of Engineers is the biggest POLLUTER on the Treasure Coast. The TOXIC algae found in Martin County is TWO times the level safe for human contact. I won\u2019t sit silent as our community is POISONED. #ZeroDischarges WARNING TOXIC algae that is more than TWO times the level safe for human contact has been found in Martin County thanks to discharges the Army Corps of Engineers has dumped into our community. They MUST stop discharging now. Lives are being put at risk! #ZeroDischarges Under Joe Biden, Americans always come last. Here\u2019s the ABC of Joe Biden\u2019s failures: F is for Foreign Affairs. Joe Biden has made the world less safe for average Americans. From terrorist attacks against Israel to abandoned allies in Afghanistan, America\u2019s standing across the world has plummeted under Biden. G is for Go. Under Joe Biden, Americans always come last. JOE MUST GO. E is for the Energy Crisis. Joe Biden has abandoned energy independence. As a result, gas prices are on the rise and slated to hit by the summer. Our government, unfortunately, is the biggest polluter of our community. The United States Army Corps of Engineer\u2019s policy should be DO NO HARM. I will continue to fight in Congress to stop these toxic discharges. Palestinian TERRORISTS tried to shoot up a school bus along a major highway in the West Bank. These MONSTERS do not care about hurting innocent CHILDREN. But please tell me more about the need for a CEASEFIRE with these TERRORISTS. Our team is receiving reports of blue-green algae present along the St. Lucie River. If you spot an algal bloom make sure to submit a report with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection: the meantime, I'm urging the Army Corps to cease\u2026 Happy Manatee Appreciation Day! Manatees are the canary in the coal mine: When our water is poisoned, seagrass dies and manatees starve. We will continue to fight for clean water and #ZeroDischarges to save our ecosystem. ALERT: There is blue-green algae in the canal and the St. Lucie River.This is a public health emergency and a threat to our entire ecosystem. The Army Corps thinks a two week \u201cpause\u201d is enough of a break from dumping toxins into our community. It\u2019s not. I\u2019m demanding\u2026 The Bottom Line: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is dumping toxic water from Lake Okeechobee into our backyards. We\u2019ve gone from water that was Bahama blue to water that you can\u2019t even see your hands in anymore. A two-week \u201cpause\u201d in toxic discharges is a slap in the face to\u2026 Last week, I voted NO on the trillion spending package. With a trillion national debt, we cannot saddle our children with the bill. I will continue to fight to protect YOUR tax money and make sure it is not used to fund idiotic ideas. Joe Biden\u2019s new AMNESTY plan reportedly includes handing out green cards to ILLEGAL ALIENS that have overstayed in the U.S. by YEARS if they know someone who will suffer because of their deportation. You can\u2019t make this stuff up. Joe Biden tried to APPEASE far-left activists by letting the United Nations pass a \u201cceasefire\u201d resolution that makes NO MENTION of Hamas. What followed was predictable. Hamas terrorists REJECTED a deal to free hostages and began firing even more rockets at Israeli civilians.\u2026 It was my pleasure to speak at the West Palm Beach Leadership Summit today. Thank you, and for hosting this great event! National Medal of Honor Day presents an opportunity for us to recognize the brave men and women who selflessly put their lives on the line. Their sacrifices have helped build America. Israel is willing to trade more than imprisoned TERRORISTS to secure the release of innocent women and children being held hostage by Hamas. It\u2019s obvious who the good guys are here: Israel wants to save lives, Hamas wants to destroy them. Did you know that the Biden Administration is sending HALF A MILLION DOLLARS of your tax dollars to promote atheism in Nepal? When I asked about it, they lied and said it didn\u2019t happen. Then I showed them the receipts. Check it out: The top two generals who oversaw the Afghanistan withdrawal confirmed what we already knew: Joe Biden ignored their and Americans lost their lives. The threat to Americans safety is at an all time high. Joe Biden is only worried about himself, and he\u2019s ignoring the very real border crisis as a result. When I\u2019m up in Washington, D.C., it\u2019s always great to see some familiar faces of the Treasure Coast. I had the opportunity to say a quick hi to students from the All About Achieving Learning Centers from Stuart, Florida. If you are visiting our nation\u2019s capital, let us know! Algae is already covering of Lake Okeechobee, and it\u2019s only March. Discharges are already having detrimental effects on our estuary, and it\u2019s only March. I\u2019m urging the Army Corps to cease discharges immediately. Our community is not their septic tank! They will try to spin the truth, but the reality is that Joe Biden executed the Afghanistan withdrawal exactly how he wanted, and as a result, we have more Gold Star families. REMINDER: The only people arrested for Joe Biden's failed Afghanistan withdrawal were Lt. Col. Stu Scheller and Gold Star father Steve Nikoui. Their crime? Speaking out against Joe Biden. Washington D.C. politicians and bureaucrats were at it again this week, lying to the American people while spending your tax dollars. Check out the latest #WeekInReview as I demand answers and accountability: This is unacceptable, especially at a VA facility that should be doing everything to help those who committed their lives to protecting our nation. That is why , and I are demanding new leadership is put in place to solve these perpetual issues. I voted NO on the funding package today. This trillion bill is pages long, and it lumps COUNTLESS absurd projects into one massive package. Politicians in Washington, D.C. are hoping the American people won't notice it\u2019s a massive waste of YOUR tax dollars. The Army Corps is continuing to kill our waterways with polluted water from Lake Okeechobee. The water being dumped on us contains unmonitored levels of contamination with the right combination of phosphorus and nitrogen to light the St. Lucie on fire with algal blooms when the\u2026 I\u2019m leading the entire Florida delegation to urge the House and Senate Committees on Veterans\u2019 Affairs to quickly consider legislation to designate the VA medical center in West Palm Beach as the \u201cThomas H. Corey Health Care System of West Palm Beach.\u201d Read more about this\u2026 The Biden Administration spent HALF A MILLION DOLLARS of your money to promote atheism in Nepal. Then, they came to Congress to lie about it. They just got BUSTED in real time. The State Department is hiding the truth from the American people and refusing to answer basic questions about their use of taxpayer dollars. LIVE NOW: I am chairing a hearing to demand transparency. Enough excuses. The American people deserve answers. Joe Biden is now demanding to see Israel\u2019s military plans. Maybe the lives lost at Abbey Gate would still be alive if he\u2019d spent a little more time focused on his own military plans. WATCH: This crazy exchange is a couple years old but still remains true today. America is BLESSED with abundant resources from sea to shining sea, but Joe Biden's policies have left us and our allies to depend on adversaries and dictators for energy. That's why the House voted\u2026 A dollar for UNRWA is a dollar for Hamas ICYMI: I talked with Fox News about what I want to hear from the generals who oversaw the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. As the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Accountability, I promise you: the fight for accountability is not over. Joe Biden can secure the border if he chooses, but since he won\u2019t, patriotic Americans will: The House passed the Secure the Border Act, Texas passed it\u2019s own strict border security bill, And the Supreme Court just cleared the way for that bill to go into effect. This\u2026 WATCH NOW: Joe Biden gave aid and comfort to terrorists. Americans died as a result. Here\u2019s the proof: Joe Biden\u2019s failed withdrawal from Afghanistan killed U.S. servicemembers at the Abbey Gate. Today, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will demand the TRUTH from top U.S. generals who oversaw the deadly withdrawal. Florida\u2019s coastline extends miles more than the Texas-Mexico border. We must secure every mile of the border, whether it\u2019s land or coastline. Our waterways are under attack. The Army Corps has held Lake Okeechobee artificially high and is now flushing their poor decisions into our backyards. Make no mistake: the Corps has the ability to change this poor strategy but is choosing not to. Check out the latest episode of\u2026 There is no room for anti-Semitism in this world. As long as I am in Congress, I will ensure that the U.S. stands with our ally, Israel, and the Jewish people. I was honored to receive the Dr. Bob Shillman Zionism Award from the Zionist Organization of America on Sunday night. Mr. Smith, thank you for your service and sacrifice to America. If you are a Veteran who needs medical or mental health services, my team is here to help you with any VA needs. Give us a call at This could have been AVOIDEDIf the Army Corps did not hold the lake artificially high in the dry season, we would not be receiving DAMAGING discharges right now. Our community is suffering and our estuaries are being decimated. I will continue to FIGHT days a year\u2026 We know Joe likes his ice cream, but shouldn\u2019t the Biden Administration use their resources on something a little more important? The future of our country depends on young men and women like these students at Jupiter Christian Academy. If there is anything I hope they took away from the trip to Washington, D.C., it is that there is joy in serving our community and country. We know what happens when the U.S. Army Corps flushes toxic water into our estuaries. This is why bills like my Northern Estuaries Restoration Plan are crucial to ending all discharges. The Army Corps must follow this law! The Chinese Communist Party - which bans American apps from China - says a potential TikTok ban would \u201ccome back to bite the United States.\u201d I say bring it on. The Biden Administration has an obligation to protect and defend the American people from all threats. Right now, they\u2019re not succeeding. Watch the latest #WeekInReview: individuals on the terrorist watchlist have been apprehended while attempting to enter our country THIS YEAR. This week, the FBI confirmed what we already knew: Joe Biden can secure the border if he wants, but he REFUSES to do so. Hey , do you know where we stand with terrorists? We stand on their throats. As the only Member of Congress who has worn the uniform of both the U.S. Army and the Israeli Defense Forces, I know that those on the ground are willing to give their last breath for their country and for their friends, family, and neighbors. My prayers are with them.", "Strengthening our economy Strengthening our national security Proud to have worked across the aisle with on a bipartisan supply chains package that passed today.

My Jobs Agenda aims to strengthen our manufacturing sector, address supply chain issues, expand access to affordable housing, and provide second chances to individuals. We will reduce barriers to entering the workforce so that all Delawareans can succeed. In addition to calling for the passage of these bills, I have been hard at work advocating for these issues.

His commitment to public service resulted in a year career where he was a champion for working families. Sending prayers to his family, friends, & all who knew him. I\u2019m appalled that the historic St. Daniel's Community Church of Iron Hill was vandalized with racist, offensive, & threatening language. Houses of worship should be safe havens. I wholeheartedly condemn this act of hate & believe those responsible should be held accountable. Affordable child care isn't a nice-to-have - it's a must-have, especially for working families. Proud to have secured million in Community Project Funding w/ & for critical renovations at St. Michael's School & Nursery in Wilmington's East Side.

Democrats are willing to trade working families\u2019 livelihoods for kudos from their radical base. The remainder of government funding for FY is on a path to becoming law. As bill text is finalized, I\u2019m grateful to Senator Collins for pushing tirelessly for Republican priorities, including urgent resources for national defense. It's time for Congress to complete our work. I was proud to welcome Polish President to the U.S. Capitol. Poland's generous support for Ukraine is a model for allies. In the face of historic threats, America is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with such a stalwart member of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Law enforcement and Jewish groups nationwide are sounding the alarm on \u2019 attempt to give life tenure on the federal bench to a nominee with ties to terrorist sympathizers and cop-killers. The Senate must reject Adeel Mangi\u2019s nomination. .\u2019 latest budget request would raise taxes as a share of GDP to their highest level since WWII. Meanwhile, the same measure of spending on national defense is near historic lows. It\u2019s a dangerous world, and a who\u2019s proposed net cuts to defense funding\u2026 Last week, the Senate\u2019s action on government funding delivered on Kentucky\u2019s top priorities \u2013 from military construction to overhauling aging roads and bridges and empowering law enforcement to combat the opioid crisis. I\u2019m proud we took action on issues near and dear to my\u2026 Last night, spoke directly to the American people and presented a stark contrast. After three years of \u2019 failures, she showed how Republicans are ready to turn the page and preserve the American Dream for the next generation. Proud to welcome Kristersson to the U.S. Capitol and his nation to the most successful military alliance in history. Like Finland, Sweden's capable forces and modern defense industrial base will enhance and strengthen America's own national security from Day One. Glad to announce with that will deliver the Republican address to the nation next Thursday. The American people will hear from an unapologetic optimist fighting to secure a stronger future and leave Washington Democrats\u2019 failures behind. As I said on the Senate floor, one of life\u2019s most talents is to know when it\u2019s time to move on. It\u2019s been the honor of my life to serve as Republican leader. Strengthening NATO means strengthening U.S. national security and the collective security of the West. The United States and the entire alliance will be proud to formally welcome Sweden to our ranks this year. My full statement: The Senate understands the of America\u2019s national security and will not neglect them. And today, on the value of American leadership and strength, history will record that the Senate did not blink. My full statement: The choice facing the Senate is simple: Will we recommit to the American strength our allies crave and our adversaries fear? Or will we give those who wish us harm one more reason to question our resolve? We cannot afford to get this wrong. Read my full remarks:\u2026 My statement on the supplemental national security legislation: My thoughts remain with Kentucky\u2019s Field Artillery Brigade, and with the Kentuckian injured in Saturday\u2019s deadly attack on U.S. personnel in Jordan.

Bobbi\u2019s home state is better for her decades of devoted advocacy for a host of worthy causes. Today, the Senate holds John, her daughter Hadley, and the entire Barrasso and Brown families in our prayers. My\u2026 .\u2019 deference to climate extremists continues to sell out American consumers and U.S. allies. Greater reliance on dirty energy from Russia or Iran is never in the national interest. When our allies and partners face aggression, America is not inoculated from the effects. When authoritarians think they can redraw maps by force, American national security is challenged. The Senate must be ready to invest in American leadership and American strength. The goals of supplemental national security legislation are secure our southern border, help fight Putin\u2019s aggression in Europe, invest seriously in competition with China, and stand with Israel and restore real deterrence against Iran. Keeping America safe.\u2026 Today, tens of thousands of supporters will take to Washington to celebrate the sanctity of human life. I am proud of the Kentuckians and all Americans who are standing for human dignity at this year\u2019s #MarchForLife. The Biden Administration still thinks it can convince working families to ignore their shrinking paychecks and believe that Bidenomics is working. But just of Americans think ' policies are actually helping them. Truth is, Bidenomics is a dud. Iran and its proxies don't believe America has the resolve to impose serious costs for their increasing terrorist violence. We can\u2019t hope to deter aggression with weakness. Our adversaries speak the language of strength. And America can\u2019t afford not to be fluent. From day one, the Biden Administration met Iranian aggression with accommodation and squandered the credibility of American deterrence. It\u2019s time for to explain how exactly he intends to compel Iran and its proxies to change their behavior. Israel takes extraordinary risks to minimize civilian casualties. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad go to extraordinary lengths to maximize senseless death. We must not confuse one for the other. The Senate should reject the Sanders resolution. Today we celebrate the life and legacy of a monumental American, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King\u2019s simple and powerful message still echoes across our country, inspiring Americans of all walks of life to keep striving towards a more perfect union. I welcome U.S. and coalition operations against the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for disrupting international commerce and attacking American vessels. My full statement: From the border crisis to the Red Sea, none of the national security challenges we face will get any easier the longer we wait to address them. We\u2019re facing a clear test of America\u2019s credibility as a global superpower. The Senate must not fail. Read my full remarks:\u2026 America is facing the most serious array of national security challenges since the fall of the Soviet Union \u2013 border crisis, rampant terrorism, strategic competition, and land war in Europe. The Biden playbook has been hesitation and But the\u2026 For too long, the Ivy League let leftist dogmas replace the free exchange of ideas. But across the country, places like Kentucky's leading universities continue to champion integrity and academic rigor. It\u2019s time for the Ivy League to start pursuing truth again.\u2026 Three years of American retreat have left the world\u2019s most active state sponsor of terror undeterred. The best way America can help allies like Israel is to lead with strength and restore credible deterrence against Iranian aggression. I\u2019m encouraged that the Speaker and Democratic Leaders have identified a path toward completing FY appropriations. America faces serious national security challenges, and Congress must act quickly to deliver the full-year resources this moment requires. Today, I want to wish my fellow Kentuckians and all Americans a very Merry Christmas. As a weary world rejoices, I\u2019m especially grateful to our nation\u2019s brave servicemembers who are serving away from home and loved ones to keep America safe. Yesterday, I was honored to join Rabbi Levi Shemtov for the inaugural Capitol Menorah Lighting. This year, the Hanukkah message of light in darkness is especially needed. I am proud to celebrate the Jewish people\u2019s resilience, and will continue to stand up for their right to\u2026 .\u2019 latest judicial nominee, Adeel Mangi, served on the board of a law school organization that amplifies anti-Semitic terrorist propaganda. As Jews face an historic wave of anti-Semitic hate, this is the kind of nominee the Biden Administration wants us to confirm? The choice facing elite universities today is clear: enforce existing speech restrictions evenly, or protect speech across the board \u2013 not just for anti-Semitic radicals. In the meantime, donors will continue to vote with their checkbooks, and students may vote with their feet. When it comes to keeping America safe, border security is not a side show. It\u2019s a main event. More and more Democrats are recognizing this reality. It\u2019s time for their leaders to act on it. Tonight, Jews around the world will light the first candle of Hanukkah. Let us join in celebrating the resiliency and strength of the Jewish people and stand up for their right to live free from fear. The Biden southern border crisis is out of control. America\u2019s national security begins with securing our nation\u2019s borders. And supplemental legislation must begin there, too. The Senate is about to vote on a resolution that would withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, reward Iran, and wreck America\u2019s credibility in the Middle East. A vote for this resolution would be a vote for retreat in the face of terror. Read my full remarks: Border security is national security. Supplemental national security legislation must include meaningful policy changes to get the Biden border crisis under control. Not enough Senate Democrats recognize this fundamental and urgent reality. .\u2019s neighbors in Bakersfield were fortunate to have such an optimistic doer represent them for years. I am proud of the work we accomplished together in the Capitol, and I wish him the very best as he writes a new chapter. Senate Republicans have been crystal clear: national security starts with border security. The sooner Democrats realize this, the sooner we can deliver on urgent national security priorities. National security begins with border security. That\u2019s why Senate Republicans are still hard at work on policy changes to fix our broken asylum and parole system and get the Biden border crisis under control. It\u2019s time for Democrats to get back to work producing\u2026 Today, our nation mourns the passing of a towering figure in the history of American law. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor led with brilliance and conviction. Elaine and I send our deepest condolences to the entire O\u2019Connor family. The Senate is about to vote on a resolution that would withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, reward Iran, and wreck America\u2019s credibility in the Middle East. A vote for this resolution would be a vote for retreat in the face of terror.

The Republican IVF ban is a war on families. These MAGA policies not only target women and families but now are especially attacking the freedoms that so many of our nation\u2019s veterans fought to protect. We can\u2019t take these attacks on reproductive health lightly. We must believe\u2026 Here you go #DimelessDonRT for those who think he\u2019s rich! Creeper alert! MAGA GOP want on-demand gender checks for kids in sports. I called them out. This is a remarkable data point. And the nominee \u2014 the late John McCain \u2014 certainly didn\u2019t support him. Health care is a kitchen table issue most Americans are faced with everyday. That\u2019s why I applaud for taking action to reduce costs by capping the price of inhalers at I\u2019m proud to represent one of Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s facilities in Fremont, California and\u2026 This is so ridiculous.

I\u2019m old enough to remember when MAGA GOP impeached Secretary Mayorkas because of the urgent needs at the border. *checks notes* That was over a month ago and MAGA still hasn\u2019t sent the impeachment articles to senate for a trial. So urgent! years ago a national emergency was declared and America dipped into a Trump Slump. This is how MAGA reacts when you push back. Guess what? It\u2019s not stopping me. Classic child. Confident + Content What Laura Ingraham didn\u2019t tell her viewers last night when she smeared me over TikTok is that FOX is on TikTok! #BREAKING This is ALWAYS how it was going to go down.

As a mother and educator, I can only imagine the terror the families felt not knowing, not seeing, or not knowing if their loved ones were alive. Since that journey, we did bring back many of the girls and I had the chance to meet many of them. Sadly, some were never found. That\u2019s why today and everyday, I am committed to doing everything I can to destroy the cruel terrorists group of Boko Haram. Let us remember the victims of Boko Haram today, because while the world might have forgotten about them, the girls and their families will never forget.

I voted for a bill to reauthorize & reform FISA, a nat'l security program that keeps the US a step ahead of our adversaries. With reforms to the FISA program, this bill will ensure Americans\u2019 civil liberties are protected & our nation remains safeguarded from threats abroad. There is no such thing as cancelling student loans. Biden\u2019s proposed idea would only shift responsibility of paying these loans to hardworking Americans, many of whom did not attend college.

I just voted in favor of several bills on the House floor to restore American energy dominance, support American jobs, and protect our allies. My full statement on the DHS funding included in the second appropriations package. Dept. of Commerce announces new CHIPS and Science Act funding, which I voted for in Congress, for Ohio. This critical investment will bolster American manufacturing, secure our supply chain, and create jobs across Ohio. With a string of Executive Orders, the Biden Administration created the crisis at our southern border. If the federal government won\u2019t protect them, Texas has a right to defend its citizens from this crisis. Too often I hear from my constituents about issues they face with the backlog in passport applications. I recently supported legislation to not only address this backlog but modernize the system to streamline applications in the future.

The CCP uses apps, like TikTok, to tell Chinese nationals how to cross our border illegally. If TikTok is unwilling to cut ties with China to help prevent messages like these, they should be banned in the US. Proud to vote in favor of legislation today to enforce just that. Unsurprisingly, President Biden\u2019s trillion budget proposal for includes requests that will only increase our national debt beyond repair. As Chairman of the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, I am disappointed in his DHS funding request, which is full of gimmicks that do anything but secure the border. I look forward to scrutinizing his spending requests with this year. Congratulations to my friend as she transitions from her role as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. As a Cleveland native and my former Congressional colleague, I have no doubt she will continue to do great things for the area in her next chapter. ICYMI: Mr. President, the border crisis is not on us, it\u2019s on you As an appropriator, I will always fight to bring your hard-earned tax dollars back home.

Bidenomics is crushing Americans. #SOTU I hear concerns from constituents every day about our open borders, inflation, and rampant crime in our communities. That is the real State of the Union. Biden must address these issues tonight. #SOTU Laken Riley is another tragic example of innocent Americans falling victim to Biden\u2019s border crisis. I supported the Laken Riley Act on the House floor today to uphold the rule of law and ensure another tragedy like this never happens again. We must protect our children. In just months, more than Chinese nationals have been encountered at the Southwest border. China and our other foreign adversaries are exploiting Biden\u2019s porous southern border, creating a major national security risk for all Americans.

For the sake of our nation, I hope to hear a plan to secure our border, rein in government spending, and foster American energy independence. Biden\u2019s trip to the border this week was nothing more than a photo op. Happy Birthday, Ohio! Grateful to represent the Buckeye state in Congress. O-H! Since October there have been known gotaways who made it across the border without being apprehended. If Congress doesn\u2019t work to keep the Government open, CBP agents and officers on the frontlines, who are already overworked, will have to go WITHOUT PAY. Reflecting on the appropriations process as I\u2019m heading to D.C. As an appropriator, I have championed passing all individual spending bills filled with conservative wins. However, let me be clear, a gov\u2019t shutdown only hurts Ohioans. I will work to prevent that this week. TOMORROW: My staff is hosting mobile office hours in Trumbull County. Make sure to stop by! Drones made by CCP-owned companies are China\u2019s modern-day Trojan Horse. My bill, the SOAR Act, will ban the use of these foreign-made drones and encourage the production of American-made alternatives, protecting Americans\u2019 data and promoting domestic innovation. Over million illegal immigrants have entered the U.S. since Biden took office, an amount greater than the population of states. Congress must do everything we can to secure our southern border. Joe Biden clearly won\u2019t. President Biden is once again forcing American taxpayers who didn\u2019t sign up for these student loans to foot the bill for those who did. Proud to introduce the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative alongside my colleagues on the bipartisan Great Lakes Task Force to support the ecosystem & economic health of the Great Lakes. Having grown up on the shores of Lake Erie, I will always fight to protect them in Congress.

See here for my full statement on my vote to impeach Secretary Mayorkas Disgusting display of antisemitism on CSU\u2019s campus. Universities must do better. I look forward to hearing how plans to address this. The House just PASSED my bill, the WILD Act, to protect and preserve habitats and endangered wildlife in the Great Lakes and across the country. With its passage in the House, we are one step closer to improving our nation\u2019s conservation efforts. President Biden\u2019s reckless decision to ban American LNG exports threatens American jobs, energy security, and the economy. This week, I joined of my colleagues in calling on Biden to immediately reverse this decision. Last week, House Republicans passed FOUR strong, conservative bills to crack down on illegal immigration.

This Congress, I am honored to co-lead a resolution with Congresswoman to celebrate and recognize the contributions CRNAs make every day throughout health systems in Ohio and across the United States. . is right. If the federal government is failing to secure the border, states shouldn\u2019t be prevented from doing so to protect their citizens in its place. Border Patrol agents put their lives on the line every day to protect us. Yet, the Biden Admin is doing everything in their power to make their jobs more dangerous. In contrast, my homeland security appropriations bill that passed the House supports BP agents on the frontlines. As a father of three, I know that parents know what it is best for their children, not the government. School choice allows for each child to have the best chance possible to succeed and reach their full potential in school. Last year, I cosponsored the Educational Choice for Children Act to provide parents with the ability and means to choose the right educational path for their children. This legislation will ensure each child is one step closer to the American Dream.

My Homeland Security appropriations bill does just that. Listen more from my conversation with After removing the Houthis from the US foreign terrorist list yrs ago, the Biden Admin has officially re-designated them as terrorists.

WATCH \u2192 Democrat Rep. Jayapal says she's worried about \"giving away leverage\" by supporting more aid for small businesses to pay their employees. American workers are losing their jobs. Small businesses are closing permanently. This is about people's livelihoods, not leverage. BREAKING \u2192 The House just passed a bipartisan bill to force TikTok to sever their ties with the Chinese Communist Party. This is a critical national security issue. The Senate must take this up and pass it. A resounding rebuke of liberal activist judges attempting to interfere in the election. Glad the Supreme Court got this right. Let me be clear: The Senate Border Bill will NOT receive a vote in the House. Here\u2019s what the people pushing this \u201cdeal\u201d aren\u2019t telling you: It accepts illegal immigrants a day and gives automatic work permits to asylum recipients\u2014a magnet for more illegal immigration. BREAKING: Just filed a Supreme Court amicus brief with \u2014joined by House and Senate Trump\u2019s Colorado ballot appeal. The Colorado Supreme Court is setting a dangerous precedent and subverting the will of the people. Let's be clear: A Leftist came to that baseball field in specifically to kill Republicans. He had a hit list in his pocket. The FBI's original classification of this attack as \"suicide by cop\" was absurd and overtly political. Full Video: years ago my colleagues & I were attacked playing we\u2019re Republicans. We didn't let it stop us then & nothing will stop us now. It's been a long journey, but tonight we play the Congressional Baseball years stronger. Full Video: Everyone already knows we're in a they feel the pain of it every day. The Biden attempt to spin it any other way is pathetic and offensive. If Dems had their way, there would be unlimited abortion on demand\u2014paid for by taxpayers. Proof of that: After the Supreme Court leak last month, Senate Dems rushed to push for a vote on a bill that would've legalized abortion through all nine months of pregnancy. Here's the reality: Bidenomics is costing American households more a year. Hardworking families shouldn't be forced to live like this. MILLION illegal immigrants have entered the U.S. under Biden\u2014more than the population of states. This was the Left's plan from the start when they canceled Remain in Mexico + ended catch & release. Biden could fix it by reversing his executive actions\u2014but he refuses. Another attack on American energy by the Biden Administration. He is completely controlled by the climate mob. He always puts their demands over hardworking families. This will cost us jobs and growth, jeopardize national security, and jack up prices. Why isn't Congress acting quickly? Pelosi & Schumer are exploiting this crisis to play politics. Unrelated liberal wish list items they're putting over families & healthcare workers: \u2013 More power for unions \u2013 More fuel emission regulations \u2013 Wind & solar tax credits Shameful. First Biden drains our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to artificially lower gas prices so he\u2019d look better politically as his radical policies caused energy prices to soar. Now he\u2019s delaying refilling it. This is another national security problem caused by his reckless actions.", "There\u2019s no denying that hardworking Americans are paying more at the grocery store under President Biden just to put food on the table. Fruits & Veggies Baked Goods & Cereal Meat, Fish, and Eggs Beverages Dairy We have the chance to enact meaningful tax reform. The bipartisan tax package revives pro-growth policies and provides relief to families & small businesses.

Not only is it significant for humans to be reminded that we\u2019ve been forgiven of our sins, but it\u2019s a part of something much bigger; it reminds us that Jesus suffered in order for our sins to be forgiven. The federal government will pay over trillion just in interest on the debt this fiscal year. As I repeatedly warn about on the House Floor each week, the debt death spiral is rapidly approaching. We\u2019re closing in on million migrant apprehensions in U.S. Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens referred to the border crisis as a \u201cnational security threat.\u201d Securing the border has never been a higher priority \u2014 President Biden must act immediately. On National Medal of Honor Day, we celebrate the brave American service members who have distinguished themselves by going above and beyond the call of duty to protect our great nation. We will always remain grateful for their selfless commitment to defending freedom. May CBO projects debt increase of in June OMB projects debt increase of in Current borrowing to-date: At current borrowing rates, we\u2019ll add to the debt in How could CBO and OMB be so off in their projections? President Biden\u2019s budget increases debt held by the public to trillion by \u2014 a increase. That\u2019s just the BASELINE estimate. Let\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s no room for fiscal sanity in the Biden Administration. Arizona families received tax relief last year after suffering from historic inflation levels. The IRS then decided months later to tax their rebate. I joined & in demanding the IRS reverse this terrible decision. Personal data should be considered a property right. I\u2019ve introduced legislation previously to protect Americans\u2019 data privacy and prevent their personal information from ending up in the hands of those who exploit us Read more here on the prevalence of unrestrained data collection: Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet with and lead a tour for a group of incredibly insightful students from the University of Southern California. Moments like these are what makes my job so meaningful. These are our change makers. The coming generations are our future. The bottom line is if you live in the area and haven\u2019t received a pay increase in the last years, you are poorer today than when President Biden took office. No matter the spin, American families are still feeling the effects of inflation. I took my fascination with AI & turned it into legislation that could contribute to reducing our national deficit.

Our nation\u2019s fiscal health is rapidly deteriorating. Today marks the National #SlamTheScam Day, a day to raise awareness about the common occurrence of imposter scams and fraud. Avoid becoming the victim of fraud and know what to do if your #SocialSecurity information is compromised. Throughout my time in Congress, I\u2019ve championed impactful legislation, like the Paws Off Act, to further protect our furry companions. I am humbled to be a recipient of the Legislative Leader award to honor my proactive initiative on animal welfare issues in #HumaneAwards I\u2019ve been saying it for years \u2014 we have a math problem. It's long past time we got serious about solving our nation's fiscal challenges. We\u2019ve added trillion to the national debt just months into That\u2019s billion of borrowing every day and over each second. If today\u2019s numbers hold, we\u2019ll add nearly trillion in debt this fiscal year, shattering CBO's projections. The Tucson Sector remains a hotspot for migrant encounters at our southern border, yet President Biden chose to go to Brownsville last week for a photo-op instead. The Biden admin continues to show they are deeply unserious about fixing the border crisis.

Happy Women\u2019s History Month to all the amazing women I\u2019ve had the blessing of being surrounded by! Last I checked, Arizona's southern border is in desperate need of reinforcements. Why then is President Biden choosing to go to the busiest Border Patrol station? Enough with the photo-ops. We need border security now. Our national debt just eclipsed trillion and is increasing by each second. These numbers should terrify every American.

The Tucson Sector alone has seen over migrant encounters since the start of \u2014 the most of any region along the southern border. President Biden created this crisis, and he still refuses to fix it. My wife and I struggled for years to have children. Today, we are blessed to have two beautiful children. IVF is a valuable and important tool for many Arizona families. I will oppose any effort to restrict it. Just a reminder that we're borrowing over every second, every day. We must turn our fiscal trajectory around to avoid the economic calamity that's headed our way. For more updates on our national debt, sign up to receive my Daily Debt Monitor at migrant encounters at the southern border since Biden took office.

Zoom details below For the federal tax system to work, taxpayers must be confident that their private taxpayer information is safe & protected. The IRS must take immediate steps to safeguard taxpayers' personal information & ensure private tax returns are never leaked again. Will my brothers and sisters on the Left ever put batteries in their calculators? Every dime that Congress votes on is borrowed. Drastic change is needed to restore our fiscal health. I've seen floor fights over discretionary spending cuts where the cost of federal borrowing during the debate eclipsed the amount of money that the debate was fighting to save. The House-passed Tax Relief for American Families & Workers Act secures pro-growth tax policies like immediate R&D expensing, helping preserve jobs and million/year in R&D-related wages in Arizona.

How many more individuals on the terror watchlist have crossed our southern border because of President Biden\u2019s failed border policies? We all want our children and future generations to thrive with the same prosperity we\u2019ve been afforded. They deserve to flourish. Is per second of borrowing really what we intend to pass on to them? The Biden open-border policies are to blame for incidents like this. We need immediate border security to protect our law enforcement officers and communities around the country. Two words to describe 's Tax Relief for American Families & Workers Act: Good Bill. Tonight, the House passed \u2019s bipartisan tax bill that advances pro-growth, pro-worker & pro-American tax policies \u2014 providing relief to families & businesses while boosting economic prosperity. This is a good deal that works for all Americans. My remarks If you live in the area and haven\u2019t received a nearly pay increase in the last years, you are poorer today than when President Biden took office. Too many Border Patrol agents are put at risk because of high-speed pursuits at our southern border. Yesterday, I voted to pass \u2019s Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act which toughens penalties for those fleeing arrest near the border when they\u2019re behind the wheel. Over the past year, the national debt has grown by trillion. Since the start of the debt has increased by nearly billion per day. At this current rate, the national debt will surpass trillion between May and May The Tax Relief for American Families & Workers Act supports small businesses and innovators in by extending pro-growth policies that lower costs to combat inflation, increase investment to create jobs & eliminate bureaucratic red tape for businesses throughout the country. Over the last year, the increase in the national debt outpaced economic growth by more than trillion. Simply put \u2014 our country is on an unsustainable fiscal path. We must address our rapidly surging debt before it cripples our economy. An al-Shabaab terrorist caught at the border last March was allowed to freely roam around the US for nearly a year before his recent arrest in Minnesota.

I am proud to say I received an \"A\" rating from the End Citizens United // Let America Vote Action Fund for my commitment to end the dominance of big money in politics, safeguard our election system, and protect the freedom to vote for all Americans. Today, I voted against the Republican-led, Israeli appropriations bill. I am a strong supporter of Israel, but we need to help innocent Palestinian women, children and families with humanitarian aid, such as food and water, during this difficult time. I was proud to vote to support DHS Secretary Mayorkas today and I'm glad he survived the factless, baseless Republican attack. Republicans are focused on political attacks and not the American people. Democrats always put people over Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver was a trailblazer and tremendous leader in New Jersey. More than that, she was a mentor and dear friend of mine. I honored her on the House floor. If you have relatives or friends who served in the military and has yet to receive an earned medal, contact my office and we can work to get medals to them. Today, I met with Jim Pelliccio, President & CEO of the Port Newark Container Terminal (PNCT), to get an update on the progress of the Port Newark Development Plan. I was proud to celebrate Black History Month at Union County College today. It was great to see Clinton Miller, Rev. Dr. Wanda Marie Lundy, Union County Chairwoman Kimberly Mouded, Vice Chairwoman Leon Lourdes, and Union College President Dr. Margaret M. McMenamin at the event. It's despicable that House Republicans would rather Joe Biden look bad than move towards fixing the issues at our southern border. If Republicans call it a crisis, then act! But they want America to suffer to try and help their Lord Donald I applaud President Biden\u2019s decision to enact sanctions, such as visa bans and financial sanctions, on Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have killed and injured Palestinians. Congratulations to Nicolas Fonseca!! The student from Cranford was accepted at the U.S. Naval Academy. This is an incredible honor and I'm extremely proud of him. Good luck, Nicolas!

I want to congratulate Joselyn A. De Salguero!! The Union High School student has been accepted to attend West Point Academy. This is an amazing honor and I am extremely proud of her! Good luck, Joselyn!! February is Black History Month. I spoke about it on the House floor today.", "The President of the United States is openly letting people know that he is incompetent to do his job. RIDICULOUS You can\u2019t fix this kind of stupid! Biden announced a stall on banning menthol cigarettes due to black voting turnout concerns. Anyone else spot the hypocrisy? The moral outrage of the left only extends to the point it does not hurt them politically! Biden delays menthol ban amid concerns over black support For anyone who thinks Joe Biden struggles, get a load of this I believe VP Harris just makes crap up and hopes no one catches it. This Couple Is Going Viral for Having Two Car Payments Totaling (USD) a Month It is still amazing to me that the Media will act like the sky is falling every time Donald Trump posts, but will ignore the fact that our current Commander in Chief is lost in his surroundings most of the time. 'I was on script and was told not to deviate' says ESPN\u2019s Sage Steele when she interviewed Joe Biden in This entire Presidency has been a puppet show because Joe Biden is clearly not in charge of America.

However, time and time again, we have seen Democrat Mayors and Governors blame crimes on the result rather than the cause of action. Crime will always continue to skyrocket as long as\u2026 There is a clear difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and it\u2019s not just about LAW and ORDER, it\u2019s also about compassion. One hosted a fundraiser while the other attended the wake of an officer after a criminal, who had been arrested times, had murdered him. You\u2026 Horrible tragedy. I\u2019m praying all those involved and for a safe rescue How about we spend our tax dollars to bring in economists to explain how the real world works for the President! One of the many reasons November cannot get here quick enough! The United States should be one of the top suppliers of the world\u2019s oil.

About to go live shortly for ! Tune We found out yesterday that Google interfered with our elections times. The only headlines MSM are running is about Trump! This is not about reporting news, this is about pushing a political agenda in America. The fact that MSNBC is still running the debunked \u201cbloodbath\u201d story today is all you need to know about the media in America. This is exactly why Americans have zero faith in our news media Short game is still a work in progress, but it\u2019s always a blast playing at one of my favorite North GA golf courses! Check out Valhalla! If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it is a Duck! However, Judge McAfee chose to call it something else today. If both Fani and Wade were involved, both should be punished! A missed chance for justice. Donald Trump is now our nominee for the Republican Party. I don\u2019t care what happened in the primary or who you supported, a Republican will ALWAYS be better than a Democrat. If we want to win this November, we have to UNITE and elect President Trump! Robert Hur said it himself that he didn\u2019t exonerate Joe Biden. Yet he chose not to prosecute! He felt he couldn\u2019t win the case because of Biden\u2019s mental state! Too mentally deficient to stand trial, but ok to be President? The story of the Biden Administration! Inflation rate today: Inflation rate January Explain to me again how Bidenomics are working?

Joe Biden it is Laken Riley not Lincoln Riley. This is disgusting. Her memory deserves better! Joe Biden is not delivering a State Of the Union, he is delivering a divisive angry campaign speech. This is sad. So far mins into STOTU. Here is what Biden thinks are the top priorities: -Ukraine over American Border -Attacks on Conservative Voters -Abortion -Attack Donald Trump This is going downhill in a hurry The State of the Union tonight is not being looked at by any media, foreign adversaries, or Americans to see any real ideas to get our nation back. They are just there to see when it goes off the tracks! I hope Joe Biden mentions Laken Riley in the SOTU tomorrow and is genuine about her and our border crisis, without political bias. But I\u2019m not holding my breath. For more than years, we have seen Joe Biden and this Administration gaslight us to think that our Border is\u2026 Congrats to President Trump on his BIG wins last night. Just as we said after Iowa, it is clear that we MUST unite and deliver Republican victories across America, before its too late!

Just so everyone is clear, Trump has: -Never been charged as an insurrectionist -Never been convicted of insurrection -Never committed insurrection Truth matters and comments like this are the actual misinformation we should be worrying about. BIG win, not only for President Trump, but America in general! Glad to see SCOTUS got this right and UNANIMOUSLY Don\u2019t let Joe Biden lie to you that he can\u2019t do anything at the border. In his first Days in office, he took Executive actions to dismantle border security and explode our crisis. He needs to do more order putting them all back! Update: the \u201cAbolish Prison\u201d Athens Socialist Commissioner just deleted their account Being a military spouse is a hard journey being married to a service member, and I know first-hand with my wife, Lisa.

Time to put the ego aside, Nikki! California Congresswoman Katie Porter said that the murder of Laken Riley \u201cshouldn\u2019t shape\u201d immigration policy! It\u2019s outrageous how delusional these democrats are becoming. Illegal immigration is becoming a front and center issue in Americans\u2019 lives! Laken Riley did not deserve\u2026 A County Commissioner of Athens, with \u201cabolish prison\u201d in their bio, is more concerned about safeguarding the woke ideology of a MURDERER\u2019S RACE rather than prioritizing why this tragedy happened. Athens is and has been ran by literal socialists who proclaim \u201cdefund the police\u201d\u2026 I am Infuriated. Joe Biden (Ice Cream in hand) talking so callously about our Border Crisis when in Georgia we just had a brutal murder of a female UGA nursing student by an Illegal Immigrant. He should have never been here in the first place. I\u2019m sick of it. Joe Biden and\u2026 Nikki Haley is basically no longer a Republican Candidate for President.

Chase was a former intern in my Congressional office where we all grew to learn about his heart and passion for public service. As the son of a State Trooper, this hits especially hard on days like today.\u2026 PBMs are not the answer and the State of Georgia should not be allowing these groups to destroy local Pharmacists while enriching themselves in the process. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Take a look at how they are affecting prices I hope GA legislators will act! How to know Democrats are nervous: - They are defending an indefensible court verdict! - They are trying to spin the last couple of days in court was good for DA Fani Willis and her office. - And they are trying to convince America that the President is not having trouble\u2026 So let me get this straight: - You ask to borrow money - The bank takes your application and checks it out - They loan you the money - You pay back the money - The bank says they would loan to you again! Would someone please point out the fraud? This wasn\u2019t about the law\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure this Administration is WANTING us to know that they do not care about our Southern Border, crime, or rising inflation. They are too busy boasting about being everywhere BUT America! Fani Willis and Nathan Wade have been dating since The arrogance is just breathtaking! Time for this to be over! Jack Smith thinks his right to prosecute Donald Trump outweighs Donald Trump\u2019s rights to a fair hearing. Jack Smith wants his moment of publicity to be damned with the rights of the accused. How can anyone seeing this think it\u2019s fair? Our Commander in Chief was told by his own DOJ that he is an \u201celderly man with a poor memory\" and he responded by: -Blaming his staff -Lashing out at reporters -Attacking Donald Trump -Referred the Egyptian President as \u201cPresident of Mexico\u201d This is an utter embarrassment. It is beneath the office of the President to blame his wrongdoing on his staff! So now that we know Biden\u2019s own DOJ thinks he is too senile to stand trial, it really begs the question: Who is running our country? Democrats and Joe Biden just released their plan: \u201cI don\u2019t remember what I\u2019m doing so reelect me President!\u201d Nikki Haley has turned her entire failing campaign into attacking Donald Trump. Which her comments will be used against Republicans across the country in different races. She is hurting Republican\u2019s chances in because she refuses to see that this race is OVER. Literally \u201cnobody\u201d just wiped the floor in Nevada last night against you. Is this a parody account? Please show me the path forward! Haley\u2019s campaign would rather try and tear down Donald Trump than focus on winning in November. Nevada has perfectly summed up the GOP primary better than any analyst or reporter could ever attempt., the writing on the wall is clear! Face the facts, this race is over, time to focus on defeating Biden. Happy Birthday, Lisa! You continuously amaze me everyday and you still take my breath away! I love you! Our Executive Branch is just openly lying to us now. We all saw the video. Just be honest and admit Joe Biden likes to make stuff up. Everyone is hyper fixated on Trump, but the media really should be checking in on President Obama.

If we are going to debate what constitutes\u2026 Still looking at this \u201cborder deal\u201d and right now, this is horrible.

This is unacceptable and should have never happened and cannot be forgotten. I\u2019m praying for those killed in action today. Let me get this straight: After years of Joe Biden saying there was \u201cno border crisis\u201d and refusing to go to the Southern Border during his Administration, he now agrees there is a problem, and he has no plan to address the MILLIONS of illegal migrants currently in our country?\u2026 The Georgia State Senate just voted to BAN Ranked Choice voting!

On day one of Biden\u2019s Administration, he waged war on American energy. continues to fight back \u2013 and today we brought two bills to the floor to unleash American energy dominance. As someone that ran a healthcare practice in rural America, I know firsthand that one of the biggest challenges is the cost of doing business due to regulatory burdens. It\u2019s a model that isn\u2019t working & it\u2019s driving people out of private practice. More from today's hearing . is taking a bold step today to get America\u2019s fiscal house in order. Our fiscal resolution will of runaway spending, root out waste & fraud, and reignite economic prosperity. No matter what you offer to pay people in rural communities, there simply aren\u2019t enough healthcare workers there. We have to get engaged in workforce development to be able to produce a workforce that can actually meet those needs. More from today\u2019s hearing is a leader in investments and job creation in the clean energy space.

Also proud of and all the Vogtle partners in making clean, nuclear energy a reality in Georgia. \u201cAll of the above\u201d is the right energy strategy for our country both now and in the future. In Biden's first days, he issued over executive actions on immigration, hampering the ability of & causing total chaos for over years with unprecedented numbers of illegal migrants entering our country. His policies are indefensible & Americans deserve answers. First they label parents at school board meetings domestic terrorists, & now this! Complete silence on riots, cartel drug trade, looting and illegal immigrants murdering college students. The hypocrisy stinks like three day old roadkill on South Georgia asphalt in July. Biden's disastrous open border policies led to the death of Laken Riley & continue to bring serious national security implications to every community across GA - & our nation. The American people deserve to know who is entering our country & being released into our communities. Proud to support in his efforts to get answers so that we can keep our citizens & communities safe. Our hearts go out to the family, friends & loved ones of UGA student Laken Riley. It\u2019s appalling that the murderer is one of the millions of unvetted illegal migrants released into our country due to Biden\u2019s asinine open border policies - which are simply indefensible.

In the wake of a family member\u2019s death, hardworking rural farmers & small business owners should not be forced to pay an unfair double tax. Our tax policy should help these businesses thrive. Tens of thousands of people are dying due to fentanyl overdoses & the cost of illegal immigration is on track to bankrupt our country.

If the CIA stopped an investigatory interview into Hunter's tax evasion, then the agents were most likely directed by others. Are White House officials involved in covering up his crimes? This is VERY concerning & we must do all we can to track down these whistleblower claims. The Francis Scott Key Bridge is one of the most recognizable and bridges in Baltimore. This is terrible news.

It is our sworn duty as members of Congress to govern, and I look forward to serving on the Rules Committee to help advance legislation that benefits the American people. Our nation lost a great patriot and Georgian today. Col. Ralph Puckett Jr. was the last living Medal of Honor recipient from the Korean War. He was a fearless man who fought off five assaults by enemy forces even when outnumbered He was a blessing to all who knew him. Happy Easter! My family and I wish you a joyous day of celebration for the resurrection of our Savior. He is risen! Biden\u2019s new tailpipe emissions rule puts our country at the tail end of Communist China. I adamantly oppose this ruling, and I am working with my colleagues to combat it and preserve our energy independence and vehicle choice. Communist China is our adversary, and it is vital for our national security not to let them have global control over the chemicals, technology, or seeds needed to produce our food supply. Happy National Ag Day! I joined in penning an op-ed in thanking farmers for their hard work. Read below: Biden\u2019s decision to build a port near Gaza is clearly putting our troops in harm\u2019s way. This puts our troops within range of Iranian proxies\u2019 rockets. President Biden has consistently made disastrous policy decisions that have put our national and global security at risk. He is directly responsible for the crisis at our southern border. Tonight, he announced that he is asking our military to build a port in Gaza, which means sending U.S. soldiers to a territory that is controlled by Iranian proxies. He has chosen not to listen to our military leaders for his entire Presidency, and he failed to take accountability for his actions during tonight\u2019s State of the Union address. Republicans want Ukraine to win and Putin to lose. I told that in order to help Ukraine win the war against Russia, Biden has to enforce the sanctions against them. President Biden\u2019s border policies have caused a national security crisis in our backyard, and it is far past time for him to secure the border and prioritize the safety of Americans. I joined the Georgia GOP delegation in sending a letter to Biden after the death of Laken Riley. The Biden Administration needs to explain why they haven\u2019t enforced existing sanctions on Russia. This has allowed Russia to rebuild their economy and their complex. Biden\u2019s decision not to enforce sanctions against Russia has been detrimental to Ukraine. Because of Biden\u2019s decisions, Russia\u2019s economy has grown since they invaded, allowing them to keep funding the war. Navalny was jailed and killed by Putin for being his political opponent. This is who Putin is and how he has maintained power for so Our farmers need support now more than ever, but less than of the Farm Bill is going to support production agriculture. This has to change. I asked Secretary Vilsack if he\u2019s even spoken with farmers lately about how increased input costs are impacting them. Mayorkas\u2019 refusal to enforce the laws of this country makes him unfit to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security. His indifference to the border crisis, which is a serious threat to our national security, is appalling to me and most Americans. This promise to increase the flow of illegal immigration proves that Biden is creating this crisis intentionally and doesn\u2019t care how much damage his backward policies do to Americans or our national security. He can close the border today, but he has chosen not to. I haven\u2019t forgotten what Mayorkas did to his own CBP agents in October of He knew that they weren\u2019t whipping migrants, but instead of defending his agents and telling the truth, he lied to push Biden\u2019s agenda. This is one of the many reasons I voted to impeach Mayorkas. Biden's delayed response to the Iranian proxies attacking U.S. servicemembers jeopardized the safety of our deployed across the globe. He waited until they attacked us over times and killed three of our own. I applaud the bravery and skill of , who carried out multiple airstrikes against Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and affiliated militia groups today. Those who strike against the U.S. will face consequences. terrorist organizations carried out over strikes against the U.S. or our friends & the Biden Admin did NOTHING. These Iranian proxies won\u2019t stop now that they\u2019ve got American blood on their hands- that\u2019s the price of Biden\u2019s inaction. I am saddened to learn that three soldiers were KIA as a result of an Iranian proxy attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan. All three servicemembers were Army Reserve soldiers from Ft. Moore, Georgia. My wife Vivien and I extend our condolences to their families whose loss cannot be measured with words, and we are praying for a swift recovery for the dozens of additional servicemembers who were injured in the attack. It is past time for the Biden Administration to take action and eliminate the Iranian proxies responsible for this outrageous attack. Agriculture is Georgia's number one industry, and it was an honor to talk about legislative priorities to support agribusiness at the UGA Ag Forecast. I'm working in Washington to cut back federal regulations that are especially difficult for small family farms. I had the honor of celebrating the delivery of the Super Hercules to the at facility in Marietta! has a legacy of great leaders, and this fine aircraft will serve our Air National Guard well while they serve our great nation. I supported the continuing resolution today because it is the better of two bad choices. The government will continue to function while Congress negotiates appropriations. Biden should have hammered Houthis the second they fired their rockets months ago. Our national security cannot afford Biden\u2019s weakness, whether it\u2019s at the border or abroad. Today, we celebrate the remarkable life and lasting legacy of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Let us embrace his timeless truth: 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' Inspired by his message, we remind ourselves to champion equality and value all human life.

I joined to discuss how the House Intelligence Committee is taking steps to prevent future FISA abuses from happening again. The Biden family received millions of dollars from our adversaries, and it is our responsibility in Congress to investigate whether the President was involved or not. Happy birthday to our oldest fighting force, Their roots can be traced back to the first militia regiments in MA in Since their founding, they have embodied the civilian soldier mentality and have taken a significant role in U.S. national security. What\u2019s good for production agriculture is good for the consumer. Current reference prices do not reflect the increased cost of farming today, and we need to address that in the Farm Bill. Happy Thanksgiving! As you share a meal with your family today, I hope that you thank the farmers who worked hard to make it possible. Rosalynn Carter was an outstanding Georgian and a distinguished humanitarian who dedicated her life to bettering her country and community. My prayers are with President Jimmy Carter and the Carter family today. A streamlined program is critical for the agriculture industry, and many of our nation's small farmers cannot keep up with continuous rule and regulation changes from . I led a letter to Acting Secretary Su opposing a burdensome September proposed rule to Thank you to my colleagues for supporting our farmers: The bipartisan continuing resolution passed today was a compromise that keeps our government open and extends the Farm Bill so our farmers can continue to feed our nation. I supported this resolution, and now Speaker Johnson has more time to negotiate responsible spending levels in future appropriations measures. This Veterans Day, I encourage you to join me in honoring those who have served in the U.S. armed forces and their families who support them. Thank you, veterans, who have sacrificed so much for our country; our nation is the land of the free because it is the home of the brave. Happy birthday ! Thank you to our Marines! Antisemitism has no place in Congress. Last night, I voted to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib over her remarks about Israel. This resolution passed by a bipartisan vote of Our country continues to stand strong behind Israel as they defend themselves against Hamas. Today is the National Day of the Deployed, where we honor the brave men and women in uniform deployed on missions worldwide. Our district is home to thousands of guardsmen, reservists, and personnel from Robins and Moody Air Force Bases. We honor the deployed servicemembers, their families, and friends who support our troops in harm\u2019s way. I am proud to stand with Israel. With my support, the House just passed a bipartisan resolution reaffirming our support for Israel and condemning the barbaric terrorist actions of Hamas over the last days. Now more than ever, the people of Israel need our support. Mike Johnson is a good man, a good friend, and a good American. I have full faith that he will lead our Congress and country in the right direction. Let\u2019s get the House back to work! If we are going to be the majority we need to act like the majority, and that means we have to do the right things the right way. I supported and voted for Rep. Jim Jordan to be the Speaker of the House. Now that he has withdrawn I am running again to be the Speaker of the House. I stand with Israel as they defend themselves against Hamas. I fully support Israel benefitting from our arsenal of democracy of American weapons and technology to bring this war to a quick conclusion. I joined to express support for Israel, and discuss the Speaker\u2019s race. It\u2019s time to elect our Speaker so the People\u2019s House can get back to serving the people. I highly respect Jim Jordan. He is an asset to the Republican Party and our nominee for Speaker. Our conference has spoken, and now we must unite behind Jordan so we can get Congress back to work. I have filed to be Speaker of the House. We are in Washington to legislate, and I want to lead a House that functions in the best interest of the American people. Happy National Farmer's Day to all our great Georgia farmers! You are the backbone of our country, and we can't thank you enough for all the hard work that you do to produce the food and fiber we depend on. If you are funding terrorism, then you are a terrorist. We, as the United States, need to make sure to do everything to support Israel as they defend themselves against Hamas and those who fund them. This barbaric attack on Israeli citizens is unconscionable. I stand with the people of Israel. They have a right to defend themselves against these brutal attacks from Hamas terrorists. The eight Republicans who supported Joe Biden and the Democrats\u2019 desire to remove Kevin McCarthy as Speaker are nothing more than grifters who have handed control of the House to the Democratic Party in the name of their own glory and fundraising. There is nothing principled about what they did, and Republican leadership will have to decide to either hold these members accountable or lose the faith of the rest of the conference. I support Speaker McCarthy. This motion to vacate is a selfish waste of time motivated out of the personal spite of a select few towards McCarthy. It disrupts our ability to govern and pass needed appropriations. Proof of the lengths that some Democrats were willing to go to try and force a shutdown simply to blame Republicans for it. The bipartisan CR passed by the House today isn\u2019t perfect, but it prevents a government shutdown for days. Congress will return to Washington on Monday to continue our work to pass responsible appropriations bills. The CR on the floor today does NOT include a pay raise for Members of Congress. Democrats are lying to you because they want to shut the government down and blame Republicans. . is blaming people he calls \u201cextreme MAGA Republicans\u201d for the potential shutdown while he and his entire party voted against legislation to avoid shutdown. House Democrats are blaming Republicans for the potential shutdown when all are voting against the CR that would keep the government open. They need to take responsibility for their votes. Communist China is our adversary, and if the Biden family has used Joe Biden's position to do business with them, then they have betrayed our national security. Happy Birthday to the U.S. Air Force! Georgia\u2019s District is the proud home of the Air Force Reserve Headquarters and Robins and Moody AFB. Georgia is home to the best Air National Guard in the U.S. My Grandfather, Lt. Jack Austin Scott, was a POW for months during WWII, and he fortunately came home. Today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day, and I hope you will join me in honoring the Prisoners of War and those who haven't returned from the fight for our freedom. Happy day to all, and a special thank you to all the hardworking peanut farmers in Georgia! Today is the anniversary of We remember the lives that were lost during the tragic attacks, and we also honor the heroes and families who continue to suffer from the effects of the attacks today. We will never forget the sacrifices and bravery of our first responders. Happy Labor Day! Georgia is home to some of the finest law enforcement officers in the country. Unfortunately, this week, we lost Wilcox County Sheriff Robert Rodgers, who passed during a traffic accident while on duty. He spent his career protecting Georgia\u2019s Eighth District, working as an investigator in Twiggs and Crisp counties before taking over as Sheriff in Wilcox County in My family and I are praying for Sheriff Rodgers\u2019 family as our community mourns his loss. My office and I are coordinating with local, state, and federal officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA) in the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia. Self-Report Damages to GEMA: Georgians can self-report damages to their homes, businesses, and public facilities so GEMA can visualize and summarize damage assessments as they are collected by the public. Self-report at: Crisis Cleanup: Crisis Cleanup is a collaborative disaster work order management platform that improves coordination, reduces duplication of efforts, improves efficiency, and improves volunteers' experience. If you need assistance, call Crisis Cleanup at GEMA Public Assistance: The DA for one of the largest Democratic counties in GA, a county where Joe Biden got of the vote in has claimed her moment of fame and fulfilled her campaign promise by indicting former President Trump in Fulton County right before an election year. This is the latest example of the left\u2019s abuse of the justice system. Two years ago today, Kabul fell to the Taliban after President Biden ignored the advice of his own National Security Team. This led to billions of dollars worth of U.S. military equipment being handed to the Taliban and the loss of U.S. service members. If any of Trump\u2019s children did the things that Hunter Biden has while his father was in office, the media would be outraged. So why is Hunter being treated any differently? Bidenomics isn\u2019t working, and Americans are struggling to make ends meet while this administration shells subsidies to failed green new deal companies. I joined to discuss: Today is National Purple Heart Day, where we remember and honor the sacrifices made by Purple Heart veterans who were wounded or lost their lives in combat. Earlier this year, I introduced the bipartisan Purple Heart Freedom to Work Act to ensure that combat-disabled veterans do not have to choose between returning to the workforce or keeping their benefits. Our veterans should be able to work freely in the country that they sacrificed to protect without losing any benefit that they are entitled to. Happy birthday to the world\u2019s best Coast Guard. The double standard is baffling to me. How can the justice system recommend a plea deal for Hunter Biden but continue to pursue President Trump this way? It\u2019s like we are in an authoritarian state. Biden is intentionally misinterpreting legislation so he can push his anti-gun agenda and withhold funding from schools with hunting and archery programs. This is a direct attack on rural America and the Second Amendment. The bipartisan NDAA is critical for our nation\u2019s defense and for supporting our service personnel, military retirees, military installations, and defense industry in Georgia. House passage of this legislation also furthers my effort to prevent DOD funds from purchasing and using technology produced by our adversaries. It is ridiculous that the Secret Service wants us to believe that, even with the FBI\u2019s help, they can\u2019t identify a suspect who brought cocaine into the most secure building in the world. Why would you close the investigation in less than a week if you wanted to know who did it? Our DOD dollars should never be used to purchase CCP battery technology, and I introduced amendments in the NDAA to prohibit that from happening. I joined as the House debates the NDAA this week. Watch here: The CCP is not our friend, and we cannot be naive to their intentions with business in the U.S. I joined to discuss Secretary Yellen\u2019s recent visit to China and more. Watch here: Our law enforcement officers risk their lives to protect us, and we lost one of our own in during a traffic stop earlier today. My family and I are praying for the family of the fallen deputy and for the Crisp County law enforcement community. Happy of July! It is a blessing to live in this great nation, and I am thankful for the many men and women who fight to keep our nation the land of the free. For decades Moody AFB has been key for our nation\u2019s defense and I am pleased that Secretary Kendall has selected Moody as the preferred location for the Joint Strike Fighter. Moody is proud to maintain a fighter mission, carrying its strong legacy long into the century. Russia has a long history of deception operations, and we are still learning about recent events with the Wagner group. As this situation unfolds, the US will continue to support Ukraine. Georgia is critical for our military\u2019s readiness, and I reintroduced an amendment in the NDAA to keep the Combat Readiness Training Center open in Savannah, GA. I joined John Solomon to discuss the HASC passage of the NDAA, and more. Watch here: Late last night, passed the bipartisan NDAA. This legislation recognizes the global impact that Georgia\u2019s bases have on our nation\u2019s defense and supports our warfighters around the globe. As our adversaries display increasingly aggressive behavior, I am proud to have amendments included to counter the influence of dangerous countries like Russia and Communist China. As someone from a rural district, I understand that rural economies cannot survive without a thriving agriculture industry. This is why lawmakers on both sides of the aisle must work to pass a supportive Farm Bill this year. Today is Juneteenth, where we recognize the freedoms won for enslaved people across the United States over years ago. I want to wish a happy Father\u2019s Day to all of our Eighth District dads. I will be enjoying the day with my family, and I hope y\u2019all get to do the same! In Congress declared June Flag Day as the national day of observance for the American flag. The flag is a symbol of freedom and liberty to the American people. We honor the flag to stand behind those protecting these freedoms and serving this great country. Happy Birthday to the U.S. Army! For years, our soldiers have been defending and protecting this great nation. We are extremely grateful for their service. This is not about any individual or even the Speaker- it\u2019s about governing. As I\u2019ve said before, we cannot govern when of the conference intentionally creates controversy to try to dictate what the other do. We need to get spending in this country under control, and the recent Fiscal Responsibility Act was the first step toward cutting government overspending. I joined to discuss: There can be no double standard regarding the mishandling of classified materials. Unless the indictment of Trump is politically motivated, the DOJ will apply the same standard to other government officials who illegally had classified documents, and more indictments will follow. Remembering the heroes of D-Day, which was years ago today. The Communist Chinese Navy is very mistaken if they think they can intimidate ships of the U.S. Armed Forces operating in international waters. The U.S. will not be intimidated by the CCP- and it is past time for corporate America to cut ties with them. I voted for the Fiscal Responsibility Act last night not because it was perfect, but because it was necessary and cut spending. My statement on the Fiscal Responsibility Act: I wish everyone a happy and safe Memorial Day with friends and family! While many of us will enjoy the liberties afforded to us in this great country today, let us all not forget to reflect on the sacrifices it took to earn them. Today, SCOTUS sided with our farmers and ranchers, who rely on clear and reasonable regulatory guidance from government agencies, by protecting them from the EPA\u2019s weaponization of the Clean Water Act. Now it\u2019s time for Biden\u2019s EPA to rescind their flawed WOTUS rule. Local authorities seized enough fentanyl in my home county to kill over people earlier this year. That's why I supported the Halt Fentanyl Act today to keep this dangerous drug out of our streets. The current situation with the X-Date and the debt limit is a calculated political maneuver by Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer. We were already at of the statutory debt limit when Biden signed the Omnibus in December. This is intentional; they knew exactly what they were doing. Negotiations on the debt limit should have started in December when we were at We asked again and again, but Biden refused. Finally less than days prior to a default, Biden agreed to negotiate. No House Republican wants a default. The President falsely claimed that this bipartisan bill \u201cbets against American innovation.\u201d His veto only benefits the CCP. Maybe he was too blinded by his woke climate agenda to actually read the bill. Durham proved once and for all that the Democrats weaponized the FBI to launch a sham investigation into Donald Trump for their own political gain. Everyone involved should face consequences. Terrorists and foreign adversaries are taking advantage of Biden's open border every day, and we are paying for it. Imagine who has been able to slip by authorities during the surge. Robins Air Force Base recently welcomed its first ever airborne communications relay plane, or \"BACN,\" one of the four mission sets slated to replace JSTARS. This new mission showcases the global impact Robins AFB plays in our nation\u2019s defense. Wishing all our Eighth District mothers \u2013 including my mom and my wife Vivien \u2013 a very happy Mother\u2019s Day! The crisis at the border is a result of Biden's failed policies, and now that Title is lifted, it will only get worse. I joined to discuss this national security disaster. Watch here: Over million illegal immigrants have crossed the border since Biden took office, creating tremendous fiscal challenges. Biden is giving them education, housing, and transportation, which are free to them but not to us. American taxpayers are paying for all of these things at the federal, state, and local levels. This simply must be stopped. As an avid turkey hunter, I appreciate efforts to promote the national turkey population and support my favorite sport. Today I introduced legislation to commemorate their anniversary along with and With of our nation\u2019s food supply coming from approximately of our nation\u2019s producers, there\u2019s no question that food security is national security and a strong farm safety net is a top priority in the next Farm Bill. Looking forward to hearing from producers today: We honor our veterans\u2019 service and sacrifice with honesty and integrity, two things that you, Mr. President, know nothing about. You spent Trillion without a single Republican vote. Bankrupting America doesn\u2019t honor our veterans\u2019 service and sacrifice. You have neither shame nor dignity, but you and your family do have a bunch of money from China. Happy National Pecan Day! Georgia is the largest pecan producing state in the United States, which in turn is the world\u2019s largest pecan exporter. Easter is a time to rejoice and be thankful. This Easter Sunday, we are reminded of the sacrifice made for us on the cross and the assurance of salvation and redemption. He is risen! The left is just trying to embarrass Donald Trump. This is about politics for them, not about the law. Whether you like Trump or not, you should be worried that the Democratic Party is weaponizing the judicial system for political purposes. The Constitution means nothing to them. President Biden made his opposition to American energy clear the moment he took office. HR reverses Biden's misguided policies and produces more energy here at home. Today I supported HR and I will always stand up for American energy dominance. In order to protect America, we need to make sure that technology purchased by the DoD is not from Communist China. I asked Defense Secretary Austin what steps are being taken to purge DoD\u2019s supply chain of technology from the CCP. Thank you to all veterans who bravely served in Vietnam. Today we honor your service and welcome you home. Combat-disabled veterans should be able to freely work in the country that they sacrificed to protect without losing the SSDI benefits that they are entitled to. Thank you to our original cosponsors: As of now, the Farm Bill is projected to spend less than to support production agriculture while of it goes to SNAP. I asked USDA Secretary Vilsack if he supports such a low percentage going to commodity support programs. The CCP is an adversary of the US, and there is more and more bipartisan support for taking action against Chinese aggression each day. They do not share American interests or values. I appreciate for his leadership on this legislation which will help us better understand emerging technologies like #blockchain, and for his continued focus to promote public policy that fosters, rather than inhibits, growth of #FinTech in the United States.", "The IRS will offer in-person help to taxpayers in Philadelphia this Saturday, April from a.m. to p.m., at Arch St. More information: Happy Black Maternal Health Week!

The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (H.R. now goes to the Senate.", "This is your regular reminder that when Democrats tried *twice* to keep Roe v. Wade as the law of the land every single republican in Congress voted no. Remember it. Wow today a group comprising of republicans in Congress explicitly endorsed a far-right bill that would impose a national abortion ban and outlaw birth control and in vitro fertilization IVF. Read for yourself The republican party\u2019s record is so awful many people don\u2019t believe it until they see it with their own eyes. Take a look Here\u2019s a recent clip of donald trump bragging again about destroying Roe v. Wade and calling women\u2019s freedom an \u201catrocity\u201d Icymi a new investigation recently found donald trump took almost from foreign governments in office almost all of it from China Women\u2019s freedom is under threat coast to coast and Ukraine is under daily attack and this is what republicans are focusing on next week: laundry liberty and fridge freedom. Really. Pathetic With Pres Biden now forgiving billion in student debt reminder that every single republican in Congress voted to kill debt relief for nurses, teachers and other working Americans. There are now members calling for Congress to let us vote on Ukraine aid. We just need a few courageous republicans to join us to force a vote. Time is running out let us vote! Reminder that when Democrats acted to save Roe v. Wade every single republican in Congress voted no and voted to throw women and doctors in jail. I\u2019ve put together a supercut of every time donald trump has bragged about destroying Roe v. Wade (so far) Today we held a sham hearing on the corrupt Republican Tax Scam and I pushed back hard on all the lies about their cash giveaway to the super rich! Later today we are holding a sham hearing to discuss republicans\u2019 tax scam plans but last week donald trump summarized them in seconds flat: more tax cuts for millionaires!

Wishing you and your family well! It is unfortunate that in the midst of the Holiday season President Trump is forcing more than federal workers to continue on the job without pay. Hopefully, after quick reflection, the President and his enablers re-think this approach to funding the government. We reached an agreement on the final package of spending bills only to have Trump shut it down after Freedom Caucus members pushed him. A lot of this is part of Trump\u2019s efforts to change the narrative after Secretary Mattis\u2019 stunning resignation. The only adult in the room stepping down would have been more negative if Trump didn\u2019t engage in his art of deflection. This is no way to say thank you to our dedicated federal workforce. Americans deserve much better from the office of the President. . has (once again) brought us close to failing to fund the government. Americans need us to act responsibly. Congress reached a bipartisan compromise before Trump decided to pander to his base. Do your job Keep the government running. #TrumpShutdown I have always respected General Mattis for his four decades of service to our country and his commitment to reigning in the ridiculous defense policies pushed by and his . He was one of the few adults allowed in Trump\u2019s room. We wish him the best. Trump\u2019s unstable, disrespectful behavior and dangerous approach to governing continues to disgrace the office and undermine America\u2019s credibility. Our federal workers should not be faced with the threat of a shutdown after Congress reaches a bipartisan agreement. \u201cBut this is not your typical farm bill.

The last major government shutdown in cost the American economy nearly billion. and his enablers must realize that threatening a #TrumpShutdown is hardly in the spirit of the holiday season.

Great morning at the Lake Highlands th of July Parade! Great day to remember and celebrate the gift of freedom and American exceptionalism. Join & me on in just a few moments. Happy Birthday to my great friend, Mike Pence! We have two ominous events occurring because of failing entitlement programs. A new report from the Medicare trustees projects that the Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be depleted three years earlier than previously reported. Furthermore, for the first time in almost years, Social Security\u2019s cost will exceed its income. Both of these troubling reports are further evidence that as a nation we are continuing to spend money we do not have and we are passing the bill to future generations. My iPad continues to be awash with reports that our national debt is unsustainable. This is just one more sobering reminder \u2013 something that is unsustainable one day stops. There is only one solution and it is to reform entitlement programs for future beneficiaries. I strongly disagree with the decision to move forward with the implementation of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Mexico, Canada, and the EU under the guise of national security concerns. Protectionist policies typically are another version of crony capitalism with the government picking winners and losers. The Administration may be correct in claiming that the existing steel and aluminum tariffs have been helpful to some workers and jobs, but it\u2019s hurt other businesses that use these metals. It\u2019s going to be a tax on all consumers. There are not enough words to describe how grateful I am to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice serving our country in the military. I am always reminded that freedom is not free, and it certainly cannot be taken for granted. It is my sincere hope that you will take time to reflect upon the service of our fallen heroes. On this Memorial Day and every day, I ask that you join me in praying for those we have lost and their loved ones. #MemorialDay The Honda Accord is not a threat to our national security. However, taxing it with trade tariffs is a threat to the economic security of millions of hardworking American families. All of the great gains President Trump has made with generational tax relief and bureaucratic regulatory reforms \u2013 the reforms that are fueling our economy \u2013 can be wiped out overnight if we end up in a global trade war. I again call upon the President and his administration to exercise extreme caution and focus on the nation states that violate the actual trade rules and force transfers of our technology and intellectual property.

We are working together to put an end to these unchecked powers. @BCFPDirector The Trump Administration is taking a big step to protect life by aiming to prevent federal funding for groups like Planned Parenthood that have their family planning clinics under the same roof as their abortion clinics.

We must continue to provide more aid to Ukraine to ensure that it can defeat Russia\u2019s aggression and win this war. Ukraine, powered by the bravery of its soldiers and the strength of American arms, has made remarkable progress stopping and rolling back Russia\u2019s invasion. We must accelerate, not curtail, our support. I thank President Zelenskyy for speaking to Congress tonight and making the case for America to continue to support his country. An investment in Ukraine is an investment in security of our allies around the globe. Wrapped up my and final weekly #Ohio press call today.

There is no better way to celebrate than giving back to the Buckeye State! I am committed to keeping Ohioans safe and giving our men and women in uniform the resources they need to protect themselves. This year I fought to include a number of key priorities in the National Defense Authorization Act.

I am looking forward to the president signing this important legislation into law in order to better support our men and women in uniform. Congress must fund increased detention space for single adults as Title expires. Decreased detention space leads to poor policy decisions to release unlawful migrants, including those with criminal records, which only empowers human smugglers and traffickers. Under the Obama-Biden administration, (with then-Deputy ) increased detention space to deal with the border crisis. Today\u2019s border crisis is more than worse, but the current administration is trying to cut detention spaces. This is bad policy. Our Border Patrol is being overrun with thousands crossing the border unlawfully. The Biden admin must end their failed policies and take action to stop unlawful It was great to be with the Friends of the Joseph Barker Jr. House and other community members to commemorate the final transfer of the Barker House property from the Army Corps to the Friends group.

It was great to join the American Nationalities Movement yesterday in Parma, #Ohio to reflect on our work together over the last years advocating for several countries in Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine. I look forward to continuing our work together after my time in the Senate. It has been an honor and privilege to work with my friends from the United Ukrainian Organizations of Ohio advocating for Ukraine during this illegal war Russia and Vladimir Putin have waged on them. Americans are feeling the impacts this holiday season of irresponsible and excessive stimulus spending. This year, of consumers are expecting inflation to impact their holiday budget. In order to make life more affordable for working families, Congress must work together to stop excessive spending, unleash energy production, and promote pro-growth economic policies. Yesterday I delivered my Senate farewell speech. Almost years ago, I stood on the Senate floor for my maiden speech. I was new to the Senate but had a sense of what was possible to achieve for my constituents in #Ohio having served in the House and in two Cabinet-level jobs. Our country faces enormous challenges, whether it be our economy and record inflation, our national debt that is robbing future generations of Americans, the absence of any real border security and our broken immigration system, or the looming insolvency of entitlement programs. These issues won\u2019t be solved by one party running over the other and imposing its will on the country. They will only be solved by us working together in good faith. Today we remember the attack on Pearl Harbor years ago. More than servicemembers lost their lives. Today we honor and remember their sacrifice for our country. As I said in a March HSGAC hearing, we know that billions of $$ in funding has been stolen by transnational criminal orgs in countries like #China & Russia, many of whom used fraudulent schemes to exploit the pandemic for their own financial gain. A report from verifies that CCP sponsored hackers stole millions in benefits meant to help Americans. This is just one more reason why Congress should prioritize protecting our institutions from the Chinese government. Inflation caused by the Democrats\u2019 reckless spending are effecting every aspect of American\u2019s lives. This Christmas season of consumers expect inflation to impact their holiday shopping budgets. We must work together to make life more affordable for working Americans, and I urge the Biden admin to get back to pro-growth, common-sense economic policies that were helping small businesses prior to the pandemic. Congress has delivered bipartisan results to invest in American competitiveness and strengthen our communities. However, this Congress has been unable to reach agreement on one important topic: removing trade barriers & strengthening trade enforcement. Read more in my op-ed with for here: Prices have risen since the day took office. For consecutive months, CPI inflation has remained at a high, above The key drivers of rising CPI were the rising costs of: gas, rent, electricity, and groceries. Instead of more taxes and spending, we should work together to pursue common-sense economic policies like those Republicans put in place before the pandemic which produced low unemployment, significant job gains, and record wage growth. Best of luck to #USA\u2019s as they take on the Netherlands today in round of the ! Congress should absolutely pass a bipartisan trade package before the end of the year in order to strengthen American competitiveness and help American workers. Read about my bipartisan trade proposal with that I am urging Congress to pass in below. Lastly, a bipartisan trade compromise should reauthorize the GSP and MTB programs which while small have major benefits for small businesses and American manufacturers. #jobs Congress has had almost two years to pass trade legislation and has so far come up short. That\u2019s unacceptable. Let\u2019s get this done. It was an honor to join the #Ohio Jewish Communities this morning and discuss how Congress can better protect our religious institutions and support Jewish communities in #Ohio and across the United States. I have worked closely with the #Ohio Jewish Communities to advocate and defend Israel and it\u2019s been a pleasure to work with the Jewish community throughout my time in the Senate. I was honored to receive the Star of Ukraine award from today. During my time in the Senate, I have been proud to stand with the people of #Ukraine in their fight for freedom since the Revolution of Dignity. As #Ukraine continues to fight off Russia\u2019s brutal assault, the U.S. cannot let up in our support. We continue to provide the tools that #Ukraine\u2019s brave defenders need to win this war. Last night, I spoke on the Senate floor for the consecutive session week to discuss Russia\u2019s brutal and unprovoked attack on the people of #Ukraine. I am encouraged by the success of the Ukrainian taking place. Aid from the U.S. has greatly assisted Ukraine\u2019s position and has enabled Ukraine\u2019s forces to liberate cities and save civilians from Russian authority. At this crucial time, the West must continue to support #Ukraine in its time of need. Congress must do its part to hold Russia accountable and send the unmistakable signal to Putin and the rest of the world that the U.S. stands with #Ukraine. During my recent visit to #Ukraine, I heard heroic stories of Ukrainian civilians standing up to Russian invaders against overwhelming odds. I also met with Ukrainian leaders to discuss the importance of U.S. assistance and the impact it is having on the battlefield. Earlier this fall, in response to my questioning, TikTok\u2019s COO refused to commit to cutting off all data & metadata flows to China. Now a ByteDance Risk Assessment says it is not possible for the company to keep \u201csensitive and/or regulated data\u201d from China The ByteDance Risk Assessment also says TikTok is not reporting correct info to government agencies. This is outrageous. Soaring inflation, slowing economic growth, and a looming recession is partly the product of months of Democrat mishandling and refusal to work in a bipartisan way to grow the economy. The U.S. economy grew at a rate year-to-date and Americans are facing nearly year high inflation. The Republican\u2019s pre-pandemic trend of economic growth expected that growth would\u2019ve continued at a annual rate. Americans need a change, and I urge the Biden admin to work with Republicans to get back to pro-growth, common-sense economic policies. Thanks to the amazing resolve of the Ukrainian people and assistance from the U.S. and its allies, #Ukraine is liberating its sovereign territory from the unprovoked, illegal and brutal Russian invasion. It\u2019s important that the U.S. and our allies continue to supply #Ukraine with what it needs to win this war, including longer range missiles to be able to reach the Russian launching pads stop the deadly Russian attacks on civilians. As well as better air defense systems to knock the Russian missiles out of the sky.", "A huge step in putting Biden\u2019s rule will shore up the reforms made in the Inflation Reduction Act to make sure taxpayers don't have to foot the bill for Big Oil's messes.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law I helped pass delivers million to replace the Sausalito ferry dock, improving safety & reliability for the folks who depend on our ferry system. I had some fun visitors last week in DC \u2013 students from Hillcrest Middle School! I always enjoy meeting with our future leaders and answering their thoughtful questions about the work I'm doing in Congress. When power-hungry extremists are exposed, they go on the attack. What\u2019s happening to Schwalb is the exact same playbook Project and the alt-right have used on anyone who dares to challenge them \u2013 including . There is really shocking reporting here on this coordinated campaign against the DC Attorney General (because he is simply doing his job) and how MAGA Republicans all the way up to Congress are wielding their power to intimidate and obstruct. After securing more than for Community Projects in the first tranche of funding bills, I\u2019m happy to say that my remaining projects have passed the House \u2013 meaning over MILLION will soon be on its way to our district for fantastic projects led by my constituents! Clean water is a basic human right \u2013 but MAGA Republicans are trying to limit access to that basic need. Yesterday they passed a bill undermining the Clean Water Act. But I\u2019ll keep working on sustainable solutions to make sure every community has safe, clean water. #WorldWaterDay Last Congress, invested billions in our local communities to lower energy bills, create millions of jobs, and hold Big Oil accountable. is trying to stop that money before it reaches our communities\u2014all in the interest of their polluter friends. While cater to the interests of oil and gas firms during their so-called \"Energy Week,\" folks in America are suffering the consequences of the #ClimateCrisis and their environmental destruction. I am voting NO to their giveaways to fossil fuel companies. Why are we debating a bill to gut the Clean Water Act during Republicans' \"Energy Week\"? Well, because Team Extreme's week has nothing to do with actual energy or clean water policies \u2013 it's all just part of their Polluters Over People agenda. Enough with this gaslighting. In the face of extreme MAGA Republican attempts to ban abortion nationwide, House Democrats are united in the fight to restore abortion access nationwide and ensure that women have access to the health care they need. India's shrimp industry is rife with unsafe labor practices, human rights abuses, and contaminated products. And the U.S. is unwittingly supporting this, because that seafood is ending up in American stores, restaurants, and our dinner plates. I'm grateful this whistleblower bravely went public with what's happening at Choice Canning., , and I have requested this trove of information. We're going to make sure the U.S. holds corporations responsible & combats IUU. Human rights abuses in the seafood supply chain stretch to all corners of the earth. There's new bombshell reporting on what\u2019s happening in the shrimp industry \u2013 thanks to this whistleblower and and 's Outlaw Ocean Project's work.

Another month of strong job numbers! Nearly million jobs created Unemployment below for straight months, an over record Wages rising & inflation slowing Historic economic growth thanks to Biden and Democrats. Project is a horrifying manifesto, undeniably designed to dismantle democracy to force everyone in the US to submit to extreme religious beliefs. Anyone who can still say Christian Nationalism isn\u2019t a threat has their head in the sand. We NEED to be talking more about this. Another important note: Brave journalists like are pulling back the curtain on the shadow campaign of Christian Nationalism. But the movement\u2019s powerful operatives will stop at nothing to intimidate & discredit anyone who gets in their way. One of the most important things we can do to protect basic rights & secular democracy is to join together and fight Christian Nationalism. My #SOTU guest, 's , is my fearless partner in this, & I could not be more honored to have her join me tonight. If Team Extreme\u2019s inability to pass government funding bills wasn\u2019t proof enough, their \u201cwildlife conservation\u201d bill we considered in shows the GOP doesn\u2019t understand how appropriating money works (a basic function of government). So let me break it down quickly: For any additional wildlife funding to happen under this bill, the money would have to be specifically APPROPRIATED by a future Congress. This messy bill doesn\u2019t bother to do it, so the million referenced in this bill is essentially just Monopoly money. Thanks for the Bruce Bucks, \u2013 but what we actually need is real funding, like in \u2019s RAWA. That bipartisan, thoughtful bill is a serious attempt to conserve wildlife, (with REAL money) and that\u2019s what we should have been considering today. I've worked with for years to shed light on Christian Nationalism. Partnerships between religious and nonreligious advocates like ours are critical in the fight to keep this dangerous ideology from overrunning our govt. I\u2019m honored to have her as my #SOTU guest. Yesterday, I visited Bolinas and met with local community reps working to bring back the Bolinas Post Office. This is a high priority for me and my staff, and we'll continue to work with federal & local leaders to find a long term solution to restore USPS operations to Bolinas. Trump spent his time in office eroding religious freedom. Biden has finally withdrawn all of the Trump admin\u2019s odious faith-based regulations, restoring protections for folks using social services from religious persecution. Last week, I stopped by the Bodega Bay Fire Station to meet with our local firefighters who work day in and day out to keep the North Coast safe. Thank you for all you do for our community! The threat of wildfires is only growing as climate change accelerates\u2014and we need tools to protect communities. I helped secure another from \u2019 Inflation Reduction Act & Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to increase Trinity County\u2019s fire resiliency. Happy Leap Day! Great piece. The GOP has become inseparable bedfellows with Christian Nationalism, but let me reassure you: there are politicians (like me and my Freethought Caucus members) who've been deeply concerned for years and doing all we can to protect separation of church and state. Absurd. Republicans are using the Endangered Species Act as a scapegoat in their relentless campaign to ban abortions. They don\u2019t care about endangered species or environmental justice\u2014they\u2019re just throwing everything at the wall to control women\u2019s bodies. It was great to join Supervisor Hopkins for visit with local fishermen to discuss the challenges impacting their industry. Looking forward to continuing our work together and finding ways I can help on the federal level. Had a great visit at Ukiah\u2019s School of Performing Arts & Cultural Education. It was a pleasure to tour the campus, learn about their exceptional programs, and present them with a congressional certificate. Keep up the great work! When religious extremists dictate policy, all of our rights are at risk. The power of Christian Nationalism on a State Supreme Court is a horrifying incursion into women's rights that is ruining lives. We have to stop this. Bolinas-Fairfax Road is a vital artery for locals, recreation, & responders\u2014but the onslaught of storms caused massive damage we can\u2019t ignore. Dems secured historic funding for infrastructure, and I\u2019ll keep pushing to direct that $$ to this project. The glitch in the new FAFSA system is hurting students in my district and across the US. I\u2019m glad responded to my calls for a fix with this temporary process\u2014but we need a permanent solution to make sure these inequities are completely behind us. Full guidance on how to submit your FAFSA while the Ed Department works on fully resolving this issue can be found here The GOP\u2019s latest sop to the fossil fuel industry is as transparently dishonest as it gets. In an effort to fast-track dirty energy projects, they\u2019re throwing environmental justice communities under the bus and completely ignoring the climate crisis. Let's do some fact checking:We\u2019re the world's largest LNG exporter & already on track to double it. So no, we don\u2019t need more facilitiesNew facilities will actually INCREASE the cost of our energy pricesOur allies are not asking for this. They want clean energy, not LNG We\u2019re up against the clock with govt funding, national security, & aiding allies\u2014 things the GOP won\u2019t let us vote on. We shouldn't be wasting time and sacrificing communities at the altar of Big Oil with these attempts to reverse a smart decision that puts people over politics. I\u2019ve said from the start that Mike Johnson is a dangerous Christian Nationalist. I\u2019m calling out his egregious violations of church-state separation \u2013 otherwise we\u2019re all going to be frogs in the pot of boiling water that leads to theocracy. Speaker Johnson used Congress as a platform for a Christian Nationalist pastor who fueled Jan and preaches hate against Jews, Muslims, LGBTQ+ people, and others. He\u2019s spitting in the face of church/state separation and complete disregard for America\u2019s diversity. Great news here for the future of the Klamath Basin! This partnership along with the significant investments from and are another example of our commitment to a solution that benefits the wildlife, tribes, communities, and economies. Upgrades are coming to NorCal\u2019s airports! Thanks to Biden and Democrats\u2019 Investing in America agenda, airports serving our district are getting new federal funding to improve accessibility, safety, and sustainability. Climate change is decimating ecosystems, and many tribes in my district have taken up initiatives to restore these precious landscapes. Four of these great projects just got funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help them in this important work. Speaker Johnson wielded his power to move the National Prayer Breakfast to the heart of the Capitol\u2014turning a Christian service into a govt-run, taxpayer-funded event. As a non-believer fighting to protect church/state separation, I had to see it for myself. Here\u2019s my experience: Read my full statement on tonight\u2019s cynical stunt by House Republicans and the urgent need to pass a serious supplemental package", "I am now accepting applications for Service Academy nominations.

My hope is that with Brunson \u2019s release we can begin the process of healing between our two nations and ultimately strengthening relationships with a crucial regional ally.For now, we can take a moment to reflect on the successful efforts that resulted in his freedom & rejoice with his family, while bearing in mind that there are still others in similar circumstances who remain incarcerated. #PastorBrunson A record low unemployment rate of is a great way to kick off There are over job openings in America\u2019s manufacturing industry. That\u2019s why manufacturers are opening their doors today to inspire students to pursue opportunities in manufacturing. Dr. Lederman cemented America\u2019s leadership role in physics at Fermilab. Not only did he realize the beauty of what he did in his work \u2013 something seen throughout the lab with its architecture and design \u2013 but the work he did inspiring the next generation of young scientists and researchers may perhaps be his most lasting legacy. It is with sadness that we mark his passing, but his legacy will live on with the international work we are convening at Fermilab and at every Saturday Morning Physics lecture for students. Thank you for championing this important legislation in the senate! Thank you @divita. We need integrated care for Medicare beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease. I stand with my colleague calling for cooperation and swift action so we can deliver for our veterans. Thank you for welcoming me to your McHenry facility! I enjoyed answering questions from folks who live and work in the District, and the production tour enabled me to see firsthand the great work being done there.

Our nation\u2019s veterans have sacrificed too much for us to turn a blind eye to their dental needs \u2013 Congress needs to pass H. R. to give veterans access to dental care. #VeteransCare It was an honor to join the USO today at a \u201cForce Behind the Forces\u201d event to assemble care packages for military spouses! Grateful for the USO\u2019s Salute to Military Spouses, its six-month spotlight on military spouse contributions and challenges. We have a profound obligation to our vets & need a bipartisan approach to ensure they're provided the care they deserve. I am pleased to support The Burn Pits Accountability Act, introduced by vets, Reps. Gabbard & Mast, who know the effects of burn pits On this Overdose Awareness Day, we remember the lives lost to the opioid epidemic - and recommit to passing an opioid package before Congress adjourns. Privileged to visit Midwest Groundcover yesterday, an impressive local District business. While visiting, I had the great honor of receiving the Guardian of Small Business Award for outstanding support of small business owners in the Congress. The fabric of our nation is literally woven with the ambition and hope of and the recognition that anyone, from any background, can innovate, persevere and build a business. #startupweek Congratulations to on it\u2019s grand opening of the state of the art Liebman Science Center! Outrageous- I stand with demanding his release. These dire statistics reaffirm the importance of addressing the opioid crisis as a top priority for this fall.

Just kicked off the Wauconda town hall! We are holding this week! Looking forward to discussions with constituents! Pastor Andrew Brunson has been wrongly imprisoned by Turkey since October I wholeheartedly support the new sanctions placed on Turkey and welcome increased pressure on that nation to return Pastor Brunson to his wife and three children immediately. A habitual human rights violator and state sponsor of terrorism, Iran deserves sanctions for failed promises and aggression. Continued pressure on rogue actors delivers a strong message to terror sponsors around the world - and will contribute to a continued reduction in terror. New tariffs on Russia - a necessary and critical step to keep the pressure on Putin and Russia to stop their malign activities. Readiness is paramount to peace by strength. Our active duty troops need the best, and it up to Congress to provide them with the tools they need to carry out the mission. I look forward to bolstering the available resources for soldiers overseas and veterans at home this fall. We need to do all we can for our veterans. These brave men and women have earned it. If you are a veteran and need assistance with the VA or any other agency, we are here to help. My website lists resources - #WoundedWarrior #PurpleHeart It was long overdue for our military men and women to see an increase in their wages. This raise was a priority of mine in Congress to make sure these patriots are fairly compensated for their service and sacrifice to our nation. Grateful for the opportunity to speak at the awards ceremony at the McHenry County Fair in Woodstock. Congrats to all these great young people! What an asset to have in our state!

And we still have leaders who will uphold the values that made America great, and a beacon to the oppressed.\u201d As we gather at the Capitol to say our goodbyes today, may we always remember his example of public service and living a life with love and honor. Farewell, Senator. Senator McCain embodied service, honor and patriotism. He showed us how to be principled and strong while also being decent and respectful. Our prayers are with the Senator and his family. May this good man find eternal peace and serenity, for he has surely earned it. Prayers for Senator McCain and his family This Administration just has it completely backwards when it comes to gun safety. This effort by Trump/DeVos goes against the intent of bipartisan legislation passed in Congress this year. If they move forward with this plan, Congress should step in and protect students from the consequences of this policy. There\u2019s a lot we should do to make our kids safer at school, but using federal funds to bring guns into classrooms isn\u2019t one of them. Today\u2019s conviction of Manafort is yet more evidence that the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not a witch hunt and that it must be allowed to continue without interference. Cities, states, and responsible members of Congress alike must do everything we can to stop this assault on our environment and public health Every American should be alarmed by what this White House is doing. President Trump doesn\u2019t want to just ignore climate change, he wants to make things worse \u2013 this is going to impact our economy, public health and national security. To all celebrating - Eid Mubarak! In today\u2019s world, we certainly need more of what Aretha Franklin taught us \u2013 RESPECT. May we celebrate her leadership on female empowerment and cherish her music for generations to come. God Bless the Queen of Soul. We know that foreign adversaries are trying to undermine our elections and we know that we have We have to take this threat more seriously. Last month I introduced bill that would block foreign ownership and control of elections systems. Proud to have introduced the Children and Media Research Advancement (CAMRA) Act in the House. Bipartisan Bicameral Reality once again proving that the argument that the GOP tax cuts would pay for themselves was completely untrue Last week I was proud to introduce legislation with , @RepTedBudd, and others to authorize research at on technology and media\u2019s impacts on infants, children, and adolescents. Read about the bill here: It's almost like the climate is changing and that this change will have major consequences, including ones that will also limit productivity and economic activity. We cannot allow untraceable and unregistered guns \u2013 especially without any safeguards or background checks. It\u2019s inviting tragedy. I fully support making Maryland a leader on this issue and the work of other AGs across the nation to I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which would extend these vital policies while also making important enhancements to address wider forms of sexual violence. Sexual and domestic violence affects more than in women in the United States, and funding for local law enforcement training and violence prevention programs is essential to helping women lead safer lives. This is a perfect example of serious legislation that deserves bipartisan support, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle work quickly to enact this into law. Today is the court-ordered deadline for the Trump Administration to that's been detailed w/ their parents. It's widely reported the Administration won't meet this deadline, in part because hundreds of parents have already been deported without their children. Despite what the and might claim, this remains a #humanitarian #Crisis that they caused, that they have not solved, and that fundamentally betrayed our #Values and moral standing in the world. This should have never happened and it should bring shame to all of us that it was done in our government\u2019s name. Delaney, Budd, Markey, Sasse, Introduce Bipartisan, Bicameral Legislation to Study Impact of Technology and Media on Children The most effective way to combat climate change is to put a price on carbon. My floor speech: Trade wars are not good and they are not easy to win. The House is in session this week. Here's what we're scheduled to vote on: Delaney, Harris Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Protect Elections Systems from Foreign Ownership and Control Today, I voted against a House Republican resolution attacking the idea of a #CarbonTax. Putting a price on carbon is one of the most effective tools we have, which is why I went to the floor to speak out against the latest effort to deny #climate #Science and block #innovation. Last week the FBI informed MD officials that a firm used by the state for voter registration, election night results etc has ties to a Russian oligarch close to Putin. I'm introducing legislation to block foreign ownership & control of election systems. It\u2019s alarming that so much of our elections systems could be controlled by foreign-owned entities. This legislation will prevent this from happening again. Our election systems are targets of attacks, and we must take steps to harden and protect our democratic institutions. The integrity and security of our elections transcends partisanship and I thank Congressman Andy Harris for working with me on this important legislation. The House is in session this week. Here's a list of the bills the Speaker is bringing to the floor for a vote Instead of defending our nation, our intelligence community, and our democracy our sided with the leader of the nation who attacked America\u2019s electoral process. . & to File Bipartisan Legislation to Block Foreign Ownership and Control of U.S. Election Systems Delaney Statement on President Trump\u2019s Remarks in Helsinki Not a witch I was truly shocked to see Mayor Bruchey's comments about London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan. Mayor Khan is global advocate for equality and has guided his city through numerous actual terrorist attacks with strength and class. He has seen what terrorism can do firsthand, so to call him that is unacceptable and just plain wrong. We are given an amazing privilege to serve the public and should do so with civility and dignity. I encourage all elected officials to engage in civil and respectful debate... But those disagreements and the battle of different ideas should strengthen us. They should never lead to personal and inappropriate attacks like this, especially with our allies. If we do that, we lose everything. Today, the #Maryland delegation observed a moment of silence on the House floor for the victims of the #CapitalGazette shooting in #Annapolis. Since December it's the time we've done so due to gun violence. THE. FORTY. NINTH. TIME. #EnoughIsEnough #NeverAgain Had a wonderful time this morning on the panel with @HurdOnTheHill and Rashida Richardson. Thank you to for the invitation and putting on a great show.", "Trump's move to end a scheduled fed pay increase is cynical and another attack on federal employees. I joined @WhipHoyer in urging Congress to support a pay Sorry, you lose the right to complain about partisanship once you've fanned the flames of violent insurrection. Ukraine is running out of time and ammunition. Putin's is knocking on Europe's door. And what is the Republican-led House choosing to focus on next week? Dishwashers and refrigerators. This will save lives. Thank you, , for never backing down in the fight against gun violence. To everyone celebrating in and beyond \u2013 Eid Mubarak! If Speaker Johnson puts Ukraine aid on the floor for a vote, he wouldn't be doing us a favor. He would be be doing his job. You don't get extra credit for doing your job. Put the bill on the floor, and let the House work its will. Let's be perfectly clear \u2013 this kind of draconian decision can only happen because Roe v. Wade is not in place. Donald Trump did this. What a day for Team Connolly\u2019s annual staff retreat! It was great to be in Reston this morning for the Annual Founder\u2019s Day! Reston is a testament to the power of a big idea and the fortitude and persistence to see it through. Looking forward to many more years of celebrating this visionary community! I continue to be horrified by the situation in Gaza. Right now, our focus must be on significantly increasing humanitarian aid to those who need it and securing a ceasefire as part of a deal to bring the hostages home. Some Republicans want to rename Dulles International Airport after Donald Trump., , and I think the \"Donald J. Trump Federal Correctional Institution\" has a better ring to it. Another banner month for the Biden economy! new jobs added in March with unemployment ticking down to Our economy has gained more than million jobs under President Biden \u2014 the fastest job growth in history. Great to meet with so many friends from Action this morning! Proud as always to stand with you in the fight against gun violence in America. Today, NATO celebrates years. The Alliance is bigger and stronger than ever. We remain committed to democracy, peace, and prosperity in all NATO countries. There are some who want the United States to abandon NATO, world history\u2019s most successful alliance. This would strengthen our adversaries and weaken our ability to meet the threats posed by Russia and China. As the former President of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I know firsthand that NATO remains the indispensable Alliance and the United States remains the indispensable Ally. Here's to more years of peace across NATO territory. Thank you to for having me speak at your annual Politics & Pancakes breakfast! It\u2019s always great to be here with so many advocates and elected officials. Today, the Biden administration released its final rule to protect the civil service from politicization. I applaud them for their commitment to protecting the merit-based civil service and preventing a return to Donald Trump\u2019s disastrous Schedule F proposal. We must build on this important step with legislation that ensures no future president can take office and replace dedicated civil servants with an army of political loyalists. I will continue to fight for passage of my bipartisan Saving the Civil Service Act, the only permanent solution to a problem that is not going away any time soon. My full statement: Heads up, I worked hard with the Biden admin to get this done, and I'm so excited to see it come to life. This level of coverage will be lifechanging for so many federal employees looking to start or build families on their own terms. Next up: expanding these benefits to even more plans. Donald Trump is facing felony charges. If Republicans want to name something after him, I\u2019d suggest they find a federal prison. The deaths of seven World Central Kitchen volunteers bringing food to desperately hungry Palestinians is an abhorrent act of indiscriminate bombing by Israeli Defense Forces. It is indefensible and a further dark chapter for the Netanyahu government. Mike Johnson wouldn't be doing us a favor by bringing Ukraine aid up for a vote. He would be doing his job. You don't get bonus points for doing your job. Lots to discuss on this beautiful Easter Sunday with on ! Check out our full conversation: Today, on we celebrate the trans community and their many contributions to American society.

Instead, he is still held captive at the hands of Vladimir Putin along with other Americans like Paul Whelan. Today, on the anniversary of Evan's captivity, we say loud and clear: It was great to visit in Tysons this morning to talk about how advances in technology can improve the depth and quality of healthcare and address the security clearance backlog! Thank you to the Tysons Rotary for having me speak at your meeting this morning! As an honorary rotarian, I\u2019m committed to following the four way pledge in my work on the Hill. Is there any desecration worse than Donald J. Trump hawking bibles during Holy Week? Maybe throw in his new sneakers, too. So thrilled to help announce million in federal funds to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay! These dollars will fund projects to ensure the Bay remains a treasure for generations to come. FACT: Mifepristone has been proven to be safe & effective for years. FACT: The GOP is fighting to strip away access to abortion care by any means.

Thank you to all of the volunteer fire and rescue members who put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe! years ago, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Since then, the percentage of uninsured Americans has been cut in half. One of the proudest votes of my career. So glad I had the chance to sit down with for a great conversation on all things postal as we approach the second anniversary of the Postal Service Reform Act. Have a listen Republicans aren\u2019t just telling you who they are, they are shouting it from the rooftops. Believe them. Tomorrow, the House will avert a shutdown. But our to do list is long, and it starts with Ukraine. Sooner or later, Speaker Johnson is going to have to actually act with some courage and bring a robust Ukraine aid bill to the floor. We cannot abandon the Ukrainian people now. With reproductive care under attack, I want to ensure you have easy access to resources and information about your rights.

Ukraine is at a crossroads in its fight for survival against Putin\u2019s brutality. Shame on us if we abandon the Ukrainian people now. I support the discharge petition that would force a vote on the Senate security package, and I look forward to adding my name to it. Unknown to most Americans, there's a tragedy quietly playing out across our country. Over the last three years, at least people have been killed in crashes involving trucks contracted by the Postal Service. USPS must do better. My OpEd in : On #EqualPayDay, we recommit ourselves to ensuring pay equity for all workers. Across the country, women make less than their male counterparts for doing the same job. Congress must finally pass the to right this historic wrong. Three years ago, and passed the American Rescue Plan. million Americans now pay less for health insurance. million more are newly employed. Our economy is the strongest in the world, and every single House Republican voted to prevent it. From badly-needed pay increases to protecting the civil service from politicization, there are a lot of issues facing the federal workforce today. I sat down with Federal News Network to discuss it all. Have a listen: Ramadan Mubarak to all who observe in and across the US! Wishing you a blessed and meaningful holy month. Today I had the honor of speaking at the Annual Fairfax County Student Peace Awards! It\u2019s inspiring to hear about these awardees\u2019 efforts to promote and foster peace in their communities. These students give me hope for our future. Congratulations to this year\u2019s inductees to the Northern Virginia Football Hall of Fame! Always great to be here to celebrate these talented athletes from our community. On we reflect on the many disparities facing women and the work we have done to level the playing field. Our commitment to gender equity is absolute, and I will not stop fighting until every person enjoys truly equal rights. An expanded CTC will not only lift millions of children out of poverty, it will allow millions of women to return to the workforce. We have already seen these results from the and my colleagues and I are committed to cementing these historic gains. Congressional Democrats and the Biden-Harris Administration are fighting to make generational change for women across the country. In the face of countless attacks from the right, we will not back down. Women's rights are human rights, on International Women's Day and every day. Another month, another incredible jobs report. Thanks, . Republicans: Biden\u2019s speech was too loud and partisan! Also Republicans: Honored to have Barb Collura, President of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, with me to watch deliver the State of the Union tonight. Barb is leading the fight for access to IVF, and her presence here will send a powerful message.

Addressing the need for more affordable housing is critical for the families in Fairfax County, and I\u2019ll continue to be a champion for our efforts in Congress. With today\u2019s SCOTUS decision on the Amendment, originalism is dead. Let us hear no more sophistry concerning original intent. If you\u2019re going to be phonies, at least be sincere about it. This is a momentous vote and a major milestone in the fight for reproductive freedom. We will continue this fight in the US, and I won't stop until every American once again enjoys the freedom and bodily autonomy they deserve. Israel is absolutely within its rights to go after Hamas terrorists after the atrocities of October But not this way. Not at the cost of civilian deaths. Not at the cost of humanitarian catastrophe. That is an unacceptable price to be paid. This I\u2019m reflecting on the long fights for abortion rights, child care, paid leave, equal pay, and so much more. These important fights are far from over, and I\u2019m not backing down. Republicans' sham impeachment inquiry is based on testimony from a potential Russian agent, an accused Chinese spy, and someone currently in prison for fraud.

I am honored to announce my guest for this year's State of the Union \u2013 Barb Collura, President & CEO of RESOLVE: the National Infertility Association. Barb is my constituent and an unyielding IVF advocate. Her presence will send a powerful message. This is horrifying. The IDF\u2019s use of live ammunition against hungry Palestinian civilians is repugnant. Half the population in Gaza is on the brink of famine. Aid must be surged immediately and at a much greater scale to end the unfolding humanitarian crisis. The United States must use every piece of leverage to put a stop to this unending cycle of carnage. Senate Republicans just blocked a bill to protect access to IVF for Americans across the country. In case there was still any confusion about where they actually stand on the issue. About to join live on . Tune in! With more journalists killed in months in Gaza than have ever been killed in one country over the course of a year, urgent action is needed to protect press freedom and the lives of journalists in this conflict. and I are pushing for it. Symbolic gestures are empty. This is simple \u2014 if you actually care about protecting IVF, join us on \u2019s critical legislation. This is why a fully funded IRS makes your life easier, not harder. After years of bad service thanks to GOP budget cuts, Dems took action. The IRS has now reached a level of service on their main phone line and has cut hold times to just mins. We're facing a partial shutdown in just a matter of days if Republicans don't act. Federal employees and contractors will be furloughed or work without pay, and Americans will lose access to vital government services.: choose the right thing, not the right wing. Proud to receive an A on this year's ' Congressional Scorecard! I will always stand up for our national parks and fight for conservation efforts in Virginia and across the country.

Thank you Steve for a wonderful discussion. Today I took a few minutes on the House Floor to celebrate my special family members who have been an inspiration and support system during my years in Congress. As we mourn the loss of a very special East Tennessean, Stan Brock, I wanted to share a story about his amazing life for those who never had the chance to get to know him.

It's so great to see your gift celebrated by Knoxville and the whole country! Interesting take on the national media by Suzanne Fields", "Mitt Romney captures my concern that the President's rhetoric does not attempt to unite the nation. The country would be better off if everyone -- Republican and Democrat -- toned down their rhetoric and focused on solving our biggest challenges. The First STEP Act is a historic bipartisan reform that will increase community safety, reduce recidivism, and make federal sentencing laws more fair. All of this will be accomplished while ensuring violent criminals and drug traffickers serve their time. The true state of our national debt and deficit is described here by a Manhattan Institute scholar. This is biggest issue we face as a nation which gets little coverage or attention. President Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the US troops from Syria is the wrong move, at the wrong time. US leadership is critical to thwarting Iranian and Russian ambitions in that region. US withdrawal risks the security of our allies Israel, Jordan, and the Kurds. It also threatens to worsen the humanitarian disaster among refugees in that region. We are kidding ourselves if we believe that ISIS and other aligned terrorists are defeated. Population loss figures don\u2019t lie. New Yorkers continue to vote with their feet. State \u201ceconomic development\u201d spending, like that announced yesterday, does little to fix this trend. I'm happy that a much-needed overhaul of the Congressional harassment and discrimination complaint and investigative processes passed the Senate. Harassment, abuse, and discrimination in the workplace are unacceptable, and Americans expect far better from those elected to serve.

We will never forget the men and women who were in Hawaii that day, and those who responded during the course of World War II.

It drives up the cost of construction for schools, roads, bridges, and affordable housing. How it drives up costs and why it needs to be reformed: My statement on the passing of President George H.W. Bush: Migrant melee is another example of why we need to enact stronger border security. The system of releasing asylum seekers into the nation results in more people claiming asylum. This is another reason why our legislation to fix the immigration system while resolving DACA and ending diversity lottery represents a realistic compromise on this issue. A new piece from EJ McMahon highlights the astronomical cost of bringing Amazon to NY. These costs will be paid by the taxpayers, including the brick and mortar businesses that Amazon is in most direct competition. Justice will be served for those responsible for the attempted attacks against Pres. Obama, Sec. Clinton and others. These actions run counter to our values and do nothing more than divide and terrorize our country. I am grateful for the Secret Service and local law enforcement. I am thankful for the service and sacrifice of the many police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel. I attended the First Responders Mass at St. Peter\u2019s Church alongside local law enforcement and firefighters to honor the many brave men and women who help keep us safe.

I had the opportunity to meet many local veterans before they embarked on a one-day, expense-paid honor flight to our nation\u2019s capital through Patriot Flight.

We discussed the Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act and the Palliative Care & Hospice Education & Training Act, legislation that I cosponsor. #CancerLobbyDay I joined my colleague Rep. Tenney in urging the President to issue a major disaster declaration and provide additional federal assistance to fourteen counties in Upstate New York that have been severely impacted by August\u2019s extreme weather. Great news as this project is going to invest millions into Ulster County, and create over new jobs. Tourism is vital to our local economies as visitors to Ulster Co spent million last year. Nearly one out of every three seniors on Medicare Part D were prescribed opioids in The Senate passed a opioids package earlier this week, which included my bill to update opioid-related education for seniors under Medicare Part D. Yesterday, the Senate passed the STOP Act as part of a comprehensive opioids package. I championed this legislation in the House that would give law enforcement the tools they need to identify and intercept illegal international drug shipments. This bipartisan compromise contains the highest dollar level ever for the Department of Veterans Affairs. We must always support our nation's vets and get them the benefits they have earned. A member of my staff will be hosting mobile office hours today in Liberty from AM to PM at the Town Hall, North Main St. We can assist if you are having difficulty with any federal agency.

Upstate New York is home to the hardest working farmers in America whose high-quality products feed the region and the rest of the country. The DOJ has intensified its fight against fentanyl from China by indicting two prolific producers of the deadly drug. By passing the STOP Act, we can add to this effort and stop these synthetic drugs from reaching our communities. Senator Schumer\u2019s position that the Senate shouldn\u2019t consider the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh because of Cohen and Manafort is absurd.

Celebrating all the hard fought achievements gained by our organized labor movement.", "I was proud to receive the \u2019s Lyme Champion Award for my work to help patients with Lyme and tick-borne diseases. Lyme disease affects NJ families more than most states. I\u2019m working in Congress to make sure those with Lyme Disease get the care they need. This is what happens when far-right extremists\u2019 wage their war on women\u2019s healthcare. For the rights of women in Jersey and across our nation, I won\u2019t stop fighting until we put an end to these awful attacks on IVF. It\u2019s infuriating to see so many universities receive failing grades on the \u2019s antisemitism report card. The rise in antisemitism isn\u2019t something we can ignore. We must tackle it head on. There\u2019s no place for any form of hate on college campuses. I\u2019m calling on with to investigate Commissioner Hayden\u2019s false claims of military service. Stolen valor is not just illegal, but also offensive to brave veterans who have actually served and sacrificed for our freedoms. Happy #NJLocalGovt Week! My door is always open to Jersey\u2019s local elected officials. It is critical that we work together to make life more affordable, keep our communities safe, and claw back federal investments for hardworking Jersey families. The , nurses, teachers, law enforcement, small businesses, and families from around the Tri-State area have spoken in unison: don\u2019t raise our taxes, don\u2019t pollute our children, & whack us with the outrageous Congestion Tax. The had one response: Go fly a kite. Happy #NationalPetDay from our family dog, Rosie! We must pass commonsense gun safety solutions to keep children & families safe across the country. Glad that a loophole has been closed that permitted the sale of a gun without background checks. I\u2019m heartbroken to hear about the passing of my friend and former Morristown Council President Sandi Mayer. She was a fierce and stalwart advocate for democracy, women\u2019s health, the US-Israel relationship, and the Jewish community in North Jersey. May her memory be a blessing. Great to see students at the steps of the Capitol! I\u2019m always excited for the opportunity to chat with the next generation, hear their ideas, and teach them about our nation\u2019s government. Allied Beverages is one of New Jersey\u2019s great local businesses that supports our economy! It was great to tour their facility, & see everything it takes to employ dozens of Jersey residents & be one of the largest wine & spirits distributors in the country. Local businesses are the backbone of Jersey\u2019s economy, and I\u2019m dedicated to working across the aisle to cut taxes and help them unleash more economic opportunity. Each year, high school student artists from across the Fifth District submit incredible pieces of artwork to the Congressional Art Competition.

Collaboration \u2014 across the aisle and across sectors \u2014 is key to making America the world\u2019s AI leader, building our AI workforce, and ensuring AI works for all. Months after Hamas brutally killed their admission that fewer than hostages may be alive for a deal is heartbreaking. Hamas has dragged out negotiations, knowing hostages were dead. Time is of the essence. Innocent lives are at stake. We must bring them home. I won't stop working to bring the remaining hostages, including Americans like Edan Alexander \u2014 my constituent from Tenafly, NJ \u2014 safely home. My heart goes out to the families of those lost. May their memories be a blessing. The is a bottomless black box with endless wasteful spending \u2014 it\u2019s no surprise that so many in NJ and NY are standing up against their proposed Congestion tax. Hardworking NJ families know the Congestion Tax is nothing but a cash grab. After years of being ignored by the , hardworking families who oppose the Congestion Tax are finally getting their day in court. I stand with the thousands of people fighting to stop this cancer-causing Congestion Tax. A critical part of North Jersey\u2019s strength is our proud AAPI community. Glad to meet with AAPI leaders from Fort Lee on policy issues directly affecting them, including making life more affordable, fighting the Congestion Tax, & getting health care for Korean-American veterans. It was exciting to celebrate the incredible impact has had over the past years, continue the fight to strengthen civil rights and reproductive freedom, and honor the King family and Debra Messing! Glad to meet in Washington to discuss bipartisan solutions to increase access to capital for businesses of all sizes. In New Jersey, banking is a key part of our economy, employing more than people. I\u2019m disgusted by the Islamophobic vandalism at \u2019s Center for Islamic Life during Eid. The rise in Islamophobia and hate is not some figment of our imagination \u2014 people in North Jersey & across the country are facing hate & violence. We must all stand against it. This act of hostility is why I just introduced a resolution to condemn the rise of hate crimes \u2014 including Islamophobia & antisemitism. No one, regardless of race, ethnicity, or religion, should live in fear. There is no place for this hate in our state, communities, or nation. Far-right extremists in Arizona have resurrected another \u201czombie law\u201d to ban abortion. Bans like this will keep happening if we listen to Trump & leave abortion to the states. We need to send these anti-choice \u201czombie laws\u201d back to the dustbin of history. It was great to meet with to discuss how we can empower individuals with Down syndrome and their families. I want to make sure that our Down syndrome community gets the research funding and support they deserve. Watch I joined to talk about my trip to Qatar & Egypt.

It is unacceptable that ultra-right extremists are using this Civil War era law to ban women\u2019s access to medical care. Here in NJ, we protect \u2014 & will continue to protect \u2014 a woman\u2019s right to choose. I\u2019m doing all I can to guarantee the same protections for women across America. First, my bill affirms the \u2019s memo explaining that the Comstock Act does not prohibit the lawful mailing of abortion drugs. Second, it strongly condemns restrictions on reproductive healthcare like abortion bans and bans on the shipment of abortion medication. Far-right extremists have made it clear that they won\u2019t stop until women lose their fundamental right to choose. Today, I announced new legislation \u2014 the Protecting Personal, Private Medical Decisions Act \u2014 to combat those who have declared a war on choice & healthcare. At the Supreme Court, extremists want to resurrect a \u201czombie law,\u201d known as the Comstock Act, to ban the abortion pill Mifepristone. That\u2019s why I announced a new bill to make it clear that the Comstock Act must not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 be used to restrict a woman\u2019s right to choose. Great to meet to discuss my bipartisan Invest to Protect Act to give officers the resources they need to keep us safe. You can\u2019t cut your way to safer communities & better police departments \u2014 we must invest to protect & always get the backs of those who have ours. I won't stand idly by as far-right extremists wage a war on choice, a war on women\u2019s healthcare, and a war on personal privacy Tune in live as I announce new legislative action to safeguard access to Mifepristone, also known as the abortion pill The \u2019s continued silence in the face of the Houthi\u2019s gruesome crucifixion, stoning, & flogging sends a disturbing signal that LGBTQ+ individuals can be persecuted without consequence. It is past time for the UN to condemn these acts of hatred & terror. I joined this morning to discuss my recent trip to Qatar and Egypt. My message: We must bring the hostages home, get humanitarian aid to civilians, and crush Hamas. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, this trip was key to understanding the situation on the ground. As a proud member of the bipartisan , it\u2019s always good to sit down with . As ever, I will stand with and fight for NJ\u2019s Armenian American community \u2014 especially as the humanitarian crisis continues in Glad to have held a community discussion with NJ residents to discuss the rise in antisemitism & hate & how the events across the Middle East are affecting us all. Together, we encouraged dialogue & discussed new ways to make NJ a better place to live, work, & raise a family. Thank you, Rabbi Marc Katz, for opening Temple Ner Tamid\u2019s doors to us. These conversations are critically important. Using TikTok, China\u2019s government has the ability to control what an entire generation of Americans see and consume every single day The Senate needs to bring my bipartisan Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act to a vote. The Chinese Communist Party has made clear that it will leverage technology to spew disinformation, undermine democracy, & promote antisemitism.

Thank you for stopping by. I will always support their work to improve civic engagement, reproductive freedom, and all they do for Jersey. On average, cars a day \u2013 one every minutes \u2013 are stolen in Jersey. Our state\u2019s auto theft epidemic is unacceptable. That\u2019s why I\u2019m announcing new bipartisan legislation to help put a stop to organized auto theft. The CARS Act builds on my other work to prevent auto theft, carjacking, and related crimes. I\u2019m also encouraging DHS to step up its policing of auto theft and coordinate with our local law enforcement to recover stolen vehicles. We must ensure law enforcement has the resources they need to stop auto theft, protect our families and communities. Grateful for stopping by to meet with me and talk about the critical importance of investing in kidney cancer research and access to telehealth.

Wishing everyone peace, longevity, and prosperity in the Year of the Dragon! Instead of whacking commuters with a Congestion Tax, the should clean up their black box of endless spending & mismanagement first. That starts with the million lost each year in fare evasion. Absurd! Read more from : Stolen valor is not just illegal, but also offensive to NJ\u2019s veterans who have actually served and sacrificed. That\u2019s why and I sent a letter urging to investigate Sussex County Commissioner Bill Hayden for his repeated lies about military service. I refuse to silently stand by while our veterans and active duty service men and women are disrespected. Greg Lalevee, the business manager of , is right: the \u2019s Congestion Tax math doesn\u2019t add up. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve submitted a legal request to the requiring them to show how they calculated their Congestion Tax.

When a judge called the an \u201corgy of overtime fraud,\u201d they weren\u2019t kidding. In they spent a record-breaking billion on OT pay, proving that they\u2019re a black box where taxpayer dollars go to disappear. After blowing billions, they owe it to the public to explain. My office submitted a legal request to the mismanaged requiring them to open up their bottomless black box and provide documents showing how they calculated their Congestion Tax projections.

This investment will help build safe paths to schools by adding new sidewalk sections, reducing roadway widths, and installing driver feedback signs.", "And there's our answer: Senate Republicans just BLOCKED my bill to expand access to IVF and family-building services for veterans and servicemembers. Actions speak louder than words\u2014and their actions made clear yet again that the GOP does not support IVF. The number of murdered and missing indigenous women in Washington state and across the nation is terrifying and #SavannasAct would address this crisis with the urgency that it deserves. #MMIWG No kidding. This guy will ban abortion nationwide the first chance he gets. Mike Johnson is meeting with Donald Trump today. Reminder: Speaker Johnson's record on abortion and reproductive rights is as radical as it gets. These two will work hand-in-hand to ban abortion nationwide. . has taken historic action to relieve student loan debt & just announced more: an additional borrowers are now getting in thousands more in WA state. Learn more about getting student loan relief We will not be fooled by Donald Trump. Trump is responsible for overturning Roe\u2014and he owns every extreme abortion ban that has been enacted since. He created this health care crisis and we know he would absolutely sign a national abortion ban if given the chance. I\u2019ve tried to pass my bill to expand access to IVF for servicemembers and veterans\u2014and Republicans blocked it. I will not give up this fight, and this week at , I discussed how important access to IVF is for those who serve our country. Watch below Glad to see the background check expansion we passed in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act being put into action. This rule closes a dangerous loophole and will help keep guns out of the hands of abusers & violent criminals\u2014which will save lives. Child care is an issue that affects absolutely businesses, & our entire economy. It's a top economic challenge & has to be a top priority for Congress. That's why I made sure we did more in our funding bills to address this crisis. Democrats have been focused on addressing the challenges at our border & ensuring has the resources it needs\u2014but, at Trump's command, Republicans walked away from a bipartisan deal to do that. We need reasonable, bipartisan solutions, not more political games. Access to affordable child care. Paid leave. Investments in home care. These are the steps I'm fighting for to make sure we support working families in WA state and across the country. #CareCantWait Washington state is the most beautiful state in the country\u2014and it\u2019s so critical that has adequate funding to make sure future generations will be able to marvel at our national forests and public lands. Congress won't be done with until we pass the national security supplemental and provide desperately needed aid for Ukraine. The Senate did its job\u2014now, the Speaker needs to bring the bill up for a vote. No one should ever be stuck paying more on accrued interest than they borrowed in the first place, and this transformative plan by would wipe out unpaid interest for tens of millions of borrowers and do so much more to deliver much-needed relief. The AZ Supreme Court just upheld an extreme abortion ban that dates back to the Civil War & before women had the right to vote. This will have devastating consequences for women in Arizona\u2014and it's a direct result of Trump & the GOP overturning Roe and the freedom to choose. I fought hard to get more federal dollars to Washington state to help address the child care crisis\u2014but that's far from the end of this fight. I will keep pushing for progress every way I can, including passing my Child Care for Working Families Act. Access to the internet is downright essential in the century\u2014and funding made available through my Digital Equity Act will be a gamechanger in getting more people connected and online, and closing the digital divide. Future generations are counting on us to take action to address the climate crisis. That means building a clean energy economy, investing in climate resiliency, and protecting our natural resources and habitats. RT if you're with me. Trump\u2019s \u201cannouncement\u201d changes nothing. This is a man who bragged about overturning Roe, supports draconian abortion bans & said women should be punished for seeking care. Don't be fooled: we know a second Trump admin would do everything they could to ban abortion nationwide. Congress is back in session this week & at the top of 's list must be passing the Senate's bipartisan national security package to support allies like Ukraine & provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to civilians caught in conflict. There is no time to waste. RT if you agree we need commonsense gun safety legislation that we know saves lives\u2014like an assault weapons ban and universal background checks. Thanks to the doctors and leaders at the Bwaila Hospital who welcomed us to their facility and showed us how U.S. investments support their maternity ward\u2014the busiest in the region\u2014and their tuberculosis and HIV clinics. I appreciated the hospitality from , , & while traveling in Africa. It was good to learn more about our shared priorities and how we can keep working together. Two years after being confirmed to SCOTUS, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson continues to inspire women & girls everywhere\u2014not only as the first Black woman to serve on the highest court, but also the first public defender in this position, bringing with her an important perspective. Whether or not a woman can make her own health care decisions should not depend on where she lives or how much money she has. Abortion is essential health care\u2014and I'll keep fighting to protect the right for every woman to get the health care she needs. I had the opportunity to meet and thank the in Malawi who are bravely serving our country. I am so grateful for their hard work and the sacrifices they and their families make. I enjoyed spending time in Zambia meeting with local leaders and constituents from WA state to hear about how our investments in the region are helping support these communities and economies\u2014and why they make such an important difference.

People that should have a say in women's health care People that RT if you agree. The Gray and Oregon Road Fires were devastating\u2014and I've been working to make sure the federal government steps up to help. The deadline to apply for relief through and is April Learn more and get started: Far too many Americans struggle with student debt, and knows it. The SAVE plan: stops interest from piling on provides forgiveness faster cuts monthly payments in half Visit to see how you can SAVE. The severe winter storms across WA state this January were extensive and damage to power lines, schools, & more. Our entire delegation is urging to approve 's Major Disaster Declaration so impacted communities can get resources to recover. The Florida Supreme Court's decision will allow Republicans' devastating abortion ban to go into effect\u2014before most women even know they are pregnant. Floridians who don't want the gov't interfering with their health care will decide in November whether this ban stays. Great news: \u2019 Swift Orange Line is open and ready to ride! Public transit connects communities, cuts down traffic, and reduces why I made certain the federal government made the Swift Orange Line a priority. The opioid epidemic has been devastating in WA state. So I made it a priority in our government funding bills to protect critical dollars that help communities tackle this crisis and provide substance use disorder prevention and treatment nationwide. Right-wing attacks on medication abortion, birth control, & so much more are part of a coordinated, planned effort\u2014decades in the making\u2014to rip away a woman's ability to make her own health care decisions. We've got to stand together & keep fighting back. Addressing our child care crisis is a top priority for families\u2014and in my view, if something\u2019s a top priority for families nationwide, it sure better be a top priority for Congress, too. As we work to pass laws that ensure equal rights & protections for trans Americans, speaking out publicly to voice our support for the trans community does indeed matter. My message to trans people, and especially trans kids is: you belong. #TDOV Every time the right to abortion is on the ballot, it wins. Republicans need to stop trying to rip away women's ability to make their own health care decisions and listen to their constituents. Spread the word: Survivors of the Grey and Oregon wildfires have until **April to submit paperwork and qualify for assistance. I've long heard from military families about their struggles to find child care\u2014that's why I fought to secure millions more in the gov't funding bills to support 's child care initiatives, help families get child care, & DOUBLE pre-K enrollment at our installations. Sea levels are rising, our winters are shorter, and natural disasters are becoming more common. Climate change isn't a worry for the future\u2014it's happening now. I am doing everything I can to make sure we reduce emissions, improve sustainability, and build a clean energy economy. Joe Lieberman dedicated his life to the people of Connecticut and he was similarly dedicated to his faith and family. We didn't always agree but he led a tremendous career in public service. My thoughts are with Joe's many loved ones as they celebrate and remember his life. We've got to do more to address youth homelessness, and new support I secured in the gov't funding bill\u2014based on my provide grants to state, local, and Tribal governments and local organizations to help prevent youth homelessness. I'll keep fighting to do more. The number of women veterans who have experienced military sexual assault is appalling. I'm calling on the VA to do better, and make sure these survivors have the support they need. Washington state is already a leader in clean energy and renewable resources. New funding from will continue investing in our electric grid & cutting-edge research on keep everyone\u2019s lights on while lowering costs and emissions. Today I led members of Congress in an amicus brief urging SCOTUS to find the federal law EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency stabilizing care\u2014including emergency abortion care\u2014regardless of Idaho\u2019s draconian abortion restrictions. With tax day coming up soon, filing can be confusing and costly\u2014and it shouldn't be. WA state residents can now file federal taxes directly with the IRS for FREE with their new Direct File program. Click the link to see if you qualify! We need to restore the right to abortion nationwide. RT if you're with me. I'm thinking of the victims and Maryland families affected by the devastating collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. My heart goes out to them\u2014and we'll be ready to help rebuild however possible in the Senate. WA state is a leader in electric vehicle technology. New funding from will help keep that up by supporting 's EV repair training program to help create good paying jobs, cut carbon emissions, and move us toward a clean energy economy. Weeks ago, the Senate passed a strong, bipartisan package to support allies like Ukraine and provide more desperately needed humanitarian aid to civilians caught in conflict. Time is running out & Ukraine needs our support. \u2014bring this bill up for a vote. The SCOTUS case about access to mifepristone threatens to upend the science-based and expert-driven FDA approval process that Americans rely on for all manner of lifesaving drugs, everything from cancer treatments and diabetes medication to birth control. The Supreme Court case about access to mifepristone has nothing to do with science. It\u2019s a blatant attack, meticulously planned, by anti-choice extremists and Republicans who are doing everything they can to ban abortion nationwide. Washington state's ports are a gateway to the rest of the world. It was great to meet with to discuss how I'm fighting to support and upgrade ports in my home state and across the country. Women should be making their own decisions about their pregnancies and when to start a family\u2014not politicians or judges. RT if you agree. Had a great discussion with on their work providing housing services for families & individuals in the region. Addressing the housing crisis in WA state is one of my top priorities\u2014& I made sure our government funding bills protected essential housing programs. We can\u2014and must\u2014reduce gun violence in America. We have solutions we know can save lives, and the only thing standing in our way is Republicans\u2019 refusal to stand up to the gun lobby. I won't let that deter me and will keep pushing for common sense gun safety legislation. Salmon are essential for Washington state's environment, economy, and Pacific Northwest Tribes\u2014and I'm grateful to see new federal funding support the Lummi Nation's salmon recovery efforts. I fought hard to make sure our government funding bills address the child care crisis\u2014and I'm proud that work included securing federal support for United Learning Center of Lewis County's brand-new early learning center. I met with WA Rep. Kevin Waters from the Skamania County Economic Development Council to discuss how to better support rural schools and create opportunities for economic growth\u2014kids in Skamania deserve the same opportunities as kids in Seattle. The climate crisis is a threat to our communities, infrastructure, environment, and future generations. I'm doing everything I can in the Senate to make sure we take action on climate and invest in a clean energy economy. It's the only way we can move forward. The Affordable Care Act has helped millions get health care coverage, protected people with pre-existing conditions, & much more. Democrats have built on the ACA, lowering premiums & allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices\u2014& we\u2019ll keep pushing for more progress. Republicans have tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than times*\u2014and now they\u2019re gearing up to do it again. ACA repeal would rip health care coverage away from millions of people, send costs soaring, end protections for pre-existing conditions\u2014& more. As Chair of , my responsibility is to help decide how to set the nation\u2019s spending priorities. I wanted to write our bills to put working people\u2014the parents I talk to all around my state who can\u2019t find or afford child care\u2014first. Strong investments in American families and billion more for child care and pre-k is headed your way, ! The Senate just passed the last bicameral, bipartisan government funding bills\u2014critical resources for everything from education to health care. These bills protect & strengthen federal investments that really matter to WA state & I'm glad we got them across the finish line. Child care was top of mind for me as we negotiated the government funding bills\u2014and I'm proud to have secured more for affordable child care and pre-k! There's still more to do to tackle the child care crisis, but this is a HUGE win for families. As SCOTUS considers FDA's expanded approval of mifepristone, sent a brief to make clear we stand with science & with women. Upending FDA's approval process in any way would not only restrict access to abortion care in EVERY STATE, but would create health care chaos. This bipartisan government funding package invests in our families, economy, & national security. Now, let's get this across the finish line and avoid an unnecessary shutdown. years after the Oso mudslide took lives and devastated nearby communities, my thoughts are with the families whose lives were forever changed. Appreciate 's work to shine a light on this tragic day and how the community came together to recover & rebuild. It was great to see friendly faces from and hear updates on the exciting infrastructure and transportation projects they have in the works and coming up in the future. Always great to get updates from on how they're expanding the city's infrastructure and how I can continue to be their partner in the Other Washington. Had a great discussion with commissioner, Jerome Delvin, about the pressing challenges in his as wildfire and flooding preparedness and responding and expanding access to mental and behavioral health care and resources. Republicans are gearing up to\u2014once again\u2014repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw people's lives into chaos. Democrats' message to them ahead of the ACA anniversary is simple: do not test us. It's been a long road to get here but we now have the second bipartisan government funding package. We had to work with tough constraints but this bill invests in families & will keep our country moving forward. Let's finish the job & get it signed into law ASAP. I\u2019ve made clear child care is a top priority for just about every family and must also be a top priority for Congress\u2014and I fought hard to get billion more in the government funding bills to lower families\u2019 child care costs and support Head Start. The Port of Grays Harbor has grown immensely in recent years. It was great to get an update from local leaders on their efforts to expand the Port's infrastructure and capacity through the Terminal project and modernize the marina. Judge Rebecca Pennell has spent her career working to ensure vulnerable people in Washington state can access a justice system that treats people fairly and works for everyone. I'll be working hard to advance her nomination to the federal bench. Had a great conversation with folks from Yakima County about their work making it easier for people and goods to get where they need to go with new urban & rural transportation projects\u2014and how federal support will be critical to making this happen. It\u2019s been a long road, but we have a bipartisan, bicameral funding agreement on the rest of the bills. We have been working overtime to finalize that package and release text\u2014and when we do, we all need to work together to get these passed ASAP & avoid a needless shutdown. The leader of the Republican party is openly saying he wants to ban abortion nationwide\u2014even in pro-choice states like Washington. Republicans' goal has ALWAYS been to take away the right to choose everywhere & give politicians the power to make women's health care decisions. Republicans do not support IVF. If they did, they wouldn't support fetal personhood & they wouldn't have blocked bills that would have protected access to IVF\u2014twice! No matter what I will keep fighting to protect women's access to IVF every chance I get. It was great to see Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians Chairman Eric White and other council members today. I appreciate them sharing the Tribe's priorities and challenges\u2014and how I can continue to be their partner at the federal level. As a fellow ferry commuter, I know how critical our ferries are to getting people where they're going\u2014and how important they are to WA state's economy. That's why I fought hard to secure millions of additional dollars in the government funding bills to support our ferry systems. WA state is famous for our sweet cherries\u2014but the weather-driven losses put growers in a tough spot. I'm so glad to see grant the disaster declaration I pushed for to get cherry growers the federal assistance they need to start the new growing season strong. Good to speak with Latvia's Prime Minister about our continued partnership in NATO and our shared efforts to support Ukraine against Putin's bloody invasion. It\u2019s time to allow a vote on our bipartisan national security bill, . Great news! Opill, the first-ever birth control is now available *in stores* in Washington state and across the country\u2014no prescription needed! Click the link to find where you can get it near you. Women are half the population & yet we are nowhere near where we need to be when it comes to federal investments in women's health research. This is a needed step by to ensure women\u2019s health is better understood so women can get quality health care at every stage. Great to meet with the folks from the Pacific Seafood Processors Association and discuss how I can help continue the push to include support for seafood producers in the upcoming Farm Bill. Not once\u2014but twice, Senate Republicans blocked Democrats' attempts to protect and expand access to IVF. TWICE. No matter what they say, their actions have proved again and again that they do not support IVF & do not want women being able to make their own health care decisions. The program is an incredible organization that empowers bright young minds to learn through working in their community. I had a great time speaking with teen leaders from Washington state who are building skills in health, science, agriculture, and civic engagement. As a former schoolboard member, I know our school principals do important work. It's always great to see the friendly faces from and discuss how we can work together to support principals, teachers, and students in Washington state. It was an absolute pleasure to meet Saraswathy, one of the #RegeneronSTS finalists from Redmond! Her work increasing access to STEM programs for underserved students and communities is an inspiring example of what the next generation can achieve. We can\u2019t address the full scope of the gun violence epidemic in this country without taking major federal action on universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, & more. A patchwork of gun safety laws is not adequate\u2014we need federal laws in place to protect our families. I worked hard to secure historic funding for the Hanford site. As long as I Chair , we are going to do right by the workers at Hanford and make sure we protect the environment and nearby communities like the Tri-Cities. Had the wonderful opportunity to meet with Vietnam Vice President Vo Thi Anh Xuan. It's incredibly important to me to meet with leaders from other countries, share ideas, and discuss how we can work together to promote our shared interests.", "\u201cLocal workers can be the first in line for these jobs, thanks to Karen.\u201d - Thank you President Biden for working with me to bring JOBS to Los Angeles. All too often, folks who have served their time are released from jail with no where to go and no resources to access. That often leads to homelessness \u2014 not just in L.A. but nationwide. It\u2019s a cycle we must work to break and today, Congress took a big step in that direction. The One Stop Shop Community Reentry Program Act that I introduced last year will help create resource centers supporting people transitioning out of incarceration by providing access to employment and housing services. Thank you to my colleagues for your support. Today, we celebrate together with gratitude and high hopes for what is to come. Wishing everyone a happy and safe Thanksgiving!

I look forward to seeing all she does for the good people of California's District. Our district is in good hands. One year ago today, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill into law, which included my provision to bring jobs straight to Los Angeles.

We discussed the importance of supporting institutions and how Congress can continue to support our Latino and undocumented students. Republicans and their leader President Trump cheered when they overturned Roe v. Wade, stripping away abortion rights for millions of women. Don\u2019t let them fool you. They are to blame for the extreme abortion bans across the country today. Great news! Today announced another round of student loan cancellation, bringing a total of million Americans approved for debt relief! Today Republicans in the held a hearing to discuss the Trump tax cuts supposed benefits for working & low-income families. Yet none of their witnesses were low-income Americans. Why don't they want us to hear from those who actually deserve tax relief? Happy National Pet Day from Scully! The GOP Tax Scam is a masterclass in failed promises to working families: it didn\u2019t raise wages, increase revenue, or kickstart investment. It\u2019s time we use the tax code to invest in those who need it most. Since took office, he\u2019s been breaking record after record, showing that when you invest in workers and their families, our economy grows, and we all win. Contrast that with Republican Tax Cuts that enrich shareholders and high-paid execs. . reversed decades of Republican underfunding the IRS & now the agency is delivering historic levels of customer service: more live assistance, shorter wait times, no returns backlog, & new digital tools.

Today, & I led colleagues in urging the Admin remove ISDS from our trade deal w/Central America & the Dominican Republic. ISDS allows foreign firms to sue democracies over polices that improve labor rights & protect the environment. It is unfair & must end. By removing ISDS we can focus on fair trade that will build a more stable future for these governments & address the root causes of migration. More here: SB should never go into effect. It will only weaponize law enforcement against immigrant communities & further encourage racial profiling of our communities. We need real, legal pathways to immigration, not further chaos at our borders. While Republicans turn a blind eye to climate change, I will always fight to ensure our nation\u2019s children inherit a greener, healthier world. House Republicans just released an extreme new budget that will end Medicare & Social Security as we know it, endanger the health of working families, and rig the system to benefit the rich & powerful. It\u2019s clear who House Republicans value \u2013 and it\u2019s not hard-working Americans. Last Congress, Democrats delivered the largest climate investment in history with the Inflation Reduction Act. This Congress, House Republicans are wasting time with their \u201cEnergy Week\u201d to offer nothing to combat climate change & boost Big Oil profits. Este a\u00f1o, un n\u00famero r\u00e9cord de m\u00e1s de millones de estadounidenses se han inscrito en planes de salud y a precios razonables a trav\u00e9s del Mercado de Seguros M\u00e9dicos. \u00a1Bajo el presidente Biden, m\u00e1s estadounidenses tienen cuidado de salud que durante ninguna otra presidencia!

This Year of the Dragon, I wish all those celebrating happiness, success, and blessings to you and your loved ones! The expanded monthly Child Tax Credit was the most successful tool EVER to lift American children out of poverty. As a mother & legislator, I won\u2019t stop fighting for our nation's most vulnerable working families who deserve tax relief just as much as big businesses.

On the anniversary of the Parkland shooting, I urge the GOP to work with us in doing more to protect our community and put an end to this epidemic. Happy Valentine's Day! I wish all those in a day filled with love & cheer. Instead of working on real policy solutions for our border & immigration system, MAGA Republicans are taking orders from their leader Trump & wasting time on a baseless impeachment stunt. The American people are tired of their political chaos & deserve better. Thanks to Investing in America Agenda & , airports serving families in are receiving million in federal funding! I'm proud to help deliver these investments for airport workers & the Californian families they serve. I am very saddened to see the layoffs that will greatly affect our Southern California community, workers, & families all while resulting in a decade of lost science.

In the meantime, I urge my GOP colleagues to work with us quickly so that we can complete appropriations bills & fully fund NASA & NASA sciences that will keep our country at the forefront of innovation & support our STEM community. Republicans are obsessed with attacking the LGBTQI+ community \u2013 and being on the wrong side of history. As a vice chair of the , I\u2019m proud to stand on the side of love and push back against far-right extremists\u2019 hatred. Happy Lunar New Year!

Today, I voted against the CASH Act because we cannot continue to endlessly dig our national debt hole deeper. I was proud to support the COVID relief bill last week, which President Trump thankfully decided to sign yesterday. Deficit spending during this pandemic is absolutely necessary. If more aid is needed next year, Congress can work on providing that. But fiscal year (which ended September recorded a trillion deficit which was more than double the previous record. Federal debt is now larger than the US economy. Austerity should not be instituted now; stimulus is needed. But this does not mean we do not have to consider what we are spending and what debt we are passing onto future generations. Merry Christmas to all!! Just received my vaccine dose. I\u2019ve been careful the past months since as a diabetic I\u2019m at high risk. There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we all need to do our part to avoid COVID.

New CDC estimates suggest schools may see an additional cost per student to adopt mitigation strategies to stop the spread of As we work on a relief package, we need bipartisan solutions to support our schools, families & communities In my farewell speech on the House floor I said that House rules must change to facilitate bipartisan compromise so that Congress can start solving problems facing our nation and stop yielding power to the president. I also thanked my wonderful staff and talked about all that we accomplished for the people of the Third District and our country. I am honored to be called a maverick and included in such an august group of public officials. In an era of unthinking tribalism, being engaged, informed, and educated is more difficult and more important than ever.

Wishing a warm and happy Hanukkah to all those who will begin observing the Festival of Lights this evening With Trump back on Twitter, it\u2019s a good time to watch this Jan hearing. It covers each of Trump\u2019s tweets that day, including those that have been deleted, and features multiple Trump WH staff describing his inexcusable conduct during the violence. Wishing everyone a blessed and meaningful Yom Kippur to those at home and around the world. G'mar Chatima Tovah! Shanah Tovah! Wishing everyone a happy and peaceful new year as Rosh Hashanah begins this evening. The hearings have shown that Trump knew his effort to overturn the election was illegal & He did it anyway. Trump\u2019s conduct was illegal under existing law and would be under our new bill, too. Our bill also prevents other future efforts to steal elections. Are you interested in attending , , , or the Merchant Marine Academy? Attend our informational event this Saturday in Cheyenne and meet with representatives from our office, ROTC programs, & our prestigious U.S. Service Academies. Today, the House took an important bipartisan step to protect all future presidential elections. It will ensure that self-interested politicians cannot steal from the people the guarantee that our government derives its power from the consent of the governed. My full statement: We owe a debt of gratitude to men and women of the Greatest Generation who laid down their lives for our freedom \u2013 like Wyoming's own Major Virgil Olds. I was deeply honored to help with this long overdue tribute to this fallen American hero. Bit by bit, excuse by excuse we're putting Donald Trump above the law. We are rendering indefensible conduct normal, legal and appropriate \u2013 as though he were a King. Thank you . We are grateful to you and all the experts who contributed to this crucial effort. We look forward to continuing to work with our colleagues in the House and Senate to preserve the rule of law for all future presidential elections. Thank you to the airmen and women \u2013 at F.E. Warren AFB and stationed across the world \u2013 who work tirelessly to protect our nation and defend our freedom. Happy Birthday to the ! We must never forget those killed in the terrorist attacks of and we must continue to honor our American heroes who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe and free. On September Louisa Swain made history in Laramie and became the first woman to cast a ballot in a general election in the United States. Her legacy serves as an important reminder as we honor all of the trailblazing women who have come before us. Happy Birthday to the ! Celebrate years of NPS by exploring these American treasurers without an entrance fee today. Today marks Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day and months since Putin launched his unprovoked, brutal invasion. America must stand proudly with Ukraine in their fight for freedom. What I'm fighting for is the Constitution. What I'm fighting for is the perpetuation of the Republic. What I'm fighting for is the fact that elections have to matter. I have been ashamed to hear members of my party attacking the integrity of the FBI agents involved with the recent Mar-a-Lago search. These are sickening comments that put the lives of patriotic public servants at risk. It was wonderful to meet with local AIPAC members at the Jackson Hole Jewish Community Center. I will never waver in my support for a strong US- Israel relationship and Israel\u2019s right to defend herself. Great to be part of the annual golf invitational to support the Wyoming Congressional Award program. Wyoming leads the nation as our students take part in congressional awards to serve their communities and further their leadership development. Continued reduction in the timber sale program based on a significantly flawed report will unjustly impact communities in the Black Hills. I sent a letter urging Sec. Vilsack to redo the report collaboratively with input from local stakeholders. We can combat the skyrocketing gas prices we've seen in Wyoming and across the country by unleashing our domestic energy resources. American energy producers can meet America\u2019s energy needs \u2013 if we let them. The addition of Finland and Sweden will strengthen the capabilities and deterrence posture of NATO, while sending a clear message to Putin. I hope our allies will move swiftly in support of these new European partners. Heartbroken to hear the terrible news about Jackie Walorski, Zachary Potts and Emma Thompson. There was no more dedicated or effective member of Congress than Jackie. I was proud to be her friend. Phil and I are keeping Jackie, Zachary and Emma\u2019s families in our prayers. .: The Eastman memos & fake elector scheme are indefensible. On the memos: Eastman took the opposite legal position a month before the election; he knew all Justices would rule against him; & he admitted it was illegal in an Oval Office meeting & afterwards. White House lawyers said it was illegal too. The fake electoral slates were obviously false, and were transmitted to multiple federal officials for purposes of obstructing the electoral count. None of this is ambiguous. Watch the hearings, and read the opinion of the federal judge who concluded that Eastman and Trump likely violated two criminal statutes. Ayman Al-Zawahiri\u2019s bloodshed has come to an end because of the dogged efforts of our professionals. I commend the Biden Admin for taking this decisive action & proactively using America's strength to defend our interests. My full stmt: It was my honor to be part of the Pilgrimage, and to celebrate Norm Mineta & Al Simpson, who met at the camp as young boys when Norm and his family were incarcerated there during WWII.

Congratulations to Harlan Kredit for years of dedication and service at ! With soaring inflation and prices at the pump, it\u2019s long past time to set aside the political rhetoric against the federal oil & gas leasing program and simply follow the law. I joined my Wyoming colleagues in urging Sec. Haaland to defend these permits: I\u2019m proud the House passed my bipartisan Advancing Telehealth Beyond Act & I look forward to it becoming law. This legislation will make an important difference in Wyoming & across the country by making it easier for patients to take advantage of telehealth services. In Wyoming, we have increased Sage Grouse habitat while maintaining multiple use that are so important to our state, our citizens, our way of life and our economy. My op-ed with Bob Budd on the importance of local stakeholders in species management: I\u2019m pleased to have worked w/ on legislation to expand telehealth services. After our bill's passage in the House tonight, I look forward to it becoming law & giving folks in Wyoming & across the country more access to quality health care. I'm honored to help lead the Advancing Telehealth Beyond Act \u2013 an important piece of bipartisan legislation that will expand flexibility for patients and allow more Americans to use telehealth services for high-quality care. The Committee is investigating the clear security and intelligence failures of the day, but we aren't going to blame the Capitol Police and those in law enforcement for Donald Trump's armed mob that he sent to the Capitol. The facts are indisputable. While the Capitol was being attacked by an armed mob sent by Donald Trump, he would not tell them to go home for over minutes. That is a dereliction of duty like we have never seen before. Hey - heard you on criticizing the Jan hearings. Then you said the strangest thing; you admitted you hadn\u2019t watched any of them. Here\u2019s a tip: actually watching them before rendering judgment is more consistent with \u201cAnglo-American jurisprudence.\u201d We have to elect serious candidates who will take their obligations and their oaths seriously. We have to be able to come together and stop the dangerous kind of toxic politics that we have seen. January was a fundamental assault on our democracy. Investigating that attack and what led to it and looking at what we need to do legislatively to make sure it never happens again is our fundamental responsibility. It is tremendously moving and inspirational to see the honor, courage, and patriotism of the women who have come before the Committee like Cassidy Hutchinson, Sarah Matthews, Shaye Moss, Ruby Freeman and Caroline Edwards. This week I sat down w/ President Sarah Turner & Vice President Bree Coxbill. It was great to talk with these young leaders about the future of ag in our state & about the importance of pushing back on harmful regulations that hurt ranchers & farmers in Wyoming. With scenic views and vast landscapes that are second to none, it\u2019s no wonder that & top the list of best national parks. #ThatsWY We can\u2019t continue down this path. We need to reign in reckless spending and help to ease the burden on American families. In Congress, our most important duty is to provide for the security of our nation & our freedom. The NDAA passed by the House today ensures our men & women in uniform have the resources and the capabilities to defend against our adversaries. My full stmt: This is devastating news for the affected employees, their families, & the Rawlins & Sinclair communities. My office will work w/ the Governor\u2019s office as well as these communities & individuals to ensure we do everything possible to assist those affected. Strengthening & expanding Wyoming\u2019s suicide lifeline services to include state-based coverage is important and will save lives.

Happy Birthday to the Cowboy State! #ThatsWY Senator Al Simpson is a principled leader and his service to Wyoming and our nation is unmatched. He is most deserving of this honor and I am honored to call him friend. Uranium is critical to our nation\u2019s energy and national security \u2014 and it should be included on the critical minerals list. I\u2019m proud to co-sponsor this commonsense legislation to ensure that restoring our nation's energy leadership begins with Last week's decision reins in the EPA\u2019s federal overreach and over regulation on our power plants in Wyoming and across the country, while rightly returning the authority back to Congress where it belongs. \u201cAnd for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\u201d Closely monitoring the very concerning situation in Lingle as a result of the interstate Canal breach. My office will work w/ the Governor\u2019s office & the Bureau of Reclamation to provide assistance to those that need it. Please stay safe & seek shelter. As we heard yesterday, WH counsel Pat Cippollone had significant concerns re. Trump\u2019s Jan activities. It\u2019s time for Mr. Cippollone to testify on the record. Any concerns he has about the institutional interests of his prior office are outweighed by the need for his testimony. empowers students with the skills, values, & experience to be leaders \u2013 and I'm proud to be a member of the Caucus in Congress. It was wonderful to meet w/ members from across the state who are partaking in the Citizenship Washington Focus program last week. I have always been strongly pro-life. Today\u2019s ruling by the Supreme Court returns power to the states and the people of the states to address the issue of abortion under state law. During these hearings, I urge all Americans not to be distracted by politics. This is serious. We cannot let America become a nation of conspiracy theories and thug violence. Happy Father\u2019s Day to my incredible dad This was a moving moment at the January hearing yesterday from Vice President Pence\u2019s counsel, Greg Jacob. Mr. Jacob stood with Vice President Pence during the violent attack on our Capitol and served our nation with honor. An honorable man receiving the information and advice that Mr. Trump received from his campaign experts and his staff \u2013 a man who loved his country more than himself \u2013 would have conceded this election. We know that a number of his closest aides urged him to do so. Just spoke w/ about the historic flooding and severe damage to and the surrounding communities. Our office will continue to work with federal, state, and local officials to support relief efforts. The misguided policies from Washington and lost revenue from the lack of lease sales will negatively impact our children\u2019s futures. Damage to Yellowstone is severe. Park entrances remain closed. My office and I will continue to work closely with the Natl Park Service & Dept of Interior to ensure we provide maximum resources and support to repair damaged roads, bridges and infrastructure throughout the park. Happy Birthday to the ! Thanks to the generations of soldiers who have bravely answered our nation\u2019s call & to those who continue to keep us safe. Today we celebrate our nation\u2019s symbol of our freedom. Happy Flag Day! Very serious and dangerous situation in and around Yellowstone right now. I\u2019m praying that everyone stays safe and for all affected by this flooding. Check here for the latest updates from NPS: The January Select Committee has not issued a conclusion regarding potential criminal referrals. We will announce a decision on that at an appropriate time. The former President did not condemn the attack on the Capitol building. He justified it. We take an Oath to defend the United States Constitution. That Oath must mean something. To my Republican colleagues defending the indefensible: there will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain. We must remember what's at stake. Brave men and women have fought and died for our nation. We must honor them by maintaining the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power and ensure that what happened on Jan. never happens again. When a President fails to take the steps necessary to preserve our union, or worse, causes a constitutional crisis, we are at a moment of maximum danger for our Republic. My deepest condolences go out to the family of Buffalo's Seth Rasmuson & the other Marines involved in this tragic accident. Seth's service to our country will never be forgotten. Please join me in praying for Seth\u2019s loved ones as they grieve his loss. years ago, Allied Forces stormed the beaches of Normandy to fight for a free world. May we always remember the bravery and the sacrifice of the Greatest Generation. This moment is a moral test for the Republican Party because of the mortal threat we face - and right now, there are too many in my party who are failing it. At this time of testing, we have to make a decision about whether we are going to put our love of this country above partisanship. There is no gray area. Every American should be able to say that we love our country more. Hardworking families are burdened with these high gas prices & high energy costs. We must ramp up our domestic energy production to combat these record high prices. Wyoming Indian High School celebrated its graduating class last weekend. Congratulations & best of luck to these seniors! Happy Beef Month! There's no better way to celebrate than by thanking our Wyoming ranchers who help feed the world. I introduced legislation last year to allow state-inspected meat to be sold across state lines to open up new markets & to support our livestock producers.

Companies around the world want access to America's market, and they're setting up shop close to home. This is good news for our economy. Main Street is open for business\u2014and the world knows it. So great to join this weekend to celebrate the start of Black History Month. It was a wonderful event, and a time for us to celebrate the contributions made by Black Americans.

I look forward to working with you on issues of mutual interest to the United States and El Salvador. After reading the California State Auditor's report alleging that the City of Anaheim improperly managed public funds, I'm calling for an immediate federal investigation. Every Anaheim resident should know how their tax dollars are being spent. We need transparency. The health and safety of OC families is my number one priority, and the recent Tustin hangar fire could jeopardize our community. and I called on Gov Newsom to declare a State of Emergency\u2014our constituents deserve more funding and support. We\u2019re facing a health care crisis\u2014with doctor shortages, and limited access to care. And Medicare reimbursement cuts are only making it worse. It means doctors seeing fewer Medicare patients, or operating at a loss\u2014and it\u2019s hurting Main Street. We need to reverse these cuts. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. used his voice to inspire generations to fight for equality, and stand together in our fight against hate. Today, and every day, we must remember his legacy, and pledge to continue our work to bring his dream to life. Data shows immigrants are driving workforce growth nationally and in California. It\u2019s clear that they are the key to keeping our economy stop. Immigrants are ready to contribute to our economy. It's up to Congress to let them. I've listened to my colleagues\u2014but the facts are just not there. Instead of a sham impeachment, we should be working toward real immigration reform. The global migration crisis requires real solutions\u2014not political theater. Let's put political showmanship aside and get to work. Today marks three years since the one of the greatest attacks on our Capitol since the War of I was in the House chamber that day, and refused to leave our constitutional duty unfulfilled. We almost lost our democracy\u2014and since, I\u2019ve never stopped fighting to protect it. BREAKING: The VA just announced it will start funding research for psychedelic treatment for PTSD and depression. This is huge. These substances show a possibility to cure veterans of their invisible wounds\u2014and may be the first step toward tackling mental health crisis head-on. . and I have pushed the VA to research the impact of breakthrough therapies like these for years. In fact, the House passed our amendment to do just that last year. We won\u2019t stop until these life-saving therapies are accessible to all who would benefit from them. I'm so incredibly proud of what we accomplished this year. From delivering millions for community projects, to attending nearly events across our community, this year has been a busy one. I can't wait to see what we accomplish together next year. Wishing all celebrating here in Orange County, and around the country, a very Merry Christmas! From my family, to yours. May your holiday be filled with warmth, comfort, and joy. President Biden must advocate for American companies and workers\u2014and insist that the E.U. administer their digital policies fairly. We cannot jeopardize the our national economy, diminish our global leadership, or jeopardize the security of consumers. I just joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues in voting to pass the NDAA\u2014to strengthen our national security, support our allies in Europe and the Middle East, and give our servicemembers a well-overdue raise. I\u2019ll never leave them behind. My Republican colleagues inaction has made our border less secure, and less humane. I condemn this attempt to terrorize immigrant communities, cut off legal pathways, and turn our back on refugees fleeing violence and persecution in the strongest possible terms. Thrilled to stop by a hidden gem in Santa Ana this Systems, our community's gateway to space innovation. They support over jobs here, and develop parachute systems used by NASA and the military, including the historic NASA Mars Perseverance landing! As menorahs are lit across Orange County, I hope all observing Hanukkah share peace and joy together\u2014and may light fill your home with brightness, and your hearts with hope as you celebrate with those you love. I'm wishing your family a season of love, laughter and light. Every year, Toys for Tots delivers hope to kids across the country. So happy to stop by and deliver toys ahead of the holidays, and encourage my colleagues here in Washington to do the same.

It is my objective to uncover all the facts.\u2026 My office is working diligently to ensure these mail delivery breakdowns are quickly resolved, and Postmaster General DeJoy can come to Georgia to check out the service impacts himself. Bidenomics is wreaking the economy and pricing hardworking American families out of the American Dream. Our nation cannot afford this poor economic leadership any longer. Congratulations to the Cobb County Library system! The SEC is not a climate regulator. Pres. Biden's failure to replenish our Strategic Petroleum Reserve is yet another example of this weakening of our nation\u2019s security. will continue pushing to unleash American energy production. Bidenomics continues to fan the flames of inflation and Americans are draining their retirement savings to afford this astronomical cost of living. are committed to providing economic relief to American families. Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas is about ensuring that those who defy their oath of office and violate the public trust are held to the highest degree of accountability. It's past time for the Senate to hold his impeachment trial. We have lost a true American hero, Lt. Commander Lou Conter, the last survivor of the USS Arizona. During that fateful day at Pearl Harbor, his bravery saved many lives aboard the battleship. HE IS RISEN! Desiree and I wish you and your loved ones a blessed and happy Easter! On #GoodFriday, we remember the day Jesus willingly suffered and died as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. It's a welcome reminder that even during the darkest of times, hope always prevails. Congratulations to our extraordinarily talented student artists from across who participated in the Congressional Art Competition. I\u2019m truly inspired by their passion and proudly commend their hard work. The number of illegal immigrants in the United States is up under Pres. Biden\u2019s Administration. It\u2019s long past time the President takes action to end this unprecedented crisis. From day one, President Biden has waged war on our domestic energy production, causing prices to skyrocket and draining our Strategic Petroleum Reserves. For the sake of America\u2019s economic and national security, we must restore our energy dominance. Inflation has risen since President Biden took office. American families need real relief. Instead of running a genuine investigation looking into U.S. Capitol security failures on the former Select Committee chased false political narratives. We are getting to the truth. Unlike Pelosi's Select Committee, who spent millions on false political narratives, our investigation will continue exposing the whole truth, and the American people can decide for themselves. I voted No. Reports of alleged mail theft at the Marietta Post Office and mail delays throughout the state are deeply concerning and warrant more transparency from USPS to those affected. My office is working diligently to ensure these matters are quickly resolved. It is unfortunate the Select Committee chased false political narratives instead of the important work of a genuine investigation. My op-ed discusses how Americans need the full truth about The former Select Committee promoted hearsay and cherry-picked information to promote their predetermined narrative. Last week\u2019s report is just the beginning in our mission to uncover the full truth. The former Select Committee did not report on the security failures surrounding the DNC/RNC pipe bombs. We are looking for answers. All options are on the table as we continue pursuing full transparency and accountability. These major violations of public trust cannot go unanswered. Desiree and I, along with our family and team, are praying for our friend, Georgia\u2019s Labor Commisioner . As we continue our investigation, all options are on the table to hold members of the former Select Committee, and others, accountable. We will leave no stone unturned in delivering the full truth about Every freedom-loving American, and especially the press, should be deeply concerned by the persecution and prosecution of \u2019s , an independent journalist working to get the truth. This blatant assault on freedom of the press must end. . & have launched an investigation into the unjust treatment of journalist . Instead of targeting him for his reporting, the DOJ should focus its time on finding the suspects in the RNC/DNC pipe bomb & gallows investigations. I appreciate the steadfast support, ! As we progress in our investigation, we will continue pushing for full transparency and accountability. The American people have a right to know the complete truth about what really happened on January The former Select Committee spent two years and millions of dollars, but their investigation into the pipe bombs was non-existent. Today\u2019s hearing was about ensuring Americans get to hear the full truth. When the former Select Committee heard critical testimony on Pres. Trump\u2019s push for National Guard troops to secure the Capitol, they suppressed it. We will continue getting to the truth no matter where it leads. Tune in LIVE to our hearing on the many unanswered questions in the DNC/RNC pipe bomb Years Later: Assessing the Law Enforcement Response to Multiple Pipe Bombs on January The former Select Committee operated in an unprecedented way, vetoing GOP appointments, hiring Hollywood producers to promote their false narrative, and refusing to adopt committee rules. This was never about running a real investigation. New evidence shows the former Select Committee intentionally held back key witness testimony that did not corroborate Cassidy Hutchinson\u2019s dramatic account of President Trump\u2019s actions that day. We will continue to uncover the facts. Evidence indicates the Select Committee intentionally suppressed critical testimony about President Trump\u2019s push for National Guard troops. We will continue to uncover the truth. We did send a border bill. H.R. is languishing on \u2019s desk. We have a vision for the future Mr. President, and it doesn\u2019t include you or your party\u2019s disastrous policies. We want a secure nation where our children can be safe and have freedom and opportunity! Despite Biden\u2019s purported stance against China, he allowed the surveillance balloon to traverse the entire continental United States. That doesn\u2019t sound very \u201ctough\u201d on China. #SOTU So, Mr. President \u2014 You\u2019re going to send US military personnel to Gaza to build a port. Are you just going to pull out and leave them stranded like those you left in Afghanistan? #SOTU President Biden agreed to unfreeze in assets to Iran, the world\u2019s number one state sponsor of terrorism. The primary role of a is to ensure the protection of America\u2019s homeland, yet he puts Americans in danger by appeasing our enemies. Instead of improving America\u2019s domestic port infrastructure, the Biden Administration is spending taxpayer dollars to build a seaport in Gaza, where Hamas still has operational control. The heinous October attack on Israel must not go unpunished. That\u2019s why I supported in emergency funding to Israel. Our alliance with Israel is more than just supporting an ally. It\u2019s about preserving freedom, liberty, and security for both of our nations. #SOTU Mr President \u2014 you actually just claimed that America is safer now under your leadership? I can\u2019t even find the words to describe how out of touch you really are! #SOTU Make no mistake: President Biden will not stop until he strips all Americans of their Second Amendment rights. and I will never let that happen. #SOTU President Trump secured the border \u2014 you won\u2019t! Stop blaming everyone else for your failure to do your job. #SOTU Under President Biden's Administration, illegal immigrants have crossed our southern border, creating an unprecedented national security crisis. It's long past time for the President to exercise his existing executive to put an end to this madness. #SOTU President Biden has willfully failed to secure our southern border and ordered his subordinates to do the same. His open border polices are to blame for these unprecedented national security and humanitarian crises at the border. Mr. President, you don\u2019t need legislation to secure the border. President Trump did it with the same laws we have now! What you need is the will to do it! #SOTU There\u2019s no bigger junk fee than the added expense to American families caused by #Bidenflation every day. President Biden\u2019s tax policy is clear: Cracking down on private businesses and free money for those who don\u2019t work. #SOTU Mr. President, over the past days, the total national debt has increased by trillion. Where are you getting all this money you are committing to hand out? Answer: stealing from the middle class taxpayers you just said you \u2018loved.\u2019 #SOTU Mr. President, if you cared about the Middle Class, you would stop your administration from continuing to spy on our every financial transaction. What I buy, and when I buy it, is none of your business. #SOTU Americans are being ravaged by the consequences of the Biden Admin\u2019s poor economic policies. President Biden blames private business for Shrinkflation, but he should take a long look in the mirror to see who\u2019s responsible. #SOTU Since President Biden took office, inflation has caused prices to rise overall. Electricity Food Household rent American families need real relief, and Bidenomics is only making the problem worse. Mr. President, I do love my country, that\u2019s why I am exposing the truth about January #SOTU Your wide open border, Mr. President, is the greatest threat to our families and our freedom. Much greater than Jan It was great chatting with and \u2019s yesterday at the Media Row ahead of tonight\u2019s State of the Union.

The Supreme Court today reaffirmed the constitutional principle that Americans have a right to vote for the candidate of their choice without interference. As our investigation progresses, we will continue to keep our promise of ensuring full transparency for all Americans by: Making all U.S. Capitol Police CCTV footage from public. Ensuring there\u2019s complete accountability for politicization & unjust targeting by DOJ. My subcommittee\u2019s investigation has always been about providing the American people with full transparency about January I appreciate \u2019s continued support. Today\u2019s release is a critical step forward in our effort to uncover the truth. Laken Hope Riley was a special young lady \u2014 a gifted and exemplary student, a talented athlete, and the light of her family and community. & I led a moment of silence tonight with the entire Georgia delegation to honor her memory. May she rest in eternal peace. These revelations are extremely troubling and raise even more important questions about the DNC/RNC pipe bomb investigation. My investigation will continue to rigorously seek the truth. The American people deserve full transparency. Laken Riley\u2019s brutal murder by an illegal immigrant has sent shockwaves across our state and nation. I led my Georgia colleagues in demanding the President secure our southern border now. The DOJ has no suspects in either the RNC/DNC pipe bomb nor gallows investigation, but they are targeting an independent journalist who simply documented what he witnessed on January There were dozens of journalists at the Capitol that day, so why target ? Mr. President, instead of making excuses for her murder, and defending policies that weaken our immigration laws, we must ensure justice for Laken by first securing our border. Desiree and I were shocked and heartbroken to learn of the murder of Laken Riley, UGA student from Woodstock. We are praying for Laken\u2019s family and friends during this tremendously difficult time. We appreciate every member of law enforcement who worked quickly to apprehend the\u2026 The construction of the gallows on Jan. raises serious and troubling questions. Why wasn\u2019t it taken down all that day, and why haven't those who constructed it been identified? We will get answers.

See my full statement New footage that raises more serious and troubling questions. How could a bomb-sniffing dog miss a pipe bomb at the DNC? We\u2019ll add this to our long list of unanswered questions and continue getting to the truth. On this day, years ago, James Oglethorpe arrived in Savannah and established the colony of Georgia. Happy Georgia Day! Happy Birthday President Abraham Lincoln! He led our nation with humility and grace though some of its darkest days. Let us reflect on his legacy, commitment to freedom, and unwavering vision to move our nation closer toward that more perfect union. He did convince the President of Mexico to open the gates, but it wasn\u2019t in Gaza! The Special Counsel\u2019s findings about President Biden\u2019s conduct with classified documents, and commentary on his faculties should concern us all. Our national security depends on having a fully cognizant at all times. The recently uncovered information regarding Fulton County, GA DA Fani Willis almost reads like a corrupt political novel. Her apparent coordination with the Select Committee is also of concern. The American people want the truth. Pres. Biden could start by utilizing these eight executive authorities if he actually wants to address the border. Happy Birthday to President Ronald Reagan! His strong leadership and unwavering commitment to freedom inspired me to serve. Today, let us continue fighting to protect the American Dream and ensure it\u2019s passed down to the next generation. Despite big tech\u2019s interference, we will not be deterred from our goal to give the American people full transparency and complete accountability about what really happened on January They deserve nothing less, no matter where the evidence leads. My colleagues and I told President Biden the truth: He could solve the unprecedented humanitarian and national security crises at the border TODAY by using the authority he already has to enforce our existing immigration laws. We must secure the border now. Why is big tech against our investigation into uncovering the truth about what really happened on January The American people have the right to know the complete story. Everyone is better off when we all row in the same direction. That\u2019s why AI frameworks across the Legislative Branch must be streamlined, to ensure our complicated processes run as smoothly and efficiently as possible.

The best is yet to come. White Supremacy is one of the most insidious threats to our democracy. Tragically, there are now more than hate groups operating in the United States and the number is on the rise. Congress must continue to shed light on this growing problem and come up with substantive solutions. There is no room in this country for hate, violence, and discrimination.

In NY and across the country, rising interest rates are impacting homeowners, home buyers, and even renters. As mortgage rates have increased by nearly two basis points, the median home price rose by over One solution to open the doors of homeownership to more Americans would be to allow for a mortgage option which would bring down the cost of interest payments for low-income home buyers, compared to the traditional mortgage. Paid sick leave is a right. Railroad workers who keep our nation\u2019s economy moving have endured long hours with shamefully low pay & benefits for years. We should have their back.

This month\u2019s CPI report shows that inflation is beginning to ease and with the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS Act, and bipartisan infrastructure bill prices will decline further.

We can't double down on fossil fuels heating the planet and polluting neighborhoods like NYC's Asthma Alley.

Let's make use of these standards to rapidly deploy zero-pollution energy and create millions of good union jobs.

Bidenflation just keeps climbing \u2014 and Michiganders are paying the price for it. \u201cA Hot Inflation Report Is a Blow to President Biden\u201d Incendiary rhetoric like we saw this past weekend fuels further radicalization, with an year old in Idaho pledging allegiance to ISIS being only the latest example. The Biden-Slotkin open border is making matters worse. Watch my interview on Fox and Friends this morning Praying for a quick recovery for these heroes who were shot in the line of duty today in Lansing. Violent crime cannot be allowed to take hold in our communities, we must do everything we can to support law enforcement! Border security = national security. To the heroes who have given more for the promise of freedom than many of us could imagine, we thank you. I am proud to have one of Michigan\u2019s greatest conservative champions on my team! \"Michiganders have suffered from the same status quo in the U.S. Senate for decades.

And I will be proud to serve my home in the U.S. Senate. Handling the threat posed by Communist China will take a leader with experience and backbone \u2014 not a pawn who will sell their country out to the highest bidder. That\u2019s why it is so important that we defeat Biden and Slotkin in November. If Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin won\u2019t do what is necessary to protect America\u2019s national security \u2014 the least they could do is get out of the way. Go get \u2018em !

Excited to get to work with you and deliver for Northern Michigan and U.P. families! Once again, Michigan families are falling victim to violent criminals who should not even be in our country in the first place. The Biden-Slotkin open border agenda is putting Michiganders at risk. This year, the federal government will pay over billion in interest. That\u2019s more than we will spend on national security! Biden\u2019s broken economy isn\u2019t just bad for our wallets \u2014 it\u2019s bad for our safety. Newsflash for : Communist China is no friend to the United States. And no elected member of Congress has any business signing shady secret agreements involving the CCP. President Trump is right: My focus is on defeating Elissa Slotkin in November and putting a stop to the Biden-Slotkin job-killing EV mandates. President Trump will deliver a clear contrast between his plan to secure the border and Biden\u2019s unending chaos. Thanks for the shout out, Mr. President! Excited to get to work with you to secure our southern border and protect Michigan communities. He is Risen! Let us always remember those who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. God bless our law enforcement officers. Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer are dumping millions into Elissa Slotkin\u2019s warchest. Will you help me fend off their attacks before our end of quarter deadline? Here we go again. The Biden-Slotkin open border has allowed cartel crime to thrive right here in Michigan. We must secure the border now to protect our communities. Onward! Congrats to the Spartans, and good luck, Michigan!

Every day that Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin are in office is another day that our national security is at risk. We must secure the southern border! Communist China is no friend to the United States. Listen to my conversation with about the growing threat of the CCP below The threat of Communist China grows worse and worse by the day. Meanwhile, weak leaders like Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin sit back and let it happen. I\u2019ve been standing up to Communist China for decades \u2014 and you can bet that I\u2019ll continue that work in the Senate. My heart goes out to Ruby & her family. She lost her life in a preventable & infuriating tragedy, allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant. How many more must lose their lives to the Biden border crisis? He has the tools to secure the border today! My deepest condolences to the victims and their families of this morning\u2019s tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. I\u2019m beyond thankful for the first responders in Maryland as they continue their heroic work to save lives. I\u2019ve got leaders like , and on my team. But I still need grassroots supporters to step up and help me secure a victory in November. Fire Chuck Schumer and join Team Rogers: ! This is a significant time in our history as we compete with China, and I know with the Gotion plant in his district, John is ready and willing to call out their deceit and hold China accountable. Kristi and I are wishing each and every one of you a blessed Palm Sunday. The national debt is out of control. The border crisis is out of control.The crime wave is out of control. And we\u2019re supposed to believe that Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin can suddenly turn things around? Give me a break. Last night, Democrats voted unanimously in support of continuing to endanger our national and personal security by allowing criminal cartels into our neighborhoods. Democrats are not serious about securing the border. Michiganders are fed up with Joe Biden. Biden will be a one-term president because he and folks like Elissa Slotkin have turned their backs on the American people. Iconic trucks like the Silverado, & Ram are set to be banned thanks to the Biden-Slotkin EV mandate. Vehicles are one of the most expensive items Americans will buy in their lives, we should have choices, not mandates. What a win, congrats Greg Kampe and the Oakland Grizzlies on their historic upset! Special day for the State of Michigan in the NCAA Tournament! Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin are dead set on America being energy dependent on other nations. And Michigan families are being forced to pump their paychecks away as a result. We still have a long way to go, but there is no denying that the momentum is on our side. In November, President Trump and I will kick Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin out of Washington! The Biden-Slotkin EV mandate will kill Michigan auto jobs and enrich China. This desperate move to get votes in isn\u2019t fooling anyone.

Listen to it here The Biden-Slotkin EV mandates are bad for Michigan. From blueberries to cherries to the dairy that makes America's ice cream, Michigan's Ag industry is among the most diverse and productive in the country. On this National Ag Day, here\u2019s my promise to you: In the Senate, I will fight with everything I have for the Michiganders\u2026 Michigan residents stood up to say NO to China setting up shop in their community. Now they\u2019re being sued by a massive Chinese corporation. Don\u2019t expect to stand up for Green Township, she signed a secret agreement to help make it happen. In just four years, Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin have rolled out the red carpet for illegal immigrants, potential terrorists, and criminal cartels at our southern border. Imagine what sending them back to Washington will mean for our nation next. It\u2019s past time Joe Biden declares Tren da Aragua for what it is: An international criminal organization, terrorizing Americans. Maduro is emptying his prisons and flooding America with dangerous criminals through our wide open border. Enough is enough. Michiganders are feeling the weight of Biden and Slotkin\u2019s policies at the gas pump \u2014 and they\u2019re fed up! Wishing each of you a little luck on this St. Patrick's Day! Spent this evening at the Monroe Ducks Unlimited Spring Banquet with Tim Walberg. Great Americans passionate about conserving wetlands and wildlife for future generations. The willful ignorance that we have seen come from leaders like Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin surrounding the border crisis is shameful. We can\u2019t trust these two in Washington. They\u2019ve proven that they will put their own political interest over our national security. China is the greatest threat to America\u2019s national and economic security. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve spent my career working to hold China accountable and put the American people first. But we cannot let up, we must win this competition. Justice Viviano has served the people of Michigan on our highest court with honor, integrity, and most of all, fairness. His legal acumen and commitment to the rule of law are second to none. I congratulate him on his retirement and am thankful for his many years of service. Wonderful time celebrating St. Patrick\u2019s Day with Paul W. Smith and in Detroit! Statement from Mike Rogers: Once again, hits the nail on the head. Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin rolled out the red carpet for these violent gangs to enter our country illegally \u2014 and Americans are paying the price for it. I've spent my career in the public and private sector taking on China and the companies it controls, and I won't back down now! Read my op-ed on the clear and present danger that China presents to the U.S., and what we can do about it. Watch my interview on this morning where we talked about Biden\u2019s disastrous EV mandates and my recent endorsement from President Trump! My statement on Biden\u2019s visit to Saginaw. Reminder: The federal debt has gotten so large that spending on interest to service that debt now exceeds federal spending on national defense. This should be sounding alarms all over DC. But instead \u2013 we get more of the very same tax and spend policies from the very same\u2026 Happy Day, Motor City! I agree with . If truly cared about protecting Michiganders from China, she\u2019d join us in calling for the Gotion plant to be stopped immediately and halt U.S. taxpayer money from paying for it! Wishing my beautiful wife Kristi a happy birthday today! She is incredibly generous, accomplished, and loving \u2014 and there is no one else I would rather have by my side. The American people aren\u2019t buying what Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin are selling. Not just because inflation has made it unaffordable \u2014 but because they see straight through the lies. . just refused to condemn Joe Biden for the crisis he created at the southern border. This was a bipartisan vote, but once again, Slotkin sided with Biden and extreme Democrats over Michigan families. ! This is a big win for Michigan workers and I know you will continue to serve us well on this important committee with fellow Michigander ! Thank you for the endorsement, ! Now is the time to unite to defeat the Biden-Slotkin agenda. Together we will secure the border, stop Bidenomics, end the EV mandates, and build a strong and bright future for all Michiganders! Thank you, Mr. President! Excited to get to work with you to Get America and Michigan Back on Track! Joe Biden\u2019s border disaster is costing American lives. He can\u2019t run from this issue any longer. It\u2019s time we hold him accountable. This campaign is powered by grassroots supporters! Get your Team Rogers merch to help spread our message: Michiganders deserve better than what Joe Biden and Elissa Slotkin have to offer. Their leadership has failed all of us. Had a great time supporting State Rep. Joe Aragona in Macomb. And it\u2019s always great to see my friend Candice Miller! If Joe Biden thinks he\u2019s been a successful President, he\u2019s not living in the same reality as we are. Biden\u2019s been a disaster for our economy, national security, and public safety. I\u2019m glad that was there to debunk Biden\u2019s lies and hold him accountable for his\u2026 Laken Riley\u2019s tragic death was preventable. #SayHerName Thanks to the folks at Alloy Construction in Midland for the tour of their facilities today. This is just one of the incredible small businesses that keep Michigan moving! Joe Biden might be speaking tonight, but all eyes are on Alabama as my friend Katie Britt gets ready to rebut his lies. From a wide-open border to levels of inflation that would make a tire shop jealous, Biden has a lot to answer for, and will be there to take\u2026 We\u2019ve both spent our entire careers serving and protecting our community, our state, and this great nation. We know what strong leadership looks like, and it\u2019s why we\u2019re on the same team. Read the op/ed from me and below Chinese espionage efforts are pervasive and growing. They\u2019ve already stole more than trillion in American intellectual property. We must take this threat seriously to defend American interests. Under Joe Biden\u2019s leadership, America\u2019s border and skies have been left wide open. When the leader of the free world projects weakness, our adversaries take advantage. Congratulations President Trump on winning the GOP Primary! The choice between Trump and Biden could not be more clear. Trump secured the border, Biden let in illegals, deadly fentanyl, and stimulated a massive crime wave. Trump had the economy booming, Biden raised\u2026 Joe Biden\u2019s open border is more than just a humanitarian crisis \u2014 it\u2019s a national security crisis too. We must ensure the safety of American families by securing our border. Proud to have the endorsement of a true crimefighter like . Listen to his endorsement of my campaign with ! James Craig is a true son of Detroit who built a long and distinguished career in law enforcement that brought significant change, safety, and security to Detroit \u2014 and I am honored to have his endorsement. Joe Biden & Kamala Harris\u2019 dereliction of duty is driving the border crisis. But you don\u2019t have to take my word for it.

Was so glad to see representatives from and today in DC. The artisans at the annual Sylacauga Magic of Marble Festival were spectacular as usual! Fun fact: Sylacauga marble is among the best in the country and can be found in the Lincoln Memorial and the U.S. Supreme Court building. This year\u2019s district-wide art competition was incredibly close, but I am excited to share that this piece by a student from Saint Clair County High School will hang in the US Capitol Building for the next year. students never cease to amaze! I\u2019ve seen what the UAW has done to Detroit, and I don\u2019t want any of what they\u2019re selling. Under Gov. Ivey\u2019s leadership, Alabama now leads the nation in car exports. The UAW is attacking her because they would like nothing more than to bring all that growth to a halt. The Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce is hard at work to keep Alabama on top, and it is always my pleasure to speak with these local leaders. I was honored to speak with students in Professor Owens\u2019 class at about the challenges the United States faces in the Middle East. The future of and our country is bright! He is risen! Wishing a blessed and happy Easter to all of Hoping all of you have a peaceful Good Friday today. This is part of the horrifying reality of living in a country with open borders. How many young women have to fall prey to these criminals for Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas to do their jobs and enforce our country\u2019s immigration laws? On this Medal of Honor Day, I wanted to recognize Opelika\u2019s own Bennie Adkins. CSM Adkins went far beyond the call of duty in service of his country. Working to ensure he received this well-deserved decoration is one of my proudest moments in Congress. On this day in an tornado tore through the Jacksonville community and the campus. I am forever proud of how our community came together and recovered better than ever. Happy #NationalAgDay! The agriculture industry brings billions of dollars of business to Alabama and every year. I am incredibly grateful for these hard workers\u2019 contributions to our community, and I am proud to be a friend to the agricultural community. War Eagle! So proud of and excited to watch them take on the rest of the NCAA. I am extremely proud that is a community. Amazing work from the city of Auburn to help veterans seek new employment opportunities. Loved seeing leaders from the city of Gadsden in DC to discuss how we can work together for our region! GE Aerospace just announced a million investment in their Auburn, AL facility! I met with their team in DC to discuss our mutual love of the city of Auburn and how we can work together for Love the extra hour of sunlight, but time changes are an unnecessary nuisance. Congress should pass my legislation to allow states to observe Daylight Savings Time or Standard Time year-round immediately. As expected, knocked it out of the park. I cannot help but note the stark differences between the honest, authentic, caring, and insightful words shared by Senator Britt and the shameless string of lies spoken by Biden. Alabama is lucky to have leaders like her! The Afghanistan Withdrawal remains one of the most tragic examples of Biden\u2019s fatal incompetence. These families are still searching for the answers they deserve. My heart is with them every day, and I was honored to meet with them today. Huge thanks to and for including them as their State of the Union guests. Too many families struggle every day with the aftermath of crimes committed by illegal migrants with no respect for our laws or people. I joined my colleagues in voting for the Laken Riley Act to ensure ICE detains these criminals before it\u2019s too late. Four years ago today, the Beauregard community was devastated by an tornado. The strength exhibited by this community will never be forgotten. In her first term in the Senate, has proven herself to be a natural leader and a fighter for America. I can\u2019t think of a more fitting person to be the first Alabamian to deliver the State of the Union rebuttal, and I\u2019m excited to tune in. Happy birthday to one of my favorite residents! Our state benefits from one of the most well-trained and innovative manufacturing workforces in the country. I was excited to see what Gadsden State Community College is doing to keep Alabama on the cutting edge of production. If you\u2019re still asking why is so concerned about the border crisis, you\u2019re not paying attention. These are the kinds of criminals that are entering our country and making themselves at home in your backyard. Every single state is a border state. The Northeast Alabama Regional MegaSite in Etowah County represents a huge economic opportunity for our area. These local leaders are dedicated to seeing our community grow, and I am excited to do everything I can to support their efforts! Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. I loved speaking with local business leaders in Etowah County about how I can support Alabama small businesses at the federal level. This is a man that shouldn\u2019t even be in the country, but was allowed in due to Biden\u2019s open border policies. He should still be in prison in New York for injuring a child, but was released due to Alvin Bragg\u2019s woke bail policies. Our country needs President Trump\u2019s policies! I signed on to this letter because the American people already know Biden is cognitively challenged, but we need to be informed whether or not the man with our nuclear launch codes is lucid. Alabama stands with Texas. Yesterday, the city of Oxford celebrated their birthday and I could not be prouder of this piece of the community. Here\u2019s to more! Secretary Mayorkas deserved every single vote in favor of his impeachment that he got.

A special shoutout to the Dixons and Loveladys of These young families are the future of farming! Part of the reason I love my job so much are the amazing leaders at the community level. I was excited to hear from several of these dedicated public servants in Etowah County this morning. Alejandro Mayorkas is derelict in his duty. As Secretary of Homeland Security, he is responsible for the Biden border crisis. I will vote to impeach him today, tomorrow, and every day the border stays wide open. This bust is perhaps one of my favorite office decorations. It reminds me of how much good we can do up here if we do things right. Today, on President Reagan\u2019s birthday, I am especially thankful for his lasting legacy. I\u2019d be the first person in 's cheering section! The best weeks in DC are those when I get to see as many Alabamians as possible. Thanks to the folks from Anniston for making the trip! This is what happens when the Biden Border Crisis and the Dem-Run City Crime Crisis intersect. Loved having the St. Clair County Commission in DC. As a former county commissioner myself, I know the hard work that these people put in for their community. ., two of finest grads, have been a mainstay on my radio for years. I am sad to see them go but excited to see what the future holds for them! I was happy to meet with Helena Duncan of BCA to discuss the threats Alabama businesses are facing and how we can keep Alabama thriving. The current situation at the southern border is a national security disaster waiting to happen. The forensics center at is a cutting edge resource for students and local law enforcement (it\u2019s also very cool).

I am amazed by the all work Alabama Child Food Solutions does to combat child food insecurity in Central Alabama. They are a true example of paying it forward and I was delighted to receive a tour of their facility. No step too high for a high stepper! I\u2019m with our Governor, and I\u2019m thankful Texas is stepping up to secure our border while the Biden Administration twiddles their thumbs. The community leaders in Sylacauga are incredibly passionate about their community. I loved getting to speak with them to discuss the upcoming year. I will be keeping my day job, but I had a great time touring the welding facilities at ! As a reminder, border patrol agents only catch about half of what comes through our border (including fentanyl). Biden\u2019s border crisis gets deadlier every day and his willful ignorance gets more and more disgusting. As many Alabamians gather on the National Mall today for the March for Life, I could not be prouder to have received an \u201cA+\u201d rating from . The fight for the innocent lives of the unborn is far from over, and I will continue to be a voice for the voiceless. Pell City\u2019s leaders are hard at work for their hometown. I\u2019m always happy to talk with them about how I can best support cities at the federal level. I voted in favor of denouncing the Biden open border. This is a national security disaster waiting to happen, and it is past time for the \u201ccommander in chief\u201d to correct course on his moronic border policies. The Biden administration continues to lie to the American people about the crisis at our Southern border. The stark reality is Joe Biden\u2019s open border policy is a disaster that is only getting worse. . is a great resource for those dealing with Alabama\u2019s temperamental weather! I will be closely monitoring conditions in and I suggest every household ensure they have a tornado plan in place. From the entire state of Alabama, thank you, Coach Saban. Law enforcement officers place their lives on the line every day for the safety of their neighbors. I am proud to be a strong supporter of law enforcement today and every single day. So cool! Huge congrats to . Way to do proud! . are hard at work on equipping our military to face threats and weeding out the asinine, woke policies of the Biden Administration. I was proud to discuss this with Central Alabamians at the Rotary Club of Birmingham. China unjustly executes thousands per year, including nonviolent offenders, all while committing genocide. So naturally, the UN Human Rights Council is focusing their efforts on stopping a humane method of execution on a convicted murderer in Alabama.", "I respectfully disagree with both Republicans and Democrats who oppose legislation to ban Tik Tok if it remains under the control of its Chinese-owner ByteDance. Under Chinese law, the Chinese Communist Party has complete control and access over ByteDance and, therefore, Tik Tok.\u2026 The Annual Congressional Art Competition is underway! District high school artists can submit entries until the deadline on Friday, April We simply cannot afford billion dollar stumbles in our efforts to modernize the Army. At yesterday's Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on the Army's budget request, I expressed my frustration with recent failed programs. We must innovate rapidly and successfully. You can learn more about the steps you can take at home or your business to protect the desert tortoise here: Terrific work, Leighton! It's great to see the inspire visitors of all ages to take simple steps, like keeping trash covered, to help conserve our threatened species. Only of Californians think the quality of education in our state has improved in the last few years despite record high levels of funding. I support school choice because I believe we should empower parents to make the best decision for their family. It\u2019s always great to welcome the Monday Morning Group to Washington, D.C. and collaborate with this group of Riverside County community leaders on how to address the challenges facing our region. As a California Aerospace Caucus Co-Chair, I\u2019m proud to work in a bipartisan manner to introduce this resolution supporting National Space Day. Our state has a proud history in launching the innovation & discoveries that have propelled America\u2019s leadership in space exploration. \"You don\u2019t need a business degree to see there\u2019s little cost relief.\" #Bidenomics American's continue to fall behind under President Biden's disastrous economic policies. Using the latest economic data, the Joint Economic Committee estimates that the average household in California is paying more per month to purchase the same basket of goods and services than they did when President Biden was sworn into office. #Bidenomics I had the pleasure of meeting yesterday with Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth and Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George in advance of the Defense Department budget hearings I\u2019ll be holding as Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I also met with Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Eric Smith, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti. Here's my statement congratulating my good friend on being named the new Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee: This study found Democrats who control Sacramento spent billion of YOUR tax dollars to address homelessness but failed to put anything in place that \"tracked and evaluated the State\u2019s efforts to prevent and end homelessness.\" Is anyone surprised so little has improved? The million I was able to secure for the Coachella Valley Rail project will help move us closer to providing rail service connecting communities across the Valley. More work is needed, but I'm confident by working together we can get it done. America is blessed with some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. Today, the House of Representatives is set to pass the EXPLORE Act so that every American can enjoy access to what our nation offers. I will always fight to bring your tax dollars home to our region to build projects that provide solutions to our challenges. The million coming to back to the District is a result of collaboration with local leaders in CA and my bipartisan efforts back in DC. On Friday I had the pleasure of speaking at the Rancho Mirage Chamber of Commerce Legislative Business Breakfast. As a former small business owner I understand the challenges they face. That\u2019s why I will continue to advocate for solutions that help Coachella Valley job creators. The top priority today remains the same as it was six months ago: all of the hostages - including the women, children, and Americans - must be released by Hamas. Happy #OpeningDay ! Which SoCal team are you cheering for this season? As and I explain in this op-ed, we must prepare for a modern fight to preserve America\u2019s superiority. The fiscal Defense Appropriations Act funds these preparations. Thank you George Mello for your service to our country! It was an honor to join your friends and family today to celebrate your heroism and bravery! It was a privilege to present Corona resident and Army veteran George Mello with the Bronze Star Medal for his brave actions during the Korean War. My office was proud to play a small role in ensuring Mr. Mellow received the recognition he earned serving our country. The evil of Hamas must never be forgotten. Americans would never accept living next to a murdering, raping, and hostage taking terror group. So why would anyone expect Israelis to? Israel has every right to root out every last member of Hamas and defend its people. I'm praying for those impacted by the horrific collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. Thankful for the first responders who have worked tirelessly in the wake of this terrible accident. Disabled American Veterans Assistant National Legislative Director Marquis Barefield recently testified before a Subcommittee in support of the Stuck on Hold Act, H.R. my bill to reduce call wait times for Americans calling the VA and Social Security. Riverside County taxpayers have voted to increase local sales taxes and are paying tolls to finance critical infrastructure projects. How many of those projects could have been funded with the BILLIONS Democrats insist on wasting on this boondoggle? While overdue policy changes are necessary in CA to address the availability of insurance, I believe one step Congress should take is to pass the Proven Forest Management Act which reforms federal forest management practices that have contributed to this problem. My staff and I worked collaboratively with Indian Wells on the Whitewater Channel stabilization project to secure federal funding. This project will provide the community with much needed protection from flood damage and encourage economic development for the region. On National Medal of Honor Day we honor and remember those brave Americans whose valiant acts have secured our country. I was proud to recognize these heroes by introducing the bill that was signed into law establishing the Medal of Honor Memorial at Riverside National Cemetery. According to new jobs market data, the unemployment rate in the Inland Empire is from to It's clear that the combination of Biden + Newsom administration policies are driving increased costs for small business owners which is resulting in fewer job opportunities. We learned on how deadly the actions of just a small number of terrorists can be. President Biden's failure to secure the border has created a national security threat. I wholeheartedly support Rep. Tom Cole as the next Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Tom is a friend, a scholar, a conservative, and a patriot. There is no better person to carry on the important work of our committee than Tom Cole and I look forward to his selection as\u2026 I want to thank Chairwoman Granger for her leadership, her guidance over the years, and her unwavering support of our men and women in uniform. She has been a fierce conservative who has delivered countless wins for our Conference and for our country. The Defense Appropriations bills funds vital defense programs, wins for our troops, historic funding for innovation and counter-drug activities, the focus on countering China. Its passage is a critical step forward for securing America in a dangerous time. No foreign activity is killing more Americans than the importation of fentanyl. The Defense Appropriations bill increases the role of the U.S. military as part of a approach to attacking the movement of fentanyl base chemicals produced in China and then\u2026 The men and women serving in our military are what truly separates our fighting force from any other in the world. The act invests in our most important assets with a pay raise to keep up with the increased cost-of-living, retention incentives and important family resources. The best way to leverage America\u2019s technological superiority into a military advantage is to disrupt the status quo in our weapons acquisition process and find new ways to deliver innovative tools more rapidly to our warfighters. I am proud of the historic investments included in\u2026 To counter a rising China, the Defense Appropriations bill: Maxes out production of critical munitions. Doubles security cooperation funding for Taiwan. Funds procurement of new battle force ships and rejects divestment of ships. The defense appropriations bill reflects my five priorities as Chairman: Countering China and staying ahead of our adversaries Prioritizing innovation for military superiority Achieving a more efficient and effective Pentagon Enhancing the military\u2019s role in\u2026 The Fiscal Year Defense Appropriations Act provides our military with the resources it needs to protect America and defend our interests around the globe. This package reinvests in our men and women in uniform and funds the capabilities necessary to secure our nation. Read\u2026 Under U.S. Code Section it is a federal crime for anyone who has been formally deported, excluded, or removed from the country, to re-enter the U.S. without proper authority. As the number of people illegally crossing our southern border has increased, the Biden\u2026 Today\u2019s Supreme Court ruling is a victory for the rule of law. If President Biden won\u2019t uphold his constitutional responsibility to secure our borders, then states, like Texas, have every right to uphold our laws and protect their citizens. I have and continue to believe the Riverside Transmission Reliability Project should be built underground to protect Norco residents from the added risk of wildfires. It's important for Norco residents and anyone else concerned about this project to voice their opinion with the\u2026 If your income hasn't increased by at least since Biden took office, you're falling behind. To stop inflation, I've opposed the runaway spending Biden and Democrats in Congress are pushing. I've also voted to increase American energy production to lower costs. Congratulations to the entire team on the exciting progress made with the third launch of Starship, the largest rocket to ever fly in space. Every time Californians look they add a few more billions to the price tag of this boondoggle. Riverside County taxpayers are being forced to fund this project that will not come anywhere near our region for decades - if ever. That's why I've strongly opposed funding it.

Call my office at Majority Leader Schumer\u2019s speech today calling for new elections in Israel is a wildly inappropriate attempt to interfere in a foreign democracy.

My prayers are with his family and friends. As we mourn his death, we strengthen our resolve to do everything possible to bring home all of the hostages. Last Congress, under President Biden and Congressional Democrats TRILLION was spent outside of the annual appropriations process. Biden said inflation was going to be \"transitory\" and signed into law even more spending via the poorly named \"Inflation Reduction Act.\" I met earlier today with Inland Action, a group of community leaders from the Inland Empire, who are in DC this week to advocate for our region. Our collaboration together has and will continue to advance solutions to our transportation, water, and environmental challenges. President Biden's proposed budget calls for nearly trillion in new taxes on American families and job creators. The last thing we should be doing as both families and job creators struggle to keep up with inflation is ask them to send more money to Washington. Americans understand that President Biden's open borders policies are putting us at risk. Neither President Biden nor the Senate has taken any action to secure the border. That has to change. What he should have done was secure the border. Not a perfect bill, but here\u2019s what I\u2019m pleased we achieved: Avoided a gov\u2019t shutdown Rejected President Biden\u2019s proposed spending increases million in roads, water infrastructure, and homeless projects for the District your tax dollars coming home I was honored to receive the Legislative Leader award from the Humane Society Legislative Fund at the #HumaneAwards earlier this week. I will keep fighting to protect animals and taxpayers from unnecessary animal testing using your tax dollars. I spoke with Steve Nikoui today, the Gold Star father of Kareem Nikoui, who was killed at the Abbey Gate bombing in Kabul. It\u2019s clear that Steve, like the other Abbey Gate Gold Star families, understandably continues to experience unimaginable grief, loss and frustration.\u2026 Brian Nestande dedicated his life to public service and advocating for the Coachella Valley. In addition to being elected to the California Assembly, Brian served as chief of staff to both Congressman Sonny Bono and Congresswoman Mary Bono. I had the pleasure of knowing and\u2026 Even in the absence of leadership from the White House, Congress must govern and fight for the issues Americans care about. That\u2019s why I will continue to stand firm against inflationary spending and take steps to lower the cost of energy by supporting domestic energy production.\u2026 I\u2019m deeply concerned that America\u2019s national security priorities are taking a backseat to Joe Biden\u2019s re-election priorities. The Biden campaign\u2019s presence on Tik Tok, which is owned by the Chinese Communist Party, and the fear of upsetting the radical leftists\u2026 After a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden\u2019s weak leadership has emboldened our adversaries in Iran, China, and Russia. We must respond to their aggression with strength and resolve along with our international allies. With nearly million illegal border crossings since Biden took office, we have seen pure chaos at the border, including individuals on the terrorist watch list and deadly drugs like fentanyl flowing across the border at alarming rates. Throughout our economy, American workers are failing to keep up with rising prices, which are up since President Biden took office. I\u2019m honored to have Idyllwild resident Stephanie Yost as my guest at tonight\u2019s State of the Union Address. Stephanie serves as the President of the nonprofit Idyllwild Community Center. It\u2019s people like Stephanie who put in the work day in and day out that make our communities\u2026 I voted today for the Laken Riley Act, which holds the Biden Administration accountable for its dangerous open borders policies and protects Americans by requiring ICE to issue a detainer for illegal immigrants who are charged or cited with local theft or burglary. When you hear or read about Palestinian casualty numbers from the \u201cGaza Ministry of Health\u201d cited by the Biden Administration and others, you should be very cautious. Part of Hamas\u2019 war strategy is to use propaganda, tap into antisemitism, and wage a global PR campaign against\u2026 The strength of NATO is rooted in the alliance of its members. The addition of Sweden to NATO makes the security of all member-nations even stronger. By working collaboratively with officials at all levels of government we can solve our region\u2019s challenges. The significant funding I secured for the Coachella Valley in the appropriations bill yesterday is a big step forward. I met with members of the California Fraternal Order of Police today in DC to discuss how we support our law enforcement officers and keep California safe. I voted today for bipartisan legislation that includes more than million for District projects that I requested and successfully advocated for to address our transportation, homeless, and water infrastructure needs. Find more information on the projects here:\u2026 I just voted along with a bipartisan majority of the House to approve the first appropriations package. The bill is far from perfect, which is often the case when a compromise is struck. Despite only narrowly controlling one half of one third of the government, House Republicans\u2026 It might be election day back in California but here in the House of Representatives I just voted to pass the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act Kids First which funds research on rare childhood cancers, birth defects, and other rare pediatric diseases. Remember how we got here: Hamas murdered, raped and kidnapped innocent Israelis, and currently have over hostages, including Americans. They refuse to provide a list of living hostages and continue to fire rockets into Israel. Israel has every right to\u2026 The atrocities committed by Hamas against women are pure evil. There can be no peace until all of the hostages are released and those responsible for these barbaric acts can never repeat them ever again. President Biden and VP Harris are not serious about securing our border. The evidence is overwhelming and obvious. Once again, America\u2019s system of checks and balances has worked. The Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous ruling this morning ensures that radical Democrats cannot exclude their political opponents from the ballot. Today\u2019s ruling is a victory for our democracy. President Biden's border crisis is a threat to our national security. Today, I joined a bipartisan majority of the House to ensure our government keeps running. Next week, the House is expected to consider a bipartisan package of six of our annual spending bills. Not only did the Defense Secretary carelessly misstate what figure he was referring to, he was using statistics our military cannot independently verify and figures that don't delineate between civilians and militants. His mistakes will now fuel propaganda from Hamas and its\u2026 As President Biden heads to the border for a photo op, remember that on his very first day in office he launched his open borders agenda: Biden terminated the National Emergency at the Southwest border (Proclamation thereby halting emergency construction of a border\u2026 Earlier today I spoke with California water leaders who are in town for the annual #ACWAConf I am proud of our collaborative bipartisan work to ensure Californians have access to an affordable and reliable supply of water. Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s impact on the Senate and our country will be felt long after he steps aside from his leadership post. Few have done more than Leader McConnell to advance conservative policy priorities, reshape the judiciary, and champion America\u2019s leadership on the world\u2026 Today's Gallup poll reflects the rising concern Americans have about President Biden's border crisis. They don't want to see a photo-op of the President at the border - they want the border secured. It\u2019s our Congressional duty to keep the government running \u2013 period. I do NOT support a shutdown. I will continue working on reaching a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that keeps our government open and fight for the priorities I have supported throughout this process. The Biden administration has taken more than unilateral executive actions to open our borders and create the crisis we see today. President Biden's claims that he's powerless to do anything to fix the problem he created are pure fiction. It was great to join together with Defense Department leaders, like , a bipartisan group of House members, and industry innovators at this inaugural event in the Coachella Valley. Thanks to all who participated and are working to disrupt the status quo. I joined this bipartisan effort along with and to advocate for long-term solutions to this environmental challenge confronting southern California. According to a recent survey, one in eight retirees plan to return to work in due to rising prices that have been fueled by President Biden's runaway spending. That's why I have voted to put a stop to the inflationary spending that's made it harder for Americans to get by. IVF is a miracle that has opened the door to parenthood for many where it would have otherwise not been possible. My position is clear: Strong families are critical to our country\u2019s future and I believe we should be doing more to help mothers who want to start a family not less. The combination of Pres. Biden's open border policies and sanctuary state policies backed by liberal governors, like Gavin Newsom, have jeopardized the safety of Americans. We must act to reverse these policies before more tragedies, like the death of Laken Riley, happen again. President Biden\u2019s open border policies continue to threaten the safety of all Americans. People from all corners of the world are illegally entering our country every single day. Biden can take steps to secure the border today but he chooses not to. This week I made my annual tour around the Congressional District. My staff and I spoke with city leaders in both the Coachella Valley and western Riverside County about what is happening in their communities. And, most importantly, we discussed how we can partner together\u2026 Here is my statement in response to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments: Since the moment President Biden took executive actions that created our border crisis, it\u2019s been clear that he can take executive actions that would help address the problem. He\u2019s chosen not to as millions of people and deadly drugs pour across. The border crisis is out of control. President Biden can take action now to stem the flow, but has chosen not to. We must reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy now and stop the abuse of our asylum process that is being exploited by people from around the world. I've spoken with many of the Gold Star Families who lost a loved one at the Abbey Gate bombing including those I represent - not only do they strongly disagree, their lives are forever changed because of those incredibly painful mistakes. Alexei Navalny was a fearless advocate for the Russian people who ultimately spent his final days in prison because of Putin\u2019s desperation and fear of losing power. Dictators like Putin can imprison and eliminate their critics, but they can never extinguish the ideas and spirit\u2026 Today, I voted along with a bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives to pass H.R. a bill I cosponsored to support the human rights of Uyghurs and members of other minority groups residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. I appreciate , and all of my colleagues who participated in this important briefing. Keeping Californians safe from natural disasters will always be a bipartisan priority for our delegation. I just voted to pass H.R. the Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential Act of which will strengthen America's economy and national security by reversing President Biden's misguided decision to pause pending natural gas export terminals. It simply doesn't make sense to\u2026 I voted against President Biden's so-called \"Inflation Reduction Act\" in because it was clear then that spending billions of tax dollars was only going to further fuel rising prices. Americans are now stuck with more debt and more inflation. It was great to meet with Chairman Reid Milanovich of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians yesterday. I appreciate everything the tribe does to support the Coachella Valley and look forward to our work together to make the valley a better place to live, work & do business. I just voted along with a bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives to pass H. RES. a resolution I co-sponsored to condemn rape and sexual violence committed by Hamas in its war against Israel. Here is my statement on the vote to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas: Thanks to the resolve and leadership of , this bill was passed and signed into law. It put a stop to Democrats' inflationary spending and is saving taxpayers billions. Prices continue to rise. Wages are not keeping up. That means American workers are falling further behind. #Bidenomics Two more hostages have been rescued from Hamas terrorists thanks to the brave actions of IDF soldiers. America stands with Israel in its efforts to bring home all of the hostages. Last night I had the pleasure of attending the annual fundraising gala for the Palm Springs Air Museum. The museum does a wonderful job shining a light on our civilian and military aviation history for people of all ages. Thanks to all who support this jewel of the Coachella\u2026 Just days after President Biden led a majority of House Democrats to oppose my clean Israel supplemental bill that also provided funding for U.S. troops, the President said last night that Israel\u2019s response to the October attack has been \u201cover the top.\u201d Hamas terrorists\u2026 I believe all Americans should be concerned by the DOJ\u2019s special counsel finding that President Biden \u201cwillfully retained and disclosed classified materials\u2026when he was a private citizen.\u201d Furthermore, to support his conclusion that jurors would be unlikely to convict Biden due\u2026 I'm excited to announce my office's nominations for the U.S. Service Academies from the Congressional District. These students are extraordinary representatives of our region. Read the full list of nominees here: My prayers go out to the family and friends of the five Marines who were killed in this tragic incident. Biden's ban on LNG exports is bad for jobs, bad for our national security and, yes, bad for our environment. According to DOE, U.S. LNG exports are cleaner than Russian natural gas delivered to Europe. Despite these ongoing attacks, a majority of House Democrats just voted against billion in emergency funding for U.S. troops in harm's way. I am hopeful the House will once again consider this critical aid in the very near future. A majority of the Democrat Caucus dealt us a setback today in our attempt to support Israel and our U.S. military in the region. The Israelis are in the midst of a struggle for their survival and a fight to secure peace by rooting out those responsible for the October Here are the remarks I just made on the House floor regarding the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act. Our Congress is divided on many issues but when we have broad, bipartisan agreement \u2013 like we do on supporting Israel and our own military \u2013 let\u2019s get that work done and move on to the more difficult task of resolving our differences on other important issues. I thank my\u2026 The Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act not only provides aid to Israel, it also provides billion for ongoing U.S. military operations in the region. A vote against the bill is a vote to deny our men and women in uniform the resources they need. The best way send a strong message to Israel and our American troops in the region is to pass the bill with a strong bipartisan vote and give them the resources they need. President Biden said today \u201cwe can\u2019t continue our petty partisan politics\u201d just after he suggested Republicans care more about Putin than America. It\u2019s no surprise his weak, ineffective, and divisive leadership is losing more and more support from Americans every day. This is a bold-faced lie. President Biden has taken action after action to weaken our border security. Here are just the steps he took on his first day in office: Jan President Biden terminated the National Emergency at the Southwest border (Proclamation This is a clean bill that includes the Israel funding requested by the President. The only thing we\u2019ve added is U.S. military funding to pay for our increased operations in the region. For Democrats to call this a political ploy is nothing more than theater. It\u2019s increasingly\u2026 I believe there is broad, bipartisan support for standing with Israel and supporting them in their campaign to protect its civilians from those responsible for the October attack. I am disappointed by the President\u2019s veto statement but I am hopeful that, for the sake of the\u2026 District constituent and Winchester resident William contacted my office for assistance when his mother-in-law was having difficulty obtaining an appointment at a U.S. embassy overseas. My staff was able to arrange an appointment and help William and his family reunite. If\u2026 My bill, the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, ensures Israel has the tools it needs to protect its people and eliminate the threat posed by those responsible for the October attack. It also sends a strong message that the U.S. unequivocally stands with Israel. American LNG exports create jobs, help our economy and provide a critical lifeline for our European allies to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. I joined together with my colleagues to urge the Biden administration to reverse this misguided decision. America has a national security interest in securing our border, supporting our ally Israel, and partnering in the international effort to stop Putin\u2019s aggression. Today, there\u2019s only a clear, broad, bipartisan, bicameral agreement on Israel and funding our U.S. military\u2026 We can\u2019t keep dumping billions of tax dollars into the same homeless programs and hope for different results. Read my op-ed about the bill I introduced this week to get those living on the streets with mental health or drug abuse challenges the treatment they need. Here is my statement on the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, a bill providing billion in military assistance for Israel as well as important funding for U.S. Forces in the region, that I have crafted along with Chairwoman as well as State and\u2026 Today\u2019s strikes against Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force and affiliated militia groups are a justified response for the Iranian-backed attack that resulted in the deaths of three U.S. service members and injuries to dozens more. It\u2019s in our national security\u2026 With the cost of living and doing business higher than ever, families and small businesses are desperate for relief. I voted for the bipartisan Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act to do exactly that. Most immigrants come to America for looking for a better life. Those who enter our country illegally and then commit additional crimes should not remain in our country. This week I voted along with a majority of the House to pass news laws that pave the way for the removal of\u2026 After spending billions of taxpayer dollars on federal homeless programs, it\u2019s clear our current approach is simply not working. Huge percentages of our homeless population are falling through the cracks of our homeless programs because they are not getting the\u2026 I want to thank , , and for cosponsoring H.R. and working with me to find solutions to our homeless crisis. It is no surprise that the cartels facilitating illegal border crossings shift their patterns to find the path of least resistance. That's why we need better border security across the entire southern border. I just voted for the bipartisan Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act, which includes pro-growth tax policies that will help families and small businesses. Always happy to work together with and our local water agencies to ensure Californians have access to affordable and reliable sources of water. I just voted to pass the Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act, to impose new federal offenses on illegal immigrants and smugglers who engage in high-speed car chases with Border Patrol agents or local law enforcement assisting them. I will always stand up for those who put\u2026 I appreciate being mentioned by Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks in her speech today at the American Dynamism Summit about my efforts to champion innovation as Chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We must change the status quo at the Pentagon to better\u2026 Just moments after President Biden said \"I\u2019ve done all I can do\" with respect to the border crisis, his own press secretary admitted \"that certainly he [Biden] feels that there are things that are within his power.\" The President should take action now to secure the border. Praying for the families of our fallen heroes: Sgt. William Rivers Spc. Kennedy Sanders Spc. Breonna Moffett Their service to our nation will never be forgotten. I was proud to work with the and local leaders to successfully advocate for a million grant from the Trump administration in that is making this project possible. When completed, it will help ease traffic for southwest Riverside County drivers. The Biden administration has taken executive actions on at least occasions that have made our border crisis worse. They took these steps without Congressional action - which means they can undue them today if they wanted and move to secure our border. U.S. troops in Syria & Iraq have been attacked more than times since Oct. by Iran-backed terror groups. The deadly consequences of the attack in Jordan makes it clear that the Biden response to those attacks failed to deter Iran and these terror groups. Here is my statement on the attacks in Jordan by Iranian-backed terrorists that killed three U.S. service members and injured On we join together with Ruth and people across the world to remember the million Jewish victims and pledge to stand against antisemitism and hate wherever it exists. As we close out National School Choice Week, I pledge to always empower parents because no one knows what\u2019s in the best interest of their child more than their parents. Biden\u2019s border crisis is out of control. As Republicans have said for far too long, the president must take action to end this national security and humanitarian disaster. We must secure our border. Defense startups and small businesses are where innovation happens and should play a bigger role in our national security. We need to change the culture at DoD and widen the defense industrial base, which will result in cheaper and more agile systems. To spur this type of overdue disruption at the Pentagon, my defense appropriations bill has a investment in the Defense Innovation Unit and for APFIT - a program I created to more quickly get new technologies into the hands of our warfighters. Coachella Valley resident, Rebecca, reached out to my office for help obtaining the military medals of her deceased father - Col. John L. Holladay. My office was happy to secure replacement medals and help honor her father\u2019s service to our nation. \u201cThis historic achievement would not be possible without the steadfast efforts of a bipartisan group of congressional members including Sen. Alex Padilla, D-California, Sen. John Boozman, R-Arkansas, and Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Corona, who carried the torch and finished the race.\u201d I support school choice because I believe we should empower parents to make the best decisions about the future of their children. The loss of these heroes is heartbreaking. Our nation is forever grateful for their service. Please keep their families in your prayers. I joined my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to demand answers from the NIH about federal taxpayer dollars going to studies that subject dogs and cats to unnecessary tests. We need to protect animals and taxpayers by promoting the use of alternative methods of testing. This week I joined some of my California delegation colleagues in hosting a bipartisan virtual briefing with the Army Corps of Engineers on the resources available to communities as we encounter an El Ni\u00f1o winter season that could result in flooding in the state. I participated in the America's Future Series () National Security Summit yesterday and discussed the national security benefits of taking risks as we innovate and leverage America's technological advantage over our adversaries. Kfir Bibas was just months old when he was kidnapped from his home by Hamas terrorists. Today, he will turn one while being held hostage by Hamas. Kfir Bibas, and every Israeli held captive, must be released. LA Times: \"Even in CA, a Democratic stronghold, registered voters by to say U.S. borders are not secure in preventing people from entering the country illegally.\" Pres. Biden should listen to the American people and take action on the border now. I am thankful for the strong bipartisan vote in the Senate rejecting this resolution. The United States continues to stand with Israel and its efforts to secure a lasting peace for its citizens and the region. The Biden Admin should re-list the Houthi rebels in Yemen as a global terrorist group now \u2013 not in days with \u201cunprecedented carve outs.\" Since Biden\u2019s misguided decision to de-list them, Houthis have recklessly attacked international cargo ships and targeted US forces. A record number of individuals on our terror watchlist illegally tried to cross our border last year. A record number of individuals illegally crossed without being caught and processed by our border patrol. These trends are a threat to our national security and must be stopped. Today we honor and remember Martin Luther King Jr. , one of our country\u2019s great champions of justice and freedom. Let us find inspiration by his words and deeds as we work collectively to advance the cause of our American experiment. Even the liberal Washington Post is calling out the White House for lying about House Republicans voting to \"cut Border Patrol agents.\" The truth? \"They have voted to increase the total by nearly Seniors looking for help from the Social Security Administration shouldn't be left on hold endlessly hoping someone picks up. I introduced the Stuck on Hold Act to make sure callers get call wait time estimates and, if wait times are long, they are offered a call back. Since Joe Biden took office inflation has risen by due to reckless levels of inflationary spending passed by Democrats in DC. House Republicans are fighting to put a stop to the runaway spending that is hurting American families. My office was informed that the aircrafts have successfully been transferred to the state, where they will now be retrofitted to combat wildfires. The first planes are expected to be ready to protect lives and homes this summer. This is despicable. You have a right to express your opinion. You don't have a right to dishonor the Americans who fought and died to protect your right to expression. On Law Enforcement Appreciation Day and every day, I\u2019m thankful for the men and women who serve and protect us. I was truly humbled and honored to be recognized at last night\u2019s Chabad Classic in the Coachella Valley. The wonderful event supports Jewish youth programs in the valley. Every hostage still held by Hamas in Gaza must be released. We cannot forget or ignore the evil atrocities committed by Hamas. There was a ceasefire on October It was Hamas who broke it. By working together in a bipartisan fashion we can achieve great things for California and our constituents. Click the link below to read my joint op-ed with about our efforts to improve California\u2019s ability to fight wildfires. Merry Christmas! I recently recorded a holiday greeting to be shown on American Forces Network to our troops around the world. As you enjoy this holiday, please take a moment to give thanks to the families that are separated because someone is serving our country overseas. The folks at NORAD are busy today tracking Santa. Click the link below to keep up with his progress as he makes his way to California later tonight. Regardless of the ups and downs of what\u2019s happening in Congress, my staff and I work every day to serve the constituents of the Congressional District. Happy Birthday Guardians! The high taxes, soft-on-crime laws, and housing policies enacted by radical Democrats in California are driving more and more people out of our state. We have to reverse course on these misguided policies. It's been months since the House of Representatives passed HR in response to our crisis at the border. Since then, Democrats in the Senate and Pres. Biden have done nothing as the crisis worsens every day. This is a humanitarian, national security, and economic disaster. As this article mentions my bipartisan bill - The Stuck on Hold Act - would help get Americans the assistance they need over the phone without waiting forever on hold. This is difficult to watch, but we cannot ignore or forget the savage acts committed by Hamas terrorists on October These evil actions are why Israel is acting to ensure they never happen again and why America must stand beside them. Your tax dollars were used by to subject mice to gun smoke in a study. As a long-time animal welfare advocate I believe should stop funding wasteful animal tests & rolling back common-sense reforms that help animals, taxpayers & the environment. The defense bill passed by the House today includes a provision I requested that will transfer seven aircraft from the Coast Guard to CA for use in wildfire suppression. This was a bipartisan effort I worked with on to help protect Californians. Like so many Americans, I was shocked by the failure of Harvard, Penn and MIT leaders to clearly state that calls for the genocide of Jews constitute harassment. Today, I voted for a bipartisan resolution condemning their testimony and antisemitism on our college campuses. Here is my statement on the vote authorizing the Biden impeachment inquiry: The Biden border crisis won't end unless our policies change. That's why I voted along with my House colleagues earlier this year to reform our asylum process. Democrats who control the Senate and the White House must act. I signed a letter w/ my colleagues calling on VA Secretary Denis McDonough to hold VA attorney Shekeba Morrad accountable for the video she posted mocking Israelis who are asking for the return of hostages taken by Hamas terrorists. Antisemitism cannot be accepted at the VA. Mexican authorities just detained two Iranians near the border who were under observation by the FBI. We know all too well how much death and destruction just a few bad actors can cause. Border security is national security. It's now been more than two months since the October attacks. Israeli civilians continue to be held captive by Hamas terrorists. Every single hostage must be released. Period. The border crisis is only getting worse under Biden's failed leadership. No one blames people for wanting to come to America. We need a functional legal process for that to occur. Our asylum laws are being abused. The House passed HR it's time for the Senate and WH to act. When taxpayers call fed agencies like the VA or Social Security they shouldn't be left on hold for endless amounts of time praying someone picks up. I introduced the Stuck on Hold Act to end their frustration by requiring estimated wait times & an option to receive a call back. Happy Hanukkah to all who celebrate! I hope you have a joyous time surrounded by family and friends over the next eight nights. Today, we honor and remember the service members and civilians who were killed during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December We also reflect on the countless ways Americans stood together in defense of our nation in the wake of those events. Did you know the average call wait time at Social Security is minutes? Even worse, callers are not given an estimated wait time. As I explained in this interview with , I am introducing the Stuck on Hold Act today to ease the frustration of calling a federal agency. Thank you for your leadership and stepping up for our Jewish community. Again, It's alarming that a university like is lead by individuals whose response to calls for the genocide of Jews leaves people confused and requires clarifying. Students at all campuses deserve clear words and forceful actions protecting them from hate and violence. Thank you for coming by to talk about how we can better protect our communities. I will continue to stand with local law enforcement as they bravely do everything in their power to keep Californians safe. It's alarming that a university like is lead by individuals whose response to calls for the genocide of Jews leaves people confused and requires clarifying. Students at all campuses deserve clear words and forceful actions protecting them from hate and violence. My statement on Today, invited students from Harvard, MIT and Penn to share their experiences and shine a light on the antisemitism taking place at their schools. All college administrators must do more to protect Jewish students and keep antisemitism off our campuses. It\u2019s heartbreaking to learn of the deaths of Major Luke Unrath of Riverside and seven other American troops in a tragic aircraft accident off the coast of Japan. My prayers are with the families of these proud heroes who served their nation. Attacks on the U.S. military by Iranian-backed proxies continue to threaten the lives of American troops. The steps ordered by President Biden in response to the attacks have so far failed to deter this aggression. We must send a clear and convincing message. This weekend I participated in a panel discussion alongside military and industry leaders about innovation and the future of our military at the annual Reagan National Defense Forum here in California. #RNDF There's no room for antisemitism on our college campuses. All students of all faiths should be safe and welcome to learn. Tomorrow, the will hold a hearing on the disturbing scenes we've seen play out at colleges since October Thrilled to once again participate and attend the Reagan National Defense Forum along with military and national security leaders. #RNDF As the first woman to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was a trailblazer whose legacy and impact will continue long after her passing. My thoughts are with her family. U.S. citizens trying to reach the U.S. Embassy in Israel can fill out this form or call or For the latest updates, please monitor the messages to U.S. citizens from the U.S. Embassy in Israel:", "The same radical leftists who call MAGA Republicans a 'threat to democracy' refuse to condemn anti-Israel protesters who chant \"Death to America.\" Reminder: Joe Biden could secure the southern border *today* by enforcing our laws and reinstating common sense Trump-era border policies. Here are things he can do: The Constitution requires the Senate to conduct a trial for those impeached by the House of For the first time in over years, seems ready to abandon this responsibility. Americans are demanding accountability. NEW: Mullin Promotes \u2019s Role in Future of Air Mobility Looking forward to joining #CPACHungary in just a few weeks to weigh in on border security and illegal immigration and discuss our shared conservative values.

It was a privilege to have one of Altus\u2019 own, Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost in front of the today to lend her expertise on\u2026 Pro-Hamas \"Free Palestine\" activists have never once called for a Hamas ceasefire. Why? Because they know as well as anyone that if #Hamas lays down their weapons, this war would end. If #Israel stops defending themselves from terrorism, the state of Israel would cease to exist. Remember when the admin said inflation was transitory? Overall prices are still up since Biden entered office. Oklahomans are paying nearly double at the grocery store. Rent, transportation, and energy costs are still way too high. Americans can't afford the Biden economy. Great news for Oklahoma. ! Schumer doesn\u2019t want the American people to hear the case against Secretary Mayorkas. Never in American history has a Senate Majority Leader tabled articles of impeachment to prevent a trial. Can you imagine the media outrage if had tried to table Trump's first impeachment? We have a constitutional obligation, and seems poised to ignore it. NEW: I just dropped a bipartisan bill with support from and to strengthen rural community access to speciality care providers via telehealth services. Read about our legislation here: When the House of Representatives delivers articles of impeachment to the Senate, it is our constitutional obligation to serve as jurors and conduct a trial. The Senate must have the opportunity to evaluate the facts and deliver accountability for the American people.

I recently spoke with about the common challenges facing job creators in the community.

Proud to support 's new commonsense resolution expressing support for Israel taking necessary action to eliminate Hamas. It also affirms that 's ridiculous call for new leadership in Israel should be labeled for what it is: election interference. God bless our brave law enforcement officers who are on the frontlines of Biden's open border chaos. When will enough be enough? It doesn't take an act of Congress for the President of the United States to enforce the law on our border. Joe Biden loves to pick winners and losers in our economy by punishing entrepreneurs and job creators with crippling regulation. Americans who value the free market should be outraged by Biden's costly and reckless EV mandate agenda. Today, Joe Biden's radical EPA finalized a new rule in their effort to ban gas-powered cars and force a national EV mandate. I introduced the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act to reject this nonsense and protect consumer choice and free market competition. Good to see the Supreme Court affirm that if the Biden administration won't protect our southern border, the state of Texas has every right to do so. Last year, President Trump returned to Tulsa to cheer on the athletes competing in the Championship. Unforgettable! Despite nosediving approval numbers, Joe Biden still refuses to exercise his own executive authority to secure the southern border. Americans who care about border security should be asking: why has Biden neglected to act? Agriculture is who we are in Oklahoma. Our state proudly produces more than billion worth of livestock and crops each year. This we thank our Oklahoma farmers and ranchers for their efforts to feed, fuel, and clothe our communities. Even at the age of General Stafford was extremely passionate about the future of space exploration. I was honored to visit with him just last year. May General Stafford's memory be a blessing to all who loved and admired him. The Jewish state of Israel is a sovereign, democratic nation. Republicans must condemn Leader Chuck Schumer's call for the removal of Israel's leader. Liberal activists will not undercut our support for Israel. Very sad to hear that renowned General Tom Stafford (USAF, ret.) has passed away. A Weatherford native, Stafford graduated from Weatherford High School and went on to attend the U.S. Naval Academy. He became a pilot, flight leader, and flight test maintenance officer before being\u2026 The media truly outdid themselves this weekend with their pathetic attempts to spin President Trump's timely and correct warnings about Joe Biden's destructive Green New Deal agenda into yet another media hoax. This week, the House passed a bill to end the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s growing influence on . Let\u2019s talk about it. #WeeklyWrapUp The Chinese Communist Party uses as a propaganda machine to steal user data and undermine America. While this bill is a step in the right direction, more needs to be done to end the #CCP's malign influence on our nation's youth. Without reliable, affordable energy, you cannot have a reliable, affordable economy. Energy costs have spiked since Biden took office, and we are no longer energy independent. We must get America back on track. Joining the great on at ET. We've got a lot to cover. Listen live here: It's about time. Inflation is a compound factor. That means even if the inflation rate went to zero today, American families would still be stuck with Joe Biden's record-high inflationary costs. To the Pro-Hamas Caucus: there is zero moral equivalence between the Iran-backed Hamas terrorists who started this war and the innocent Jewish people. is our closest ally in the Middle East, and America will always stand with them. Under Joe Biden, electricity bills have skyrocketed That means if your home electric bill used to average it's now costing you nearly for the same usage. And Joe Biden wonders why more Americans aren't thanking him for a \"winning\" economy. When Joe Biden took office, inflation was at In the past years, inflation has compounded nearly and groceries are up That means a grocery bill that previously cost will now cost you MORE for the exact same goods. That's \"Bidenomics.\" Today, Joe Biden bent the knee to his most radical supporters and apologized to the evil illegal alien who brutally murdered Laken Riley. Instead of condemning this cowardice, the mainstream media is panicking over exposing the tragic reality of Biden\u2019s national\u2026 It\u2019s clear after last night, Joe Biden thinks the American people are stupid. If you haven\u2019t gotten a pay increase since Joe Biden took office, you\u2019ve effectively received a pay cut thanks to so-called \u2018Bidenomics.\u2019 Here\u2019s the truth: Joe Biden\u2019s angry, hyper partisan speech was packed with falsehoods and completely out of touch with the American people. He neglected to take any accountability for the many crises he has created. The American people deserve better. Republicans support nationwide access to fertility services, including IVF which has helped countless families fulfill the dream of starting a family. \u201cOur communities are NOT SAFER. For years, the Left has coddled offenders and defunded the police.\u201d Yep. is giving the real State of the Union. #BackTheBlue Glad that\u2019s over, now we can look forward to our positive, focused, and optimistic Republican Response. This shouting, slurred, partisan rant is almost over. Glad this is his last State of the Union. \u201cWhen you get to be my age, some things become kerr than ever.\u201d Well said. The Chinese Communist Party is the single greatest foreign threat to the United States. Biden\u2019s appeasement strategy makes America weak. Israel did not start this war. A ceasefire only allows Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists time to prepare. Biden is waving the finger at our closest ally in the Middle East while Kamala Harris cheers behind him. More pandering to the pro-Hamas caucus. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. We\u2019re hearing about climate hysteria and environmental \u2018justice\u2019, and nothing about unleashing American energy dominance, or a plan to lower energy costs which remain higher under Joe Biden. \u201cLincoln Riley.\u201d America\u2019s victims of the Biden border catastrophe deserve so much better. Here it is. minutes in, Biden jumps on Republicans for his border catastrophe. FACT: Biden created this crisis himself when he dismantled President Trump\u2019s border security with executive actions in his first days. Joe Biden owns this crisis, and he has EVERY authority\u2026 Shrinkflation. Is he serious? Will Joe Biden attempt to appease the pro-Hamas wing of the party before mentioning America\u2019s issue\u2014 the southern border? Joe Biden is trying to pass the buck on record high inflation by attacking hard-working business owners. \u201cI\u2019m a capitalist,\u201d he says. Give me a break. Joe \u2014 SCOTUS already ruled that your illegal student debt transfer is Nice try. Did Joe Biden really just mention mortgage rates and unaffordable living? Take a look in the mirror. FACT: Americans say current housing prices are putting homeownership out of reach. Let\u2019s make one thing clear. Socialist price control schemes stifle American innovation and limit life-saving cures. While Joe Biden is slurring hyper partisan one-liners, there\u2019s still no mention of the devastating catastrophe on our southern border. The American people aren't buying what Joe Biden is selling tonight. The average family is being forced to spend an extra per month due to high costs, the southern border is wide open, and this administration regularly chooses appeasement over strength. . is all of us tonight.

After attending a bipartisan briefing on Iraq and Iran this afternoon, I released the following statement: The government of Iran is the number one sponsor of terrorism worldwide, and we must proceed cautiously while remaining resolute in protecting our country and in defending freedom. Soleimani ran Iran's terrorist Quds Force for over a decade and has orchestrated countless terror attacks, including the attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week.

When it becomes law, it'll be the most comprehensive public lands bill to pass Congress in over a decade. Earlier today, the Senate passed a critical public lands bill that includes three pieces of my legislation. When it becomes law, this will be the most comprehensive public lands legislation to pass Congress in over a decade. Just finished watching President Trump\u2019s #SOTU. Here are my thoughts: Whether deriding racial minorities at home or cavorting with Nazis and white supremacists abroad, Rep. Steve King brings dishonor to himself, the party of Abraham Lincoln, and his nation. We must reconsider whether Mr. King has the moral authority to continue serving in Congress. America has lost a true statesman. President Bush spent his entire life in service to our nation. He was a naval aviator, a Congressman, Ambassador, CIA Chief, Vice President, and President. We will never forget his steadfast leadership and unwavering commitment to our nation. Wishing you all a safe and Happy Thanksgiving! It was an honor to participate in the U.S. Marine Corps Birthday Cake Cutting Ceremony this morning. Semper Fi! Yesterday's horrific terror attack in Pennsylvania, shows why it's critical that we fight hatred wherever we see it. All Americans should be concerned about any rise in Anti-Semitism. America stands with the victims and their families during this tragic time. Never forget. I\u2019m saddened to learn of the passing of Senator John McCain. He was a true American Hero who dedicated his life to serving our country. My deepest condolences to Cindy McCain and his entire family. An edit to a website won't change the fact that #Taiwan exists and is an important US ally. We must continue to stand up to China and their bullying tactics.

Today, I and @repsires and intro'd condemning crisis, applauding actions by and global partners, and urging more action for Venezuelan people! Today, my bill, HR passed unanimously in the House. The bill protects recreational and OHV areas, makes crucial expansions to our national park lands, and represents a consensus on how to manage our public lands in the California desert. Congrats to constituent Leslie Arroyo on her selection to join the Women in Science Camp in Tbilisi, Georgia. I met with Leslie last year to discuss #STEAM opportunities for young girls and now she will be engaging with girls from around the world! Terrible news as Chinese checkbook diplomacy steals away Burkina Faso from our ally, Taiwan. Congress is united in its support for the people of Taiwan against these bullies in Beijing. I issued the following statement on the #IranDeal Last week I led a bipartisan delegation to . The successful visit underscores our commitment to stronger engagement with the Western Hemisphere.

The CR provided health care for over million children and crucial funding for our military and national defense. Here's my full statement: More action is needed to address Hezbollah's drug trafficking activities. Met today with U.S. State Department\u2019s Under Secretary for Political Affairs, Thomas Shannon to discuss U.S. policy priorities in the Western Hemisphere.

Watch my latest zippo brief including my first impressions of the proposed tax reform bill that was released today. My thoughts and prayers go out to those affected by the devastating #santarosafire. Thank you to the brave first responders who are helping! Deeply saddened by the events unfolding in Las Vegas. There's no excuse for this tragic loss of life. View my opinion about the #IranDeal. Its time to be get tough with Iran, nuclear and missile development will not be tolerated. We will never forget. #NeverForget .

Breaking News -- Congress just Passed H.R. - emergency relief funding for #TexasStrong My fellow Representatives and I are monitoring . We must work together to help our fellow Americans deal with this crisis My thoughts are with the victims of the horrible devastation in #Houston. I expect Congress to work on a relief package in the coming weeks. Here is what I am doing to combat the threat of #NorthKorea:", "Today I am disaffiliating from the Republican Party. See my letter below: You need to keep a sense of humor about some things. How dare you find no evidence of systemic fraud in the election? How dare you not support \u201cthe steal\u201d? Republican Party is behaving the Jonestown cult! Michigan GOP panel to consider resolution against election report author via A good guy and a great member of Congress. The Jan Special Committee begins work today. It should be a independent bipartisan commission like commission but R\u2019s scuttled that. That day will be etched into my memory. Our symbol of representative democracy was being overrun by thugs trying to overturn election. . and all friends. I go on offense today against renal cancer and am sitting in my first immunotherapy session. Game on. . I was first surprised you would say this then dismayed. You joining the Trump crowd - why? Espousing the Stop the Steal does not reflect the man in joined Congress. Any doubts the The Big Lie continues. These folks are here every Saturday. US DOJ announced today that continuing to push the Big Lie and he and his acolytes claiming Trump will be reinstated without any election. They note this rhetoric could lead to violent incidents in August. Which world county are we becoming? I believe I am sharing your experience Jim. Hang tough and hold your family close. God bless you I will continue my occasional political and policy posts. But most of my time and energy is fighting cancer as I have many friends that rely on this updates. Returned to the hospital a couple of days and off to ICU. Some post surgical issues arose but getting out and home soon Worth reading. State Senator McBroom investigates extensively and then stands on his principles. Proud of him. The Michigan Republican Who Decided to Tell the Truth - The Atlantic First Sunday home since my enduro stay at the hospital. Having coffee on porch with dogs at our sides and watching sheep graze. The work to recover continues and the fight with cancer - but getting stronger every day. I have posted about my oldest son being a LEO in a Detroit suburb. He served almost years but I watched the stress and anxiety build over the last year particularly. We discussed it very often given our respective roles. Well - that chapter has closed as he resigned to pursue his interests, have more time with his family and, to be honest, his mental health. He has faced numerous assaults and threats and decided he wanted to eliminate those risks in the current environment. Now - ask yourself how many communities are suffering similar loss of LEO\u2019s across America. We must resolve the roles and expectation of LEO soon folks. Believe that. I believe a boxing match for Charity between pretty boy and General Milley is the best answer. I am \u201cin\u201d for on Milley kicking Gaetz\u2019s ass. I have been shamed by one my friends and former colleagues - make if Come on stop yapping and step up. I see nothing has changed after my days in the hospital. I can no longer be angry but rather truly saddened by @GOPLeader \u201cleadership\u201d. Good God. Happy Father\u2019s Day all! Not exactly how or where I anticipated celebrating today but moving forward still and saw or chatted with all my children today. Nice. I received so many vm and texts with prayers and well wishes it was wonderful and much appreciated. I will try to work through all of them and drop notes back over the next little while. Recovery and rehab is absorbing so much of my time and energy. But thank you all. I haven\u2019t posted in over weeks as most of you know of the health challenges I and my family face. But - good news - my progress is going well and I just was transferred to in-patient rehab! Step before going home. Thanks to all for the prayers and well wishes. Sad that \u201cleadership\u201d in GOP House and Senate will undermine a negotiated bi-partisan deal - but not surprising. I agree. I believe only God gets to decide! I am proud that Michigan\u2019s Constitution prohibits the death penalty. Nothing like boy with his dog to make my heart just smile! I began receiving occasional threats shortly after my election in Yes - the number and ferocity increased after election. Since when did \u201cleaders\u201d become cowards. Just wow - these folks continue public \u201chealth\u201d orders that reflect a astonishing level of regulatory intrusion. Focus upon vaccines, testing and tracing especially in hot spots and stop trying to regulate details in our lives. I agree that Members believe Trump supporters impact them. But I believe far more in primaries than general elections. They are missing that distinction. This is also a proxy vote on McCarthy - and # say he can\u2019t win Speaker\u2019s gavel. . - you were quick to make a snotty comment earlier. I, and my guess others, are anxious to here the principles or science behind your decision to ignore water quality issues in your gravel legislation. Asked twice - and will wait to here this one. Oops - hear not here. Morning in Michigan! And what does say when faced with such guidance from the CDC? And our fed govt should make them, and any others that cyberattack our country, pay dearly for their actions. Time for proactive steps to address this challenge - including wipe them from the earth if necessary. I am proud to be one of the Americans that founded Renew America. ENOUGH of the destructive and vindictive politics that fails to address real challenges America faces. Join us and help Renew America! I am not sure what is more scary. The possibility actually believes what he said or his seat I. Congress is so important to him he would say these things. Either way - disgusting and dangerous. Aggregate groups continue their efforts to establish gravel mines in residential areas - because it less costly! This includes a mine in Metamora adjacent to an EPA Superfund site! New push begins to ease approval of gravel mines in residential areas I thought of all elected officials a State Senator FROM FLINT would understand and defend against that. The people behind this are the same folks that pushed a billion yearly tax increase. They want gravel wherever and your $$. So - what were you promised by the gravel industry and companies to ignore water contamination concerns? I simply can not watch this full video. It is disturbing and so disheartening. How can people that claimed to be \u201cpatriots\u201d do this to an LEO? My oldest son is an officer in Michigan and to think that there are people that hate LEO\u2019s is disturbing. God help us all. While DC and media is focused upon Cheney and Trump - our national economy is getting hammered. The Biden Admin and Congress needs to pay attention to this and the jobs report! CPI April Inflation speeds up in April as consumer prices leap I do not care that their motives were not intended to be destructive. The US govt must make an example of this group. Colonial Pipeline hackers try to shift blame for cyberattack I certainly hope you reach greater maturity before you attempt true leadership This tweet indicates you have need some work on leading on contentious times. Oh - I know this feeling. Standing in the wilderness trying to get people to recognize issues and actions required to move forward effectively - not pretend \u201cnothing happened\u201d or change is not needed. Faced this challenge in business several times. This is just more public! Not surprised. This was \u201cdone\u201d about days ago - But this issue is not going away! Are we going to focus upon respecting our Republic and policies that address needs of \u201caverage\u201d Americans - folks that go to work, pay taxes and just wish to live without govt interference? Yes - it is! ENOUGH! I do not know you or what you are suffering with but my heart aches for you and your son. My prayers for both of you. Yes - remaining silent and going along with the flock like a sheep is neither leadership or keeping the oath all Members of Congress take. I respect Liz for standing strongly and unequivocally for our Constitution. Damn - speaking on the floor and throwing down about Trump and being a Republican. She will not go down quietly. Yea - God bless #Israel Biden Administration must take a strong stance supporting Israel and demanding Hamas cease! Chatted with with about the purge of and the future of Republicans. I have not agreed with Liz on some issue or policies but I stand with her, firmly, on the principles for which she is being removed as Conf Chair. Yes - there is and will be a backlash. \u201cAllies\u201d realizing McCarthy will toss anyone under the bus if gains him political advantage. I don\u2019t believe he will have votes to become Speaker if R\u2019s take majority in The most accurate assessment of \u2066@GOPLeader\u2069 Meet Kevin McCarthy, political hollow man I agree with Incentives are important for individual decisions and send critical messages to our broader society. Work and careers must always be supported for all that are able to work. Job search requirement has been suspended for months and when reinstated later this month recipients need only demonstrate they applied for one job a week! Anyone wondering why a worker shortage is being experienced in many areas and industries? While I am years old and mom left the earth too many years ago - I still miss her. She could be a tough determined woman but I owe so much of what I am to her! I disagree with the headline - the monthly jobs report indicates we do have a labor shortage in US. This is a good article outlining some underlying causes. It neglects to include discussion of the impact of the enhanced UI on willingness to work - Everyone - read this article and let\u2019s find this missing year old woman. Sheriff seeks help in locating missing Casco Township woman An accurate description of \u2066@GOPLeader\u2069 style of \u201cleadership\u201d and his single minded pursuit of the gavel. Irony - R may gain majority after mid-term elections - and look beyond him Kevin McCarthy's GOP is Tired of Hearing the Truth - The Dispatch The world is watching as well as history. I had to leave the GOP in early December as I recognized \u201cStop the Steal\u201d was a direct threat to our democracy. Liz Cheney: The GOP is at a turning point. History is watching us. Yes - they will purge \u2066\u2069 from leadership for one reason - she will not acquiesce to the Big Lie. Her \u201creplacement\u201d voted with the party and Trump policies far less frequently but somehow is a better choice. Sad. Is should be clear to all that will not simply go away quietly...nor should she. Starting the day for all with a little lamb fluff. They are growing so quickly. Enjoy - I must go out and feed all in a few minutes. No one in America should forget or forgive January Ever! Anyone surprised? I bet the rates of LEO\u2019s departing are similar in a Portland. Would you wish to work law enforcement in either of those, or similar, communities? Very informative article full of data and maps. If you look at the one showing the shift in support for Trump from to - it tells an interesting story. Politicians should review this data - Elections: Change in votes for Donald Trumo And if he had an ounce of conviction to principles rather than political opportunism @GOPLeader would have told Trump to F\u2014- Off and retire as a loser. - his primary objective is achieving the \u201cgavel\u201d. Something Michigan\u2019s Governor should have considered in all her public health orders long ago. But then again - she appears to enjoy a more directive and controlling approach to leading and governing. And people continue to ask me why I left the party and/or whether I will rejoin the GOP Not until the party recognizes the terribly destructive nature of this philosophy and rhetoric. In Texas at an auto racing event at Circuit of The Americas (Austin). Efforts to vaccinate took a new turn. National Guard riding around on a golf cart offering COVID vaccine to participants and crew in paddock. Now there is outreach in TX. I agree and we must move quickly. America lacks the skilled workforce to support the infrastructure plans being proposed on either side of the aisle. I will disagree with you on this one. The evidence presented in the House did not warrant Trump\u2019s impeachment and I voted against accordingly. He may have done so - with associates. But clear proof is warranted. I would have voted to impeach after riot! So the Trump a**-kissing continues! What does it take for GOP to determine for the sake of our country it needs to return to core principles - small government with limited role, strong national defense and equality for all? Yes - leaders eat last. They also LEAD - not equivocate, pander or flip flop. Give it try @GOPLeader If you look closely I think there are seven lambs huddled for warmth tonight. Now there is some teamwork against a colder night! Bahaha - apparently the attorney believes the minute video will disappear? Or maybe refusing to provide license or ID after repeated request was allowable. Or resisting arrest and cuffing would go well for him? Pompous elected official received more leeway than most. Served terms with @GOPLeader including on the elected Leadership team. Kevin always tried to smooth things over with the segments of the GOP Conference. Problem here - you can\u2019t smooth this one over or appease Trump and followers and also defend our Republic. Shameful And that fact is why I felt it necessary to depart the GOP. The fact that \u201cLeadership\u201d in the House and within the national GOP espoused and supported the Big Lie I believed damages our country. Still do. And they did all that without any federal legislation or regulation. Nice turnaround in Newark and I believe we can see this more extensively in America with focus and persistence. Today\u2019s project was hoof care and moving part of our flock to summer pasture. It was a busy morning!white h Our Great Pyrenees and middle son chatting about the meaning of life by the fire on our patio. A good day! I have decided not to post on so many policy and political issues. Those topics consume so many Twitter users - and to be honest - with little substantive impact. Decided to routinely tweet more positive topics and images of life and America - we all need more of such things Offered with further comment or interpretation. Don\u2019t Create False Villains To Serve a Greater Good - The French Press A knife is a deadly weapon. It is being brandished as a imminent threat against several people despite presence of police. Not every officer involved shooting reflects excessive force folks and let\u2019s start accepting that as a reality. Sorry folks but enough. As most know I am not a fan but she does not \u201cowe\u201d us this information. I agree the hypocrisy demonstrates by the Gov and her aides should be highlighted but harassing her for family details is childish. Justice was served in Minn today. More is yet to be done. I worked closely with policing reform last session. But we could not get bi-partisan agreement. A bill has passed the House this term. I do not support some provisions but Senate must take this issue on I like Seems like a great guy. But I am not sure he knows what he is bargaining for and not sure he is prepared to deal with the range of issues. Defense attorney in #ChauvinTrial is basing his closing argument upon the \u201creasonable officer\u201d standard. WTH is reasonable about the duration for which his knee was pressing on his neck. My son is a LEO - and I am offended you would this reasonable. Seems there was a pretty extensively plan Logo - policy platform - other members indicating they would join the \u201cnativist\u201d caucus.

Congress can & should act to help prevent future attacks against the integrity of our presidential elections. One of the most dangerous theories surrounding the presidential election was that the Vice President somehow had the power to interfere in counting electoral votes. The Presidential ensures self-interested politicians cannot abuse the Electoral Count Act. Presidential elections are a cornerstone of our democracy & this bipartisan bill will ensure we protect our Constitution and future presidential elections.

This gesture underscores Cyprus's unwavering commitment to humanitarian efforts, reaffirming its status as a crucial ally. Together, we stand united in our mission to alleviate the suffering of those in need and bring relief to the people of Gaza. Today, I stood firm against the sale of fighter aircrafts, associated equipment, and munitions to Turkey. Let me be clear, Turkey has not earned the trust necessary for this deal to proceed. Erdogan has instead made it clear time and again that he will not cease his threats against neighboring NATO allies or begin to act the way a trusted ally of the United States should. Moreover, the Turkish government's disregard for human rights and its increasing render it an unstable and unreliable partner. I regret that the Biden green lighting of this sale did not seek greater assurances from Turkey on human rights and on stopping aggression against its neighbors. The Chinese have shown they're happy to see conflict in the world. It's time to and get our allies who were resistant to joining us on sanctions to now multilateralize them.

Aleksei Navalny was a fierce voice for democracy in Russia and against Putin\u2019s who was unfairly targeted and imprisoned for his activism.

Their bravery and sacrifice will never be forgotten. Keeping them in my thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. The Senate border deal is unacceptable. It would permanently change our immigration system w/o any relief for the million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., and major parts read like an enforcement wish list from the Trump Admin. Full statement Ukraine's future is in NATO and it's critical to map out what every step of that future looks like. We must ensure it is not just merely an invitation without a long term opportunity. It must be something more substantial. Today begins when we recognize Black Americans, their enormous contributions to the history, present, and future of our country, and their heroic struggles to make our nation a more perfect Union. One year ago, I stood alongside and my colleagues to announce historic funding for the Gateway Tunnel Project. Gateway is the most important infrastructure project in America and with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's funding, it grows closer to completion every day. I\u2019m heartbroken to learn that one of the three soldiers killed on January by an Iran-backed militia in Jordan was a native son of Willingboro, New Jersey \u2013 Sergeant William J. Rivers. My full statement: years ago, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act that I proudly championed officially took effect, representing a milestone for gender equality in the workplace. As we mark this anniversary, let's reaffirm our commitment to closing the gender wage gap once and for all. I\u2019m praying for the families of our brave servicemembers who were killed and hoping for a swift recovery for those injured. The U.S. must hold the Iran-backed militia accountable for its attack on U.S. troops in Jordan. For months, I have been raising the alarm bells on Iran\u2019s nefarious activities through its proxies. The U.S. must establish a strong deterrence, so this will not happen again. I warned the Biden Admin when they broadly eased sanctions in their deal with Maduro that follow through would be everything. The news out of Venezuela should result in sanctions being immediately reimposed and not lifted until Ms. Machado is able to run in a truly free election. On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, #WeRemember the millions of Jews murdered by the Nazis and pledge to #NeverForget the consequences of letting bigotry and antisemitism go unchecked. One year ago today, I proudly defended against the Biden Admin's attempt to undermine our nation's history of welcoming asylum seekers. As Congress considers reform, I urge not to capitulate to the who would sacrifice everything on the altar of demonizing immigrants. The NFIP Reauthorization Act I introduced lowers the statutory cap to A long-term reauthorization of the program must include robust funding for mitigation to decrease the risk profile of the program and provide a sound financial future for it. This is a victory for the rule of law and the protection of vulnerable migrants seeking refuge in America. SCOTUS rightfully stopped Texas from erecting draconian razor wiring that threatened the lives of vulnerable migrants and prevented border officials from doing their jobs. Today would have been the anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Yet years later, we\u2019re seeing the disastrous aftermath of the Dobbs decision as GOP lawmakers push for extreme bans. We must restore Roe and do everything we can to protect reproductive freedom. This decision by the Biden Administration will transform the lives of thousands of student borrowers. The Administration must continue to move forward with its efforts to provide student debt relief to more borrowers. Today, as we honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., let's recommit ourselves to the fight for justice, equality, and unity. Dr. King's dream lives on, inspiring us to build a brighter, more inclusive future for all. Just out of million arrests by Border Patrol of illegal border crossers resulted in fentanyl seizure. If we want to cut down on fentanyl trafficking, we must enhance our capabilities at those official points of entry where the vast majority of arrests take place. On this third anniversary of the January insurrection, let us remember the false claims of election fraud that fueled the events of that day. It's time to acknowledge the truth and hold those responsible accountable for their roles in the attack on our democracy. Happy New Year, New Jersey! As Kwanzaa begins, I'm wishing a bright and meaningful holiday to all celebrating! Merry Christmas! Sending best wishes to all celebrating today! El gobierno de EE.UU. debe asegurar que Daniel Ortega rinda cuentas por su continuo ataque contra los l\u00edderes religiosos del pa\u00eds. Estas acciones para socavar la democracia en Nicaragua son el resultado de los esfuerzos del r\u00e9gimen para acabar con el movimiento pro-democracia. The U.S. government must hold Daniel Ortega accountable for his continued all out assault against religious leaders. These actions continue to erode democracy in Nicaragua and are a result of Ortega\u2019s efforts to trounce pro-democracy activism. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his regime continue to demonstrate complete disregard for advancing the democratic reforms they agreed to under the Barbados Agreement. Instead, he is hellbent on strengthening its chokehold over the nation. My full statement: Keeping the family and loved ones, as well as the entire ABC Action News team, in our thoughts after last night\u2019s tragic helicopter crash that killed a pilot and photographer returning to Philly from an assignment at the Jersey Shore. Very pleased with the progress on Ukraine and Moldova at #EUCO. Agreement to open accession talks is a significant step forward. It's clear #EUCO has generated considerable positive developments for the region, fostering stronger ties and cooperation throughout Europe. If thinks he can send us home for the weekend, quietly cave to Republicans\u2019 anti-immigrant demands while nobody is watching, and then ambush Democrats expecting us to vote yes with a smile, he is TERRIBLY MISTAKEN. and those Democrats who are contemplating these proposals need to understand that these Trumpian policies will do nothing to address our challenges at the border and will only exacerbate the problem. Immigration advocates should speak up \u2014 HELL NO is the message. Reading the abhorrent immigration policy changes the is proposing, I thought I entered a time machine back to the Trump era. From expedited removals to deportation squads threatening millions who have called America home for years. It would be a complete betrayal. It is truly shameful that President Biden and his administration are considering selling out migrants and asylum seekers in order placate extreme Republicans who are jeopardizing our national security and that of our allies just to score a political point. My full statement: Outraged by the Texas Supreme Court's ruling against Kate Cox. This is a pivotal moment post-Roe, exposing the dire consequences of restrictive abortion laws. We cannot stand by while women are stripped of their freedom to make crucial health decisions. During this morning's crucial meeting with President Zelenskyy, it was clear that Ukraine needs our help NOW. This is a defining moment for democracies. We can't afford to wait. It's time to act decisively and ensure Putin does not win this war. President Biden is badly mistaken to think Democrats in Congress will agree to Trump-era, anti-immigrant policies. Republicans in Congress are not serious about solving our challenges at the border and we should not capitulate to their harmful demands. My full statement: This is outrageous. The disappearance of Alexei Navalny demands immediate international attention. This blatant move by Putin is an affront to justice and democracy. The world must condemn this egregious violation of human rights. On let's reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental principles of dignity, equality, and justice for all. Together, we strive to build a world where every individual's rights are respected and protected. Today and every day, let's stand united for human rights. years ago, an antisemitic attack in Jersey City shook our state to its core. Today, we remember the victims, their families, and those injured on that horrific day. We must stand with NJ's Jewish community and work to root out hate in all its forms. Monitoring the upcoming coastal storm on the East Coast this weekend. Anticipating heavy rains, strong winds, and potential travel disruptions. Adhere to safety precautions and stay informed on weather updates. . is mistaken if he thinks Ds in Congress will agree to gut our asylum system in exchange for desperately needed aid for our allies. He cannot give right-wing extremists the sense that they can sacrifice everything on the altar of harming immigrants. Happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating the Festival of Lights! As family and friends gather to kindle the first candle tonight, let's reflect on the enduring spirit of hope, unity, and resilience. May the glow of the menorah brighten our lives with joy and peace. Chag Sameach! On this solemn anniversary of #PearlHarbor, we honor the courage and sacrifice of those who served and remember the lives lost on December Let us never forget the lessons of history and remain steadfast in our commitment to peace and freedom for all. I want to congratulate on being confirmed as the new U.S. Ambassador to Croatia. She will serve our country with distinction and be a powerful advocate for American interests and leadership in Europe. On #WorldAIDSDay, we are once again reminded of Congress's failure to renew PEPFAR. We can't waver in our global fight against HIV/AIDS. This setback sends the wrong message to our partners, especially in Africa. We must #RenewPEPFAR. Lives are at stake. Deeply saddened by the passing of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the trailblazer who broke barriers as the first woman on the Supreme Court. Her legacy in shaping American law is immense. My condolences to her family and all who were inspired by her. Proud to see the confirmation of Jamel Semper to the U.S. District Court of NJ. His relentless commitment to public service combined with the trust he's built with New Jerseyans is exactly what we look for in a judge. He will no doubt be an asset to New Jersey\u2019s federal bench. It's absurd to claim that the price for assisting our international allies is gutting our asylum laws. We can't stand by while a few Senators negotiate policy changes in total darkness that will gut our asylum laws and force undocumented immigrants to stay in the shadows. I'm gravely concerned about reports of oil and tar balls off the coast along Long Branch and Monmouth Beach. We must get to the bottom of this. I'm ready to help deliver the needed federal resources to ensure this contamination is cleaned up expeditiously. My joint statement with , , , , , , , , , and on the Proposed Threats to our Asylum System in the Supplemental Aid Package Negotiations: Putin\u2019s decision to extend NJ native Evan Gershkovich\u2019s unjust detention goes to show his deep disdain for democracy & freedom of the press. Russia must release Evan & all journalists unfairly detained. The U.S. must do everything possible to ensure his release. #IStandWithEvan I\u2019m heartened to hear of the safe return of hostages from Gaza. The release of individuals, including many children, is a testament to the power of diplomacy. While this news is certainly welcome, the work must continue until every hostage is home safe with their families. I welcome the two day extension of the pause in the Israel-Hamas war, allowing the release of more hostages being held by Hamas. However, as we continue to work with Israel and our partners, we must all remain vigilant of Hamas\u2019 actions and ensure they are ultimately defeated. I'm appalled by the senseless shooting of three Palestinian students in Vermont. Hate has no place in our society, and this heinous act must be condemned. My heart goes out to the victims and their families. We must stand united against all forms of discrimination and violence. Support your local community and celebrate Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and your patronage can make a big difference. Shop local, shop small, and help your community thrive! Happy Thanksgiving! It's a time to gather with loved ones, express gratitude, and savor the abundance of life. Let's appreciate the blessings we have and extend a hand to those in need. May your Thanksgiving be filled with joy, love, and delicious feasts. I\u2019m pleased to see the Biden Administration brokered a brief humanitarian pause in the Israel-Hamas War that will allow for the safe release of hostages, mostly women and children, being unjustly held by Hamas. My full statement: Today a grateful nation mourns the passing of First Lady Rosalynn Carter \u2014 a true public servant and trailblazer who embodied the best of America\u2019s values each and every day. She was a strong champion for mental health care, caregiving, civil rights, and women\u2019s rights. First Lady Rosalynn Carter left an indelible mark on our nation \u2014 a legacy that will undoubtedly inspire generations to come. My sincerest condolences go to President Carter and the rest of the Carter family on this profound loss. May her memory always be a blessing. Tonight, I joined my Democratic & Republicans colleagues in doing the fiscally responsible thing. We passed a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the govt open \u2014 avoiding a shutdown w/o caving into House Republican demands for draconian budget cuts or MAGA policy objectives. In the coming weeks, however, Democrats must stand united against poison pills & steep budget cuts that will only threaten our national security & hurt working families, servicemembers & veterans, & small businesses in New Jersey & across the country. Republicans, esp. those in the House, must embrace bipartisanship to fund the govt instead of continuously attempting to hurl us off a fiscal cliff to score cheap political points. Mindless brinksmanship is not how adults run a country & the American people deserve better. In the two years since the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law, New Jersey has seen billions of dollars in federal investments for our infrastructure. We\u2019re well on our way to getting the Gateway project done and revitalizing the transportation networks we all rely on. November is a time to recognize and celebrate the incredible sacrifices and unwavering support of our military families. Let's honor their strength, resilience, and dedication to our nation. Thank you for your service on the homefront! I applaud 's nomination of Adeel Mangi to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I was honored to call him and share that I would strongly encourage the President to make him the first Muslim American nominated for a seat on our federal appeals courts. I was proud to deliver the federal funding that is making the expansion of full-day pre-school a reality for more than NJ communities. One of the most important and valuable investments we can make is in funding early childhood education. My full statement: November is a time to remember and honor those affected by this devastating disease. Let's work together to raise awareness, support research, and promote early detection. Together, we can make a difference in the fight against lung cancer. Wishing you a joyous and radiant #Diwali! May the Festival of Lights bring warmth, happiness, and the triumph of light over darkness into your life. Let's celebrate the spirit of love, unity, and new beginnings with family and friends. Happy Diwali! November is a time to celebrate the rich cultures, traditions, and contributions of Native Americans. Let's honor the diverse heritage and history of Indigenous peoples and work towards a more inclusive and equitable future for all. On #VeteransDay, we honor and express our deep gratitude to all the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve in the armed forces.

I hope you will take a moment to read about some of the most recent efforts to address this threat and lessen its impact:", "Extremely concerning The America I grew up in would find this abhorrent. Spot on. Biden propaganda. Truth. Liberals: if we don't like the outcomes let's change the rules. House GOP majority: since you have done nothing to close our border how about this idea: shut down the government until the border is shut down? Senate passes billion to protect Ukraine and Israels borders. Novel idea: protect OUR borders! Biden escapes charges for being too feeble-minded? Two. Justice. Systems. This illegal alien tore down a NY homeowner's flag and then punched and choked the homeowner. Here is his message to America. Suicide by spending. Textbook definition of gaslighting: Biden: 'Every day between now and the election the American people will know that the only reason the border is not secure is Donald Trump and his MAGA friends.' President Biden DOES NOT need new legislation to fix the border catastrophe HE STARTED. National suicide by invasion. Hold your elected officials accountable for their votes. Deport. Congress - a co-equal branch of government - needs to counter balance an over zealous Executive branch. The Biden economy is fueled by deficit government spending. This will not end well. We don't have a revenue problem - governments appetite for YOUR money is insatiable. Suicide by spending but career pols turn a blind eye. Biden loves \"Democracy\" as long as his enemies sit beind bars. I didn't realize President of the United States is a part-time job. How is this not treason? The invasion is getting worse. When is reelected a massive deportation program needs to happen. What are we going to do about this GOP controlled House? Brett Loyd's poll is spot on. We need to demand recorded floor votes in the House and Senate. There is no double standard . . . said no one ever. Illegal immigration costs American taxpayers over annually. WHY do we put up with it? Spot on correct. Drain. The. Swamp. Add to that list: How do you plan to balance the budget? Will you hold a recorded floor vote for term limits? Suicide by Spending. Is the FBI investigating this? Or are they more worried about parents questioning school boards? This is categorized as \"saving democracy\". Federal govt spending was equal to of GDP last year. This is a make believe economy. Most Americans understand this is election interference . Impeach America Last Biden. This is treason. I hope the state this occurred in has the death penalty. Stop the madness - impeach Biden. Clarion call to the lap dogs. Suicide by spending. This will allow fraud on a massive scale. \"Registered\" voters - who didn't vote - will be voted Democrat by the deep state. Why do the Bidens have offshore bank accounts? Biden has made it a part-time job. Very predictable. Democrats need to justify ballot harvesting and mailing voting. WHEN, if ever, will the fight back? When is Biden going to take this test? Why? Spot on re \"fake conservatives\". This why the left calls us \"conspiracy theorists\" if we dare question irregularities in elections. Yet another example of why most Americans distrust the media. PLEASE keep him away from the nuclear bomb codes. Spending taxpayer money is always BIPARTISAN. Shameful. Wheres the accountability? Spot on . The invasion and abetted by Joe Biden. No President Biden - trillion deficits are the \"wacko notion\". Be afraid. Be very afraid. Americans have taken a pay cut every month since Biden has been in office . . . (inflation). Biden has refused to speak with any reporter who isn't pre-approved from a very short list in the past FIVE MONTHS. Let's elect a President that puts Americans first. Cut CSPAN's cord. National suicide by spending. Will the WH be held accountable for lying? Two justice systems. What has the FBI become? Biden gives billion of taxpayer money to bail out mismanaged Teamsters union pension fund. per participant. DRAIN. THE. SWAMP. IMPEACH. Not raising the debt limit does NOT mean the US will default on its loans. Big government wants you to believe that. The administration tell us that the Trump and Biden classified docs cases are \"apples & oranges\". Of course they are - one is Republican and one is Democrat. After passing wasteful trillion Omnibus the Senate is going to tell the private sector how to run it's business. Where is our state run media on this story? We have a political class in Washington that doesn't give a damn about the American taxpayer. Uncontrolled immigration will end our country. It's impeachable behavior by Biden. The left knows that a dependent voter is a dependable vote. Fiddling while Rome is burning. The most tone-deaf administration in my lifetime.", "Even with insurance, Americans have to pay thousands of dollars for drugs to treat cancer and multiple sclerosis. I asked FDA Commissioner Califf why the FDA isn't allowing more affordable generic alternatives for lifesaving drugs. Rocky is one of my favorite movies of all time and even I agree!

Thank you to my Chief of Staff Geo Saba, Director of Constituent Services Simeone Chien, and District Director Tom\u2026 I pressed FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf to make a commitment not to accept Big Pharma consulting fees after he leaves office. If you're regulating Big Pharma, you shouldn't be taking money from Big Pharma. Period.

Wishing everyone celebrating in and across the globe a blessed Eid. The Doomsday Clock is set at seconds to midnight, the closest it\u2019s ever been.

My bill with would lower the cost of most brand name drugs in the US by We put almost trillion into the Pentagon and the defense budget. It\u2019s shameful that we can\u2019t get million allocated right away to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.

Cancel medical debt and pass Medicare for All. Thrilled to have leading our efforts on The State-Based Universal Health Care Act in the Senate! As we continue to fight for Medicare for All, this bill will support universal healthcare at the state level. Today is AANHPI Women\u2019s Equal Pay Day, a reminder that Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander women are paid just cents for every dollar paid to white men. The Paycheck Fairness Act will help close the pay gap and ensure fair wages. Let's pass it. It\u2019s not radical to have a wage for fast food workers. I sent a letter urging leaders in California to get this done. I\u2019m glad to see this victory for the workers and advocates who have been speaking up. You can\u2019t talk about reducing our national debt without talking about the defense budget that privileges defense contractors\u2019 profits over a modern national security strategy and investments at home. Let\u2019s rein in wasteful spending at the Pentagon. It's time to call out Medicare Advantage for what it is: private insurance that uses the Medicare brand to profit. My bill with and , the Save Medicare Act, will help hold private insurance accountable and strengthen real Medicare. We need to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge by the end of the year. China would do this in a few months. That means Congress should allocate the million it needs, agencies should get the permitting done, and we should be increasing US steel production to meet the demand. Happy Easter to everyone celebrating in and around the world. Wishing you and your loved ones a meaningful and joyful day. Medicare for All will save nearly lives and billion per year. It's a good economic policy that will keep Americans healthy and safe. If you are working for one of the richest companies in the world, you shouldn\u2019t be struggling just to get by. We need to pass a minimum wage and guarantee the right for every worker to unionize their workplace. I\u2019m heartbroken to hear that the six victims in the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore were construction workers. They were also immigrants, including Miguel Luna, a father of three from El Salvador, who had been working for the construction company for over a decade. These workers were from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, doing hazardous construction work. Immigrants are working dangerous jobs to help rebuild our infrastructure and our industrial base. It is sad that they are too often demonized by politicians. We need an economy and immigration system that treats everyone with dignity to be the strongest nation we can be in the century.

Together they have long been leaders in our Naples Community, with John serving on our City Council & distinguishing himself as a land use & zoning expert. He will be greatly missed Liberal prosecutors are using uniquely high bail as a weapon against Trump in the asset valuation case in addition to misusing the law under which he is being prosecuted. Our country was founded by people who no longer wanted to live in fear of a repressive government. Now we have weaponization of government power that will erode our Constitutional rights and undermine our Republic. The ignomy that the Biden admin has brought to the US has reached a new high as the nation of Niger expelled us, despite our having spent millions to help them fight terrorists. We are no longer feared by our adversaries, certainly not China, Russia, Iran, N. Korea, and now Niger On Monday President Biden said he is \u201ccounting on the border action happening by itself.\u201d Maybe he thinks some of the long departed heads of state like Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterand he keeps talking to will take care of our border? Regardless of your opinion on Donald Trump, he should not be removed from any state's ballot. In America, voters determine elections. The Rule of Law is a core principle of our democratic republic, and the outrageous million judgment against Donald Trump for a supposed \u2018crime\u2019 in which no money was lost is a dangerous abridgement of it. There have been cases brought under this statute and this is only one where no financial loss occurred. It is a raw power play to squeeze him into posting bond for his appeal - pure weaponization of the government against a citizen. Biden defies the Supreme Court and pursues student debt elimination for the time- dictator-like behavior. This is in addition to similar actions taken unilaterally by his EPA and SEC, which the SCOTUS will be reviewing. And he criticizes Donald Trump? Would Putin have killed Navalny if Reagan were president? Or would he have invaded Crimea? I don\u2019t think so. The House can\u2019t accomplish much but they\u2019re adept at spending taxpayer money. This week they approved a massive expansion of tax credits & housing subsidies which will advance a socialist agenda & take us closer to providing \u2018universal basic income\u2019, a core liberal Sadly, of Republicans voted for it. Even though of Americans from both parties want Congressional term limits the inhabitants there don\u2019t. Again the House quashed a term limit bill. When they say elections are term limits it ignores & depreciates the huge power of incumbency-Once you\u2019re in it\u2019s not hard to stay Last year we taxpayers gave million to Yemen and in return we get drones attacking our ships and disrupting world shipping. Several thousand of Houthi recipients of our generosity protested in Sana\u2019a yesterday - the usual \u2018death to America\u2019 chants. Great trade for the Biden administration but even worse, they are deferring implementation of the \u2018state sponsor of terrorism\u2019 designation that imposes sanctions on them. Yesterday the UN Security Council voted to condemn the Houthis attacks on Red Sea shipping, and Russia, China, Mozambique and South Algeria abstained. Our State Dept would call this a \u2018diplomatic victory\u2019 because they abstained instead of opposing it. We feel we need to keep giving funds to countries that act against our interests- I would suggest not, hold them accountable for their actions vis a vis our country. The travesty of Claudine Gay at Harvard continues. Having failed to substitute \u201cher truth\u201d for academic freedom, she is still being paid more thsn per year. Transforming diversity as a means to a more fair society into an end in itself is still rewarded at Harvard. Despite recognizing that Romania & Bulgaria are deeply tied to trafficking of drugs, arms & people, the European Union feels they meet all the requirements for admittance into the Schengen visa area. Interesting to know that some governments are more clueless than our current one After repeated attempted cover-ups of Hunter Biden\u2019s criminality & corruption we now learn that President Biden\u2019s daughter owes of back taxes in Pennsylvania. It clear that the Bidens, from the president down, think they are above the law. With passive acquiescence, so far, of the Biden administration, Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro is threatening to take over the Esequibo region of Guyana and its large new oil fields. Exxon is drilling there. Maria Corina Machado, the only opposition candidate, supports the territorial integrity of Guyana. Let\u2019s see what our government does. Biden already relaxed sanctions on Venezuela in exchange for supposed tolerance in the upcoming elections, which Maduro promptly backtracked on. Elite university presidents and faculty call inciting antisemitism and genocide of jews \u201cfree speech\u201d but do not consider embracing speakers from moderate and conservative points of view to provide counters to the liberal party line to also be \u201cfree speech\u201d Universities were founded to seek learning and intellectual broadening and now they are narrow, radical and politicized weaponry. The conf in Dubai is calling for an end to eating meat to reduce methane emissions while eating meat & flying there on private jets. If serious people instead of liberal dilettantes, they\u2019d call for a carbon tax, the end of coal & use of natural gas & new nuclear technology The passing of Henry Kissinger marks the end of an era of United States foreign policy supremacy. From Dean Acheson to Dr. Henry Kissinger, our leading diplomats were heard and respected throughout the world. Now our president can\u2019t even get some world leaders to call him back. We know the UN is a problem for the US & developed countries, but we keep paying for the pleasure of taking a beating by them. After the resolution against Israel, which did not even mention Hamas, Iran was been picked to head up the \u2018social forum\u2019 of the UN Human Rights Council At last something to agree on with Elizabeth Warren- she\u2019s finally realized the crooked deal in Obamacare that protects United Health has raised drug prices in the US. In Congress I tried to get rid of PBM\u2019s but had near unanimous bipartisan opposition While the US is mired in racial and cultural divisions, China keeps moving forward. It controls of the world\u2019s rate earth minerals and is now leasing most of a large deposit under the Pacific, ignominiously right next to Hawaii. Ethnic Studies Faculty Council wants UC to stop referring to Hamas\u2019 attack on Israeli civilians as a terrorist attack, uplift Palestine\u2019s freedom struggle, & stand against Israel\u2019s war crimes. I\u2019m glad I live in Florida where freedom lives & values count When will the United States stand up against the UN? We pay for them to beat us up, which is perverse. Yesterday the head of the UN defended Hamas and its actions. Did we respond? No. Yesterday President Biden met with muslim groups who seek a cease fire in Gaza, but he made no call for the obvious - that innocent Palestinians must publicly renounce Hamas and take respnsibility for their fate. Double standards strike again: crooked Bernie Sanders gives of his campaign funds to his wife and stepson\u2019s foundation - with of those funds going to salaries. First Hunter Biden and now this. People need to see these guys for what they are. We should immediately present the video and data we have on the Hamas brutal, inhumane attack on its own hospital to the United Nations, as Adlai Stevenson did in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Are we still strong enough to do that? Hamas\u2019 aggression and brutality must be answered. Israel is doing what must be done to root out terrorists and defend itself. I am encouraged to see the United States being strong in supporting our greatest Middle East ally. Hamas\u2019 aggresion & brutality must be answered. It appears Israel is ready to take it to them & fortunately our govt is speaking up clearly & consistently on behalf of Israel. The intractable violence & inhumanity of radical islamic groups will continue until they\u2019re Appeasement will only make things worse. Just years ago we saw the same agression from Hezbollah in Lebanon. Black Lives Matter has always been, and continues to be, a socialist organization hell bent on destroying the norms of society. They are a fringe group that has shown their true colors with their antisemitic views. The Palestinians tried to wipe out the Jews in Palestine in long before the estblishment of the State of Israel. This Anti-Israel enmity is longstanding and pervasive, and needs to be completely eradicated. Another disastrous move by the Biden Administration - billion to Iran so they can attack Israel. Now they defend Iran saying that they weren\u2019t involved despite global evidence to the contrary. Once again Hamas has shown that diversion, by resorting to terror, instead of providing for the Palestinian people is the easiest way out for them. Clearly Palestine is not interested in negotiating for statehood. As Reagan said, \u201cThere you go again\u201d Yet another Bidenism that \u201cWe don\u2019t want to contain China\u201d but somehow, contrary to their behavior during the since they acceded to the WTO, China is going to do this? Bring on the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy At the last the majority of members firmly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine. No such specific denunciation has come from the current summit. Does anyone take Pres. Biden or the US seriously? They want our money but not alignment. Maybe we should turn off the spigot. It\u2019s important to have people in politics that have built businesses, bought businesses, and run businesses. Glenn Youngkin certainly fits that bill. He\u2019s refreshing from that point of Here they go again. First, talks with Venezuela about buying its oil, now release of billions to Iran. The Biden Administration wishful thinkers are again putting the United States at risk. Weakness is our standard now. Default would not be in the best interest of our country and the Fiscal Responsibility Act would avoid that while getting some spending reductions. The bloated spending bills I voted against in Congress and the obscene spending the last years are the real problem. Beware of the outsized state taking advantage of its citizens. Here is another in a long continuum of government aggression. Are we alive for the purpose of serving the state? Coincidentally, the Supreme Court ruled yesterday against Biden\u2019s unwarranted revival of an Obama overreach, restricting the scope of \u2018the waters of the United States act\u2019 which seeks to impede American property rights. Congress must balance the need for border security with the need for workers. Secure the border, fix our visa and asylum systems, and finally solve the immigration issue instead of using it as a political football. For years I've spoken on the need to fix our broken & leaking visa system while securing our border. Congress has failed to act & President Biden has made the problem significantly worse by issuing Executive Orders related to the border. Sovereign nations need secure borders Congress must raise the debt ceiling - defaulting would be catastrophic to our nation. Congress must also CUT spending - the current levels are unsustainable. This should be a bipartisan belief, not a controversial one. China is amassing greater weapons capability, expanding its military footprint around the world, and surveilling countries that it is competing with - what is the end This agreement is not in the best interest of Middle East peace - providing a larger stage for an Iranian government that is a state sponsor of terror is never the right thing to do. This is great news for Florida's ecology and economy. It is exciting to see the hard work that we put in to get this project supported and funded finally come to fruition. Much is left to be done, but this is a major accomplishment. We should have shot the Chinese spy balloon down when it entered US airspace over Alaska - the test for effective response is \u201cwhat would Reagan do?\u201d Pope Benedict was a strong supporter of the US-in particular the Amendment. He understood the unique role the Holy See can play in world affairs, & was the Pope to increase accountability for abuse & establish a process for allegations to be referred to civil authorities. Kathleen and I wish a Merry Christmas to all! As we enjoy time with family and friends, let us remember the reason we celebrate ICYMI: With a small Republican majority in the House of Representatives and a slim Democrat majority in the Senate \u2014 is it a recipe for disaster or an opportunity to finally work across party lines? In case you missed it. My interview with this evening... Republicans have strong options in We should cut off financial support for the corrupt South African government. This is another offensive sign of how weak the US is perceived around the world right now. The king of Saudi Arabia wouldn\u2019t even take Biden\u2019s phone call. Time to refocus America This is a reminder that freedom and liberty will ultimately prevail over repressive The Iranian people have finally had enough. God rest Queen Elizabeth II. Her dignity, grace, and sense of duty to her Nation was second to none. In addition to her loyalty to the British Kingdom, she was also a great friend of the American people. She will be greatly missed. Kathleen and I are saddened by the news of today's tragic accident that claimed the life of Rep. Jackie Walorski, as well as the lives of Emma Thomson, and Zachery Potts. We offer our condolences to their families. Jackie served the people of Indiana well and stood firm in her values and those of her constituents - it was an honor to serve with her. If Biden and the Dems understood how the marketplace works, they would not push this semiconductor bailout (CHIPS Act). President Trump had the right idea- cut off imports so companies will onshore and near-shore alternate production on their own, without fleecing taxpayers. The Biden Admin should stop its war on the energy business instead of cozying up to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. After the visit to Saudi Arabia, MBS has Biden\u2019s number. We can be energy independent in the U.S. if the government would get out of the way. The Supreme Court's decision today not only supports life, but is also right. Devolving authority to the states to regulate abortion, where the people\u2019s voice is directly heard, is proper. The Order of Isabela la Catolica is an important and prestigious honor for which I am deeply thankful to Ambassador Cabanas and His Majesty King Felipe. Our relations with Spain are broad and deep. We share strong ties of nurturing democratic principles, mutual defense & economic cooperation among our two nations. Spain is a critical ally in our common objectives of peace, prosperity and global stability. Thank you for such a wonderful honor. The Summit of the Americas is yet another display of weakness by the Biden admin. Some, such as Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO) & the leaders of Honduras, Guatemala, & El Salvador didn\u2019t even show up. Many of the leaders that did are critical of the A strong America that takes the lead in world affairs is needed - and it's absent under this administration. We should close our border with Mexico before the Tapachula caravan arrives and tell AMLO that these are his people to deal with. As to the other no shows, we should cut them off. No aid, no assistance. Nothing. What happened to the Amendment? The \"Disinformation Police\" sure sounds a lot like something from the Soviet Union, not America. I wonder how much money the U.S. gives to the countries who voted against suspending Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council and how how much we give to the countries who abstained? We should cut them off. The US should cut all aid to South Africa. If they want to support Russia by remaining neutral, then let Russia support them. The Ukraine conflict is an all-out struggle for the legitimacy of democracy and state sovereignty in the century. Israel won't criticize Russian aggression in the Ukraine? Maybe the United States should suspend some of the life support we give them. This is a time to take names and keep score of who is in and who is not. This is terrible policy and is only helping one corrupt and abusive autocrat over another. It is an administration sacrificing all principle of US foreign policy seeking short term gain - which will be illusory anyway, as gas prices regularize. All of these actions must continue well past the Ukraine conflict, and until Russia returns to post-Cold War reforms and accepts the sovereignty of the Baltic states as well as Ukraine. \"This started under Obama when they took the missiles out of Poland that George W. Bush put there in ICYMI: My interview about the Russian attack on Ukraine with last night. When we see massive NATO mobilization in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia we might believe that the west means business in opposing Putin. Otherwise it is just talk, which is cheap. Putin's aggression should be met with strong sanctions by all Western Democracies. NATO nations must unequivocally condemn Russia's actions and apply pressure, including by realigning operations from its secure nest in Brussels to at-risk NATO frontline nations in the Weakness and vacillation now will only stimulate more aggression by Russia and their allies, China and Iran. ICYMI, my interview about on CNN last evening. Thanks to for hosting and for joining in. Germany has abandoned the US & Europe to serve its narrow short term interests. They caved to the radicals and stopped nuclear power & are now dependent on Russia. We are placing troops on heightened alert - Russia has times that on the border. The ruling is correctly supporting freedom of speech but the question is why not defend it vs safe spaces, cancelled speakers, and intimidation of conservatives on campuses? If we are serious about protecting the former USSR satellite countries, as we should be, we need hard power behind them, not obtuse talk. It has nothing to do with who is or is not in NATO. This is Putin vs. the US. Russia cannot be given permission to advance on Ukraine. ICYMI - an exciting and important new endeavor by the - the January Project. We have a legitimate government interest in protecting US strategic interests, critical supply chains and technology. US corporations should not be allowed to undermine these interests for narrow, short term profit. ICYMI: My interview with @NewDay o ICYMI: We need term limits for Members of Congress. One more troubling sign of China's growing influence around the globe and the total failure of world powers to stand up to them. China must be challenged on their manipulation and lying. Kathleen and I are saddened by the passing of a great business leader and Congressman, . Our prayers are with his family at this difficult time. Eliminating the burning of coal is a first step in mitigating effects of climate change. A fee on carbon is the most efficient, free market solution to accomplish this goal. ICYMI: My interview with - we need term limits for the U.S. Congress. On the heels of US companies asking the Biden admin to reduce tariffs against Chinese exporters this week, yet another US leading corporation buckles under pressure from China. If we are to impede China\u2019s dominance, our gov't will have to take the lead.", "George H.W. Bush served our country in a capacity few human beings can ever claim: warrior, lawmaker, ambassador, Intelligence Chief, Vice President and President. His entire life embodied giving of himself. We have not only lost a former president, but a premier example of what service really means. Rest in peace, Mr. President. #OTD: November Oklahoma was the state admitted to the Union! I am proud to be a fifth generation Oklahoman and to represent the Fifth District of Oklahoma in Congress. Happy Oklahoma Statehood Day. We\u2019ve accomplished a lot over the last two years, for Oklahoma and for our country. We've passed more than bills out of the House -- more than average. In the House we're prioritizing YOUR choices when it comes to healthcare by providing local, affordable solutions to solve the problem of growing premiums. Those choices should be yours \u2014 because at the end of the day, YOU know what\u2019s best for you, not the government. There's more work to do, but we have made great strides. We are on the right path. The work cannot stop -- let's keep going. The economy is BOOMING. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Read for yourself At the grand opening of Kratos\u2019 square-foot production facility in #OKC this morning. They create cutting-edge technology for our military so our soldiers can keep our country safe. Here\u2019s one of their jet-powered drones. Very impressive. Kratos puts cutting-edge technology for unmanned aircraft in the hands of our military \u2014 and that will keep our country safe. For the past years & I worked to get Kratos to Oklahoma because we believe in protecting our country. We must give our military tools they need to keep us safe. Now Kratos can make those tools in our state. Today\u2019s a great day for for Oklahoma & for America. Today\u2019s numbers make it clear our economy is on the right path: Speaking with the Vietnamese Public Radio this a.m. Be sure to tune in! Here at the Southern Oaks Learning and Wellness Center grand opening in #OKC today. This center will provide immunizations and quality healthcare for some of the neediest people in our community.

Toured the Oklahoma National Stockyards in #OKC today with @SecretarySonny and and OK Ag Sec. Reese. Great to meet with them and with students from FFA and ! Just about every week there\u2019s a cattle auction at Oklahoma National Stockyards, but it\u2019s not every day the Secretary of Agriculture is auctioned off too @SecretarySonny In #OKC talking Oklahoma agriculture over lunch with @SecretarySonny and members of the Oklahoma delegation. Had the privilege of visiting in #OKC recently. This manufacturer makes caulk and weatherproofing materials to keep our homes safe from the elements. They\u2019ve been been based here in OKC for nearly years & are a prime example of an American success story. Evil still lurks in the world. The hateful and horrific attack on Jewish worshippers is a reminder to all to fight for religious accommodation as embodied in our First Amendment. Please pray for the Jewish community, Pittsburgh and America. Something tells me Dahlia is going to go a long way making a difference in our community. Fun morning and great breakfast with and folks at Around the Corner in Edmond today! Attacks on current and former national leaders are unacceptable. These acts have no place in America. We may have different backgrounds, have different opinions and have different political affiliations, but an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. The single most important element that holds together our nation is UNITY. If we are to live freely and want to defend the America we know and love, we must act civilly. It is past time to put the country ahead of ourselves. Yesterday I had the privilege of spending time with many of our hard workers in and I stopped by to tour their facility in OKC. We talked about jobs, tariffs and other issues impacting our community. Thanks for having us! Humbled to receive the Statesman of the Year award at the Annual Clergy Appreciation luncheon today. One of the greatest honors of my life is to express my love of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Thank you for selecting me for this award! Toured Amazon's new square-foot facility with in #OKC this morning. What an impressive place. Glad recognizes opportunity in Oklahoma and we are very excited about the new jobs and business it will bring! I am beyond proud to support the energy industry in Oklahoma and was honored to speak with and the fine workers in our energy industry this afternoon. The daily things we often take for granted \u2013 like plastics, medicines, asphalt on our roads and heating for our food and homes \u2013 are a direct result of the tireless work of oil and gas workers. This industry keeps our community and our country moving forward. Rather than be ashamed of something so vital to the human race and to our state, we should embrace what the energy industry provides for billions of people. Their lives and our country depend on it. And we should celebrate that. God bless our first responders helping Florida recover from Congratulations to the Edmond Santa Fe High School volleyball team on another amazing state championship win! Proud to support this legislation to help our pilots and support our aviation industry in Oklahoma. The Office of Foreign Assets Control\u2019s role in the award of taxpayer funds to an organization involved in directly supporting Osama bin Laden raises many questions. Read more about our House Oversight investigation here It's time! #ThunderUp Glad to be there to support! With each walk we get closer and closer to finding a cure. #EndAlz Our country wouldn't be what it is today without the hard work of our nation's farmers, who devote their lives and work hard to feed us all. Thank you! Happy #okpol My statement on the release of U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson: Happy birthday, Ms. Harrison!", "Today is the anniversary of the International Religious Freedom Act. Freedom to have a faith and live it out or have no faith at all is a basic human right. On we remember & pray for those who are oppressed for their faith around the world. Dropped by w/ today to tour the facility and get a chance to connect w/ workers to discuss the impact of tariffs on hiring, immigration issues, & more. Great to visit w/ employees & tour the new ft. Delivery Facility in OKC w/ today. We\u2019re excited for the new job opportunities & expanded delivery options for OK customers. Oklahomans shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay for someone else\u2019s when they\u2019re already paying more for everything with Bidenomics. The fundamental right of every person to live your faith must be recognized throughout the world. & I are grateful that so many advocates continue to join our fight to protect religious freedom for all people. Oklahomans\u2014Tax Day is days away. Make sure to check all your documents and filings to avoid any penalties Iran\u2019s foreign minister is planning to come to the US next week for meetings at the United Nations. Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Houthis are all currently attacking our ally Israel with weapons supplied by Iran. The Biden Admin can and should stop the Iranian foreign minister\u2019s entry into the US. We should not allow our soil to be a platform for his support of terrorism. The Senate has never abandoned its constitutional duty to hold an impeachment trial. We are calling on Senate Majority Leader Schumer not to abandon it now Every year, CMS releases reimbursement rates for health services where some doctors face up to cuts\u2014this is not sustainable for Oklahoma physicians who are trying to provide quality care to Oklahomans. I\u2019m pushing my colleagues to work on real, long-term solutions to adjust the fee schedule in order to reduce the yearly cuts facing physicians. The conversation on life is happening in every state across the country and needs to start with a simple question\u2014when is a child a child? No one should live in fear because of their faith and heritage. & I are introducing the Countering Antisemitism Act to affirm the right for our Jewish friends and neighbors to live their faith freely like all Americans. China and Huawei remain significant national security threats to the US and our allies. We cannot step back from protecting our technology. Americans are rightly frustrated with the chaos the Biden Admin has created at our border. In yrs, almost M people have illegally crossed the border. That is unacceptable. The border needs to be secured now. Hats off to the for stopping by the US Capitol during their visit to DC! Great to talk about the latest on the Farm Bill and the ongoing work to support the ag community in Oklahoma. Under President Biden\u2019s policies, Oklahomans are paying more at the pump, at the register, and on their monthly bills. Oklahomans are tired of footing the bill for wasteful federal government spending. We need policies in DC that are focused on lowering our national debt and correct the broken federal budget process that continues to waste taxpayer dollars. President Biden has taken executive action on our southern border to open it up. He has taken several executive actions to repeal the policies that actually secured our border. I am doubtful that President Biden will do anything to secure our border. There are things Congress needs to do, but there\u2019s a lot President Biden could do now to stop the chaos. Border Patrol\u2019s primary mission is to stop the flow of illicit drugs and illegal immigration across our borders. Rolling back restrictions on illegal drug use for recruits puts America's national security at risk. Make no mistake\u2014America stands with our friend & ally, Israel, & the democratically elected leaders of Israel. My resolution w/ affirms that when Hamas attacked innocent Israeli civilians on Oct. the Israeli government had every right to respond & defend themselves. The mission of a Border Patrol agent is to protect our nation against illegal drugs\u2014CBP\u2019s latest reversal on policy directly contradicts what they stand for. I\u2019m calling on Acting Commissioner Miller to immediately reverse the policy that lowers the threshold for recent marijuana use for recruits. Read more There is no doubt that America is divided on when life begins. We should continue to talk about the simple question: when does life begin, or more simply stated, when is a child a child? In the landmark decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court said, 'The authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected That means every elected representative, federal, and state. Abortion is not a political question for the child in the womb. Every child has value and worth. I visited the site of the Nova music festival earlier this week in Israel. On Oct people were killed in a terrorist attack & people were taken hostage by Hamas. We cannot forget the hostages who are still being held by Hamas or the grief of the families. I just returned from Israel where I met with the families of the hostages still being held by Hamas. Since October, the world seems to have forgotten that on October Israel was ruthlessly attacked by Hamas terrorists during the Jewish holiday of Shemini Atzeret. America should be clear in our strong support for Israel, and I made it clear to Israeli leadership that they are our friend and ally. Today we recognize the spouses of those service members that gave the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. They continue on the legacy of their fallen loved one. It is now our duty to continue to support them and their families. I spent the last week in Israel meeting with our friend and ally because I know American weakness is a gift to Hamas. While Hamas is holding Americans hostage in Gaza, Biden is lecturing Israel on human rights. Today, Hamas launched another salvo of rockets toward civilians in Israel while President Biden declared he wants to change policy toward Israel. We all want the peace and protection of civilians, but you cannot pacify terrorists. The Biden Admin is weaponizing the tax code against American energy producers. President Biden\u2019s plan will raise costs for Oklahomans even higher. We should be unleashing American energy production\u2014not buying from countries like Venezuela. The countdown for the eclipse is underway. April southeastern Oklahoma will be in the path of totality. Be prepared for tourists and delays. On Monday, southeastern Oklahoma will be in the path of totality for the eclipse. Small towns could see upwards of people come to watch the eclipse. Please read below to get caught up on all you need to know. We\u2019ve had people that have been identified on the terror watchlist apprehended at our border in the last months. Our southern border is a national security crisis. Oklahoma\u2019s community banks & credit unions make sure our small businesses have access to capital to sustain & grow. I\u2019m pushing back on the Biden Admin\u2019s scheme to make their job more difficult Oklahoma\u2019s oil & gas industry helps provide power for the nation. I am pushing back against false attacks on American producers You can be pro-life and pro-IVF. I believe that every life is valuable\u2014born or unborn.

I\u2019m calling on the Biden Admin and Congress to fully evaluate China\u2019s predatory economic practices on our supply chain. Thousands of Special Interest Aliens have crossed our border\u2014however, the FBI and DHS cannot tell us how many. They have been released into the interior of the country and DHS has no idea where they are. This is a major risk to our national security. Special Interest Aliens are illegal border crossers who DHS has flagged as a potential risk to US national security. When asked if illegal border crossers are detained and deported\u2014DHS says \u201cnot all of them.\u201d This is a national security crisis. Good luck tonight, Lions! The abortion industry & Biden\u2019s FDA lies to women about DIY chemical abortions. The Biden Admin\u2019s extreme abortion agenda is putting moms and children at risk. Listen in to my conversation with ahead of the Supreme Court oral arguments tomorrow. Today, we recognize Medal of Honor Day\u2014a time to pause to recognize the bravery, dedication and valiant achievements of those who have been awarded this prestigious honor. Their efforts have helped shape our nation and have inspired generations. May God bless each of them and their families for the service and sacrifice they have made in defense of our great nation. While we await a decision from the Supreme Court on the legality of the deregulation of chemical abortions, I am continuing to prioritize policies that support moms and affirm the value of every child. The abortion industry lies to women. They\u2019ve told moms they need to choose between a child and a career. They\u2019ve said chemical abortions are as safe as Tylenol. These are lies. The pro-life movement is focused on the truth\u2014standing with every woman, for every child. My statement on why I opposed the funding bill Social Security \u201coverpayments\u201d happen when a beneficiary receives benefits after their death or an inflated, incorrect amount on their check. They are stressful because overpayments must be paid back in most cases. Here are some tips on what to do if you receive an overpayment. When someone at our border is declared a national security risk they should be detained, not released into the United States. I\u2019ve offered a simple amendment to the funding package: if someone is flagged as a national security risk, they should not be released into the country. Apparently my breakfast caused quite a stir yesterday. Glad we could celebrate the annual quail breakfast which shows the unique relationship w/our OK Delegation, the & \u2013the platinum standard for community-base relationships w/in the Air Force! Abortion pills aren\u2019t the same as contraceptive pills. The drugs used in a chemical abortion cause extreme pain and severe bleeding for the mother. They should not be mailed to women to be taken at home alone. It is unacceptable that the Biden Admin is empowering Venezuelan and Iranian oil & gas while punishing American producers. Americans shouldn\u2019t have to worry about how a government shutdown would impact airport TSA screenings. If my Prevent Government Shutdowns Act was signed into law, they wouldn\u2019t have to. The abortion industry has told moms that chemical abortions are as safe as Tylenol. In reality, they are as dangerous as a surgical abortion\u2014which are already dangerous for women and children. Great quail breakfast this morning! If the government shuts down this week, million men and women in our military could miss their next paycheck. This is unacceptable. It\u2019s beyond time to pass my Prevent Government Shutdowns Act. The surge of fentanyl into the US is hurting American families and communities\u2014we must solve the root causes of the flow of fentanyl into the US and work with our international allies to stop this crisis. I am passionate about the value of every single life. I am pro-life and pro-IVF. In the past year, the number of \u201cSpecial Interest Aliens,\u201d listed specifically as a national security risk, has grown into the tens of thousands. DHS has no idea the location of almost all of the Special Interest Aliens that were released into our country. This is a national security crisis. The Senate Republican Conference Vice Chair plays a vital role in serving Republican Senators and their staff as they communicate the conservative policy ideas that make our nation stronger. As Senators, we were elected to do hard things and to solve problems by doing the right thing, the right way. It is my desire to serve our Conference in every way I can as we work together to solve the challenges our nation faces. I will personally ask each of my colleagues for their support in the days ahead and look forward to discussing with them ways we can work together to serve the nation. The Biden Admin is NOT vetting or tracking illegal border crossers who pose a real risk to our national security. Myth: Chemical abortion is safe and effective Fact: The FDA has ignored the health risks chemical abortion drugs pose to women and babies. Myth: \u201cIt\u2019s as safe as taking Tylenol\u201d Fact: FDA has eliminated the reporting requirements when women experience extreme adverse effects Allowing women to take harmful, dangerous drugs without the presence of a doctor is not science. It\u2019s complete carelessness by the FDA. Women deserve better than the FDA\u2019s lack of restrictions on chemical abortion pills. ., & I sounded the alarm on our concerns of this program back in October. Read Happy Ag day!

Cindy and I are profoundly saddened by the loss of General Stafford, who served his hometown, state, and nation until his last day. He was an Air Force officer, pilot, astronaut, patriot, husband, father, and a man who never stopped serving his country. In he not only piloted Gemini VI\u2014he helped develop and prove the basic theory and practicality of space rendezvous\u2014a truly remarkable achievement for a boy from Weatherford. General Stafford leaves a legacy and an example to young Oklahomans of the American dream\u2014no matter who you are or where you start, if you work hard, you can achieve greatness in the United States. We will pray for his family as they grieve his passing. Congress must act now to reform PBMs so we can reduce the cost of Rx drugs prices. HHS is denying Oklahomans funding for increased access to cancer screenings and AIDs testing because of the Biden Admin\u2019s extreme abortion agenda. For OK families traveling out of the country for spring break\u2014make sure you have checked the Traveler\u2019s Checklist before you America stands with Israel! Laken Riley\u2019s painful story is another example of what faces every community & neighborhood in the US\u2014including of Biden\u2019s open border., & I are introducing The Laken Riley Act to call on ICE to deport illegal aliens who commit crimes Myth: Chemical abortion is safe and effective Fact: The FDA has ignored the health risks chemical abortion drugs pose to women and babies.

It\u2019s complete carelessness by the FDA. Women deserve better than the FDA\u2019s lack of safeguards on chemical abortion pills. Oklahoma is sadly aware of the impacts of wildfires. On February Oklahoma lost acres, homes, and people were injured. Federal gov\u2019t red tape can\u2019t be an excuse for a delayed response when disaster strikes.

The Biden Admin is putting abortion access before actual health care. The Chinese Communist Party shouldn\u2019t be in control of Americans\u2019 data or the information we see online.

The Far Left doesn\u2019t even want law abiding American citizens to have guns, but if you\u2019re here illegally it\u2019s ok. We need to secure our southern border and stop this madness now. Happy National Agriculture Day! I\u2019m proud to celebrate American farmers, ranchers, fishers, and foresters who feed, clothe and fuel our nation. Thank you for having me at Redstone Arsenal. The folks in Huntsville play such a critical role in the defense of our country. I\u2019ll always support them however I can. Contrary to what some people in Washington may tell you, it is possible to cut wasteful government spending while also bringing our tax dollars back home for public safety, health care, and infrastructure projects. Soon, more than million illegal immigrants will be living in the U.S. - nearly double Alabama\u2019s population. That\u2019s why I proudly voted to hold Biden accountable for his failed immigration policies. it\u2019s past time to take action. Close the border NOW!

I worked a shift Seats Incorporated in Spring Hill and spoke about my work to ensure we\u2019re making more goods in Kansas! People are frustrated by partisan gridlock. I\u2019m serving to bring a new generation of leadership to Washington. Getting out into the community and learning about folks\u2019 priorities is an incredibly important part of my job. That\u2019s why I visited the Johnson County Landfill this week to chat with local leaders about the only landfill that serves the growing county. Earlier this week, I got to visit a Head Start program in Ottawa and share my support for legislation that ensures Head Start staff are paid fairly and we can increase the number of childcare options in our communities.

I\u2019m looking forward to seeing them through the process! It's been years since the ACA changed lives, but extremist politicians still threaten to raise costs and cut coverage. While they\u2019re working to strip health care from families, I\u2019m working with folks at to strengthen ACA coverage and lower health care costs. Since coming to Congress, I fought to give Medicare the power to negotiate for cheaper prescription drug prices. We won that fight and now, Kansans will soon see lower prices when picking up their prescription at the pharmacy! Through my role on the U.S. House Small Business Committee, Kansas small businesses, including EverFit in Shawnee, will always have a champion for them in Congress. Today is the last day of and I\u2019m thinking about the time I got to serve lunch at a local elementary school! Ensuring our kids can access healthy meals is vital for their growth and success.

In the wake of antisemitism on too many college campuses, I\u2019m fighting to restore free speech. The Biden admin was *handed* the most secure border we\u2019ve seen. Their failure to enforce our immigration laws has completely undone all of that progress. Now, million border encounters have been recorded in less than years. EVs are a road to nowhere. Biden knows it, but still doubles down on his out-of-touch mandates. Regulations and red tape are crushing America\u2019s #smallbiz. I\u2019m working to ensure entrepreneurs get a fair shake \u2014 glad to see my Prove It Act gain momentum in ! The location of the COFA nations in the Indo-Pacific is critical to combatting China. By increasing our partnership with these islands through my CONVENE Act, the U.S. can better deter CCP aggression and keep Americans safe. President Biden has created this invasion on our southern border. But walls work \u2014 let\u2019s build it and finish it! No more abuse of taxpayer dollars at USAID. My bipartisan bill will bolster local partnerships, so developing countries reduce their dependence on U.S. dollars. Energy security is national security. That\u2019s why I\u2019m safeguarding our strategic supply of oil from benefitting our adversaries or CCP-controlled businesses. Growing up on my family farm in southwest Iowa, I understand the triumphs and challenges that come with being a woman in agriculture. I\u2019m proud to designate today as National Women in Ag Day \u2013 and have all the women of the Senate join me! Growing up, hunting was ingrained in me at an early age. As I work to support rights, preserve shooting sports for the next generation, and stop the Biden admin targeting the gun industry with my #FIREARMAct, I am proud to be recognized by ! Biden\u2019s ATF must stop bending the law to fit their gun-grabbing policies. It\u2019s time to end \u201cknock and talk\u201d without a warrant. Today, I\u2019ll be standing up for #smallbiz and demanding answers directly from . TUNE IN TO Great to have in DC during #IowaAgWeek! Thankful for all they do to invest in the people, progress, and pride of Iowa. Biden\u2019s EV mandate is a road to nowhere. His new rule forces Iowans to comply with his green agenda, wastes more taxpayer dollars, and makes us more reliant on China and slave labor. Enforcing the laws at our border keeps our country safe. I wish we had a President that agreed. Love to see Iowans supporting our communities this #IowaAgWeek! Happy to all of Iowa\u2019s farmers and producers. After Ecohealth funneled tax $ to the Wuhan Lab, it\u2019s clear they can\u2019t be trusted \u2014 with dollars or dangerous diseases. We must stop more taxpayer funds from being sent to Ecohealth before they are used to make the world a less safe place. #makeemsqueal As the top egg producing state in the nation, it\u2019s always #PoultryDay in Iowa!

I\u2019m calling on the Biden admin to reverse their trend of decline and increase #ag exports Biden\u2019s ATF has had it out for gun owners since day one, even preventing small businesses from making a living. My FIREARM Act supports law-abiding Iowa gun dealers, so they don\u2019t have to live in fear of their rights being stripped. We must bring American hostages home immediately. Qatar should come to the table and hold Hamas accountable. Every second counts. We need more FARM in the Farm Bill! Pass it on. #AgWeek China is on our shores, spying on critical military installations. They\u2019re in our backyard, buying up U.S. farmland. And the CCP has infiltrated millions of American lives through TikTok. We must take action to counter our adversary\u2019s influence in our homeland. Biden\u2019s budget proposal would add over trillion to the debt. Americans are already suffering from #Bidenflation, we shouldn\u2019t throw gas on the fire! I\u2019m proud to support the Laken Riley Act. There should be no more delay in the Senate. We must protect Americans from illegal immigrants \u2013 before we lose another life. Agriculture shapes our way of life in Iowa. This #AgWeek, I\u2019m grateful for all the farmers, ranchers, and producers who contribute so much to our economy and the world! Hamas needs to release American hostages immediately. Biden's open border is an open invitation for Iran-backed terrorists to infiltrate our homeland. This will only get worse until Biden secures the border. While unions fight tooth and nail to prevent bureaucrats from returning to the office, I\u2019m protecting taxpayer dollars from funding inefficient agency practices. Schumer should be focused on supporting Israel to defeat Hamas, instead of speaking words that play into the terrorists\u2019 hands. This #SunshineWeek, I shined a light on government waste by:Exposing the Biden admin\u2019s secret my oversight of inefficient teleworkHolding agencies accountable for bureaucrats\u2019 union activities on the clock And I\u2019m just getting started! #makeemsqueal No matter how he tries to spin it \u2014 Leader Schumer is dictating how and when another country\u2019s elections should be. He has turned his back on fully supporting Israel after one of the worst attacks in its history. As winter is coming to an end, it\u2019s #SunshineWeek! I\u2019m shining the light on government waste to save taxpayer $. Agreed \u2013 Biden\u2019s EV fantasy is a road to nowhere. Bureaucrats when they find out wants to double the number of hours they have to work every week. Biden\u2019s bureaucrats are working on behalf of themselves while secretly billing taxpayers for union activities. Every cent of Iowans' hard-earned tax dollars should be serving Iowans. Schumer should be ashamed for turning his back on our greatest ally in the Middle East. While he gives lip service to Israel, his statements today show he will follow in lockstep with terrorist sympathizers while American lives are on the line. Words have consequences. Chuck Schumer is more concerned with dictating Israel\u2019s elections than supporting our ally. So much for standing with the Jewish Community! This #SunshineWeek, I\u2019m shining a light on the Biden admin\u2019s secret spending. Unbelievable \u2014 the Biden admin is doubling down on putting billions into the hands of Iran and its terrorist proxies. Our is continuing to prioritize our adversaries over American lives. #Bidenflation is no joke. Since Biden took office, prices are skyrocketing across the board:Food is up over is up over is up over Chinese migrants are using CCP-backed TikTok to take advantage of Biden\u2019s open border and infiltrate the U.S. illegally. Our national security cannot be undermined any longer. It\u2019s a sorry state of affairs when most Americans fail to realize Hamas is holding our own citizens hostage. They need to get their facts straight and condemn Hamas. USAID tried to hide from me what it was doing with taxpayer dollars for months. Samantha Power should take a look in the mirror before pointing the finger at Israel. I\u2019m rooting for all the young Iowans participating in the upcoming Eastern Iowa Science and Engineering Fair. Their futures are bright! #Bidenflation is no joke.

I want to hear your story if you\u2019ve tried contacting a federal agency and got ghosted. #ghostbusters No more covering up for bureaucrats not showing up to work. Taxpayers deserve answers. I\u2019m demanding an expanded investigation into how \u2019s tele-\u201cwork\u201d is actually impacting its ability to serve farmers. Over Iowans joined and me for our Spring Break Reception today.

Read my farewell statement here: I have tried to represent you with decency, dignity and empathy. And we have done so much good together. There is no end to my appreciation for you and for this opportunity to serve. Seriously, when I started here, I couldn\u2019t imagine that on my final day in Congress, I would be in the White House and would say this. Thx, Mr. President. I hope I\u2019ve delivered for you all these years. We must stand with and for each other as we help rebuild our communities after the devastation of Hurricane Ian. I mourn the loss of life and property, and hope that recovery is swift. In an attempt to deflect from these ongoing protests, Iran has launched drones and missiles at Iraq, which have killed at least people - including a US citizen. These attacks also seriously threaten U.S. troops in Iraq and violate Iraq\u2019s sovereignty. I'm glad the U.S. moved swiftly to support the protestors in Iran, and I applaud the decision to issue a General License which will counter the Iranian regime's censorship and advance internet freedom and the free flow of information for the Iranian people. Powerful protests continue to spread across Iran as brave Iranians fight against their government's brutality & injustice. In response, Iranian security forces have violently cracked down on protests, incl by killing dozens, arresting thousands, & limiting access to the internet. Fentanyl related overdoses are rising & hurting young Americans. Protecting our youth, means working to find solutions that'll save lives. I'll be going live on IG w/ soon for a fentanyl day of action. Join here: Spent my time here fighting to ensure America remains the Land of Hope and Dreams. Here are the tunes I jammed to along the way. My last day in Congress\u2026 Praying for our fellow Floridians. Happy #RoshHashanah to all those celebrating! May the new year bring peace and joy to all. Shana Tovah! For the last time, I yield back. Mahsa Amini's death at the hands of the \"morality police\" is yet another egregious human rights violation committed by the Iranian regime. Brave Iranians, many of them women, are protesting this injustice across the country. Iran must allow women the freedoms they deserve. As says, the US stands with these protestors. I'm pleased the Administration sanctioned Iran's \"morality police\" & others involved in the violent suppression of the protests. More must be done to address the full scope of Iran's aggression and human rights violations. That\u2019s right, Chairman Nadler. And remember, there are progressive activists, progressive students, and progressive Members of Congress whose support of democratic Israel is fundamentally a part of their progressive values. They all belong at the table. We will not be silenced. Serving the people of Florida\u2019s Congressional district has been one of the greatest honors of my life. After terms in Congress, I will be delivering my last floor speech tonight at Tune in live at to watch. Our nation was founded by immigrants for those seeking refuge. We should be working to fix our immigration system. That starts w/ treating already vulnerable individuals fleeing repression w/ dignity & basic decency. Hezbollah is a terror proxy for Iran. It's time for the EU to join the US, Germany, Argentina, the Arab League & others in saying what Hezbollah openly admits - that it is one, unified terrorist organization. Today the House urged the EU to act. Watch my remarks below. million American women struggle with an eating disorder. Too often, they suffer in silence. This grant will invest nearly in early ED detection & prevention research for young women. This marks a step forward in bringing visibility to these \u201cinvisible illnesses.\" Yesterday, I met with former wrongful detainees, families of Americans who died while being held abroad, and families of Americans currently wrongfully detained abroad as part of the bipartisan task force on American hostages & wrongful detainees that I lead with . Yesterday marked the anniversary of the signing of the Abraham Accords & the beginning of a new geopolitical era in the Middle East. The Accords have unleashed an unparalleled amount of cooperation & ties between Israel & its regional partners - new and old. The Abraham Accords also ushered in a new and more hopeful era of friendship btwn Jews & Muslims in the Mid East and around the world. I look forward to continuing to strengthen & expand the Accords to realize our shared vision of a more prosperous, secure, and tolerant Mid East. This includes Iran. We must ensure the regime doesn't receive even from a nuclear agreement while Americans remain wrongfully held in Iran. I\u2019m glad met with the Griner & Whelan families today - he should meet w/every family of an American hostage or wrongful detainee. Passing the Levinson Act has been one of my proudest moments in Congress. The US must build on this & create a long-term strategy to prevent and deter the taking of hostages & wrongful detainees, incl. imposing financial costs on countries that engage in this egregious practice. \u201cIn the time it has taken you to read this op-ed, another American died of an overdose. Another American was shot.\u201d The gun violence & fentanyl crises speak to one enduring problem: the failure to act boldly. This one\u2019s for Eli. Read my : Always great to celebrate new historic investments in our communities w/ . The is life-changing legislation that will lower costs, dramatically reduce the deficit, create millions of jobs & deliver the most significant action on climate in history. Since the IAEA Board of Governors passed its censure resolution criticizing Iran's nuclear behavior in June, Iran has continued to rapidly advance its dangerous nuclear program, inhibit the IAEA's monitoring capabilities, and violate its safeguards obligations. The IAEA recently said that Iran has enough uranium that, if it were enriched further, could be used to build a nuclear weapon & that there has been no progress in resolving the IAEA's outstanding questions on nuclear material found at old but undeclared nuclear sites in Iran. Moreover, the IAEA said in a recent report that it could not guarantee that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was entirely peaceful. It\u2019s obvious Iran's nuclear program is a clear threat to global security & stability and undermines the international nuclear regime. The US rightly imposed additional sanctions on Iran for both cyberattacks & the production and transportation of drones to Russia for use in the war in Ukraine. We must continue to address all aspects of Iran's malign behavior, incl. its relationship w Russia. On our nation came together & showed resilience in the face of unimaginable terror. We must remain dedicated to honoring the memory of those lost & remembering the bravery of first responders who answered the call of duty during one of America\u2019s darkest moments. My heart goes out to the Royal Family and the British people. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will be remembered as a monumental figure, not just for the UK, but for world history. The international community, including the US, will mourn her loss. May her memory be a blessing. I recently traveled to Israel & the West Bank to meet with government and civil society leaders to discuss several critical issues, including countering Iran's malicious activities & strengthening regional coordination and cooperation. Here\u2019s more about my trip During meetings w/Israeli & Palestinian leaders, we discussed crucial steps to preserve the possibility of lasting peace through a solution, incl. ending terror payments, increasing economic opportunities for Palestinians, & building ties that #MEPPA fosters. I was so glad to reaffirm America's enduring bipartisan support for Israel and work to build a more peaceful, prosperous, and secure Middle East on my final Congressional delegation to Israel as the Chairman of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee. I also spoke with leaders and innovators from & to discuss how we can build upon Israel's thriving tech & startup ecosystem to address critical global problems, especially the threat posed by climate change, in direct coordination w/regional partners. As the US continues to confront Russia's illegal and unjust invasion of Ukraine AND consider a potential return to an Iran nuclear deal, we must examine how Russia and Iran cooperate to undermine the international rules-based order and advance their own malicious agendas. Finally, we must consider how a revived JCPOA can undermine our sanctions against Russia by giving Russia the opportunity to sell its oil through Iran. It's essential that our policy towards Russia and Iran are coordinated & aligned to advance US interests. Russia-Iran cooperation is evolving to encompass a larger and even more dangerous set of issues. As we continue to stand strongly with Ukraine, the JCPOA simply cannot be viewed independent of its likely benefits to Russia and Russia\u2019s ongoing war against Ukraine. Today marks Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day \u2013 exactly six months since Russia\u2019s illegal and unjust invasion began. The Ukrainian people are resilient & brave. I'm proud to stand in support of Ukraine and the Ukrainian peoples\u2019 fight to maintain its sovereignty and democracy. I'm pleased the Biden Administration announced an additional aid package worth nearly billion for Ukraine today. This reflects the United States' and the American peoples' long-term commitment to Ukraine's freedom, sovereignty, & continued independence. This year, an unprecedented number of Americans have passed away from fentanyl overdoses. This National Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Day, we must remember those that we\u2019ve lost and continue to spread awareness of the dangers of fentanyl and fentanyl contamination. Today is Siamak Namazi\u2019s day as an American hostage in Iran. This is unacceptable. Iran must free Siamak, his father Baquer Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, & Emad Shargi. We need to bring every American held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad home now. A lot has changed in the years since #SocialSecurity became law, but the of the program has not. Our community knows how important these benefits are. That\u2019s why I introduced legislation that will for the next generation. Happy Independence Day to India! The US-India strategic partnership is built upon our shared democratic values and interest in promoting security, stability, and economic prosperity. I look forward to continuing to strengthen this critical relationship. At least eight people, including five Americans, were injured in a shooting near the Western Wall in Jerusalem today. I condemn this awful act of terror & am praying for the victims' full and quick recovery. America stands with Israel now & always. For decades, Americans faced soaring prescription costs, struggled under the weight of the climate crisis, & watched prices balloon faster than pocketbooks as partisanship stifled innovation. Today, we took a key step to end that pattern by passing the They will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by by while lowering clean energy costs and creating clean energy jobs. The #IRA marks the single largest investment in climate action in our nation\u2019s history. They will reduce the deficit and fight inflation, while ensuring large corporations pay their fair share in taxes. The #IRA marks a major step toward a cleaner, safer, more prosperous future for every community. Read my statement here: I'm pleased the Pentagon maintained the requirement that the US Security Coordinator for Israel & the PA be a general, which strengthens the USSC's ability to promote security cooperation and stability between Israel & the PA and reflects the US' commitment to the region. Proud that and are committed to and prioritizing these Americans. I look forward to continuing to work w/ & the entire Biden Admin to bring home Austin Tice, Emad Shargi, Paul Whelan, and every American held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. Palestinian Islamic Jihad is a terrorist organization funded by Iran. They\u2019ve fired at least rockets at Israel tonight. And they\u2019re targeting civilians. America supports Iron Dome because it saves lives. We condemn these terror attacks. America stands with Israel. As attention remains focused on potential return to the JCPOA, we must acknowledge the scope of the Iranian regime's malicious behavior. Iran continues to spread terror & violence around the world, commit egregious human rights violations, & undermine the int'l rules-based order. Iran is rapidly advancing its nuclear program, recently said it has the capability to build a nuclear bomb, & continues to flout its safeguards obligations after IAEA BoG censure. This escalation destabilizes the Mid East & threatens the int'l nuclear movement. The US has worked w/ our allies & partners to lead a remarkably effective response to Russia's illegal and unjust invasion of Ukraine. The US must lead a similarly robust & comprehensive int'l effort to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program and the entirety of its malicious behavior. Horrified that Iran arrested several members of the Baha'i faith, incl. religious leaders, on charges of spying for Israel w/o offering evidence of illegal activity. These unjust detentions are part of Iran's state-sponsored persecution of religious minorities, incl. the Baha'i. This is devastating. Jackie served with distinction as RM of the Ethics Committee. I proudly served alongside her as Chair. She cared deeply about the House and about her constituents. My condolences to Jackie\u2019s family and staff and to the families of Emma and Zach as well. I urge the House to swiftly pass my resolution, H.Res which condemns Iran\u2019s persecution of Baha\u2019is and urges the President & Secretary of State to impose sanctions on Iranians directly responsible for serious human rights abuses, including abuses committed against Baha'is. Let\u2019s get this done! Today the House delivered a major statement to #EndGunViolence by passing the Assault Weapons Ban to ensure that assault weapons are kept out of our communities. Finally. But statements aren\u2019t enough. The Senate must act. million Americans rely on Social Security, & we need to pass common-sense legislation that both protects & bolsters it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to re-introduce introducing the Protecting & Preserving Social Security Act w/ Read more here: I was glad to join w/colleagues from the House & Senate Task Forces for Combating Antisemitism to welcome Biden Admin officials to Congress this morning. To all who came, especially & , thank you for your efforts to protect the global Jewish community. Our Ambassador is quite right. I look forward to working with her to address these outrageous comments. This is yet another piece of evidence that this open-ended COI process was unprecedented, biased, and unjustifiable from the start. The legacy of Nazis\u2019 antisemitism is real, dangerous, and poses a continued threat around the world today. Global leaders have a responsibility to recognize that and ensure the atrocities of the Holocaust are never repeated. Thank you, , for these important words. Iran\u2019s announcement today that it will not turn on the IAEA\u2019s monitoring cameras until a nuclear deal is revived is extremely worrying & underscores my deep concern about how any nuclear deal with Iran can be verifiable and enforceable. I echo 's condemnation of the Burma military regime's unjust execution of pro-democracy activists & elected leaders. I support the people of Burma in their efforts to restore democracy & pursue justice and accountability for the violence committed by Burma\u2019s military. Moreover, Iran also just declared that it will not answer the IAEA\u2019s outstanding questions about uranium particles found at undeclared nuclear sites in Iran, directly contradicting the censure resolution that was overwhelmingly passed by the IAEA Board of Governors last month. These announcements reflect Iran\u2019s dangerously escalatory nuclear behavior. I'm glad the US commitment to ensure that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon was strengthened by the Jerusalem Declaration & I urge continued action w/partners to ensure this commitment is realized. Proud to speak at an event with dedicated to the stories of employees persecuted by Nazi Germany & the deep Jewish history of the club. I\u2019ve been so glad to see FC Bayern embrace their Jewish roots and actively work to combat global antisemitism. Welcoming the new USS Fort Lauderdale to Fort Lauderdale! Welcoming the new U.S.S.

We paid tribute to the memory of the Four Little Girls who were killed within these sacred walls only decades ago. We must never forget their legacy. Today we kicked off our annual Pilgrimage in the Magic City and visited Regions Field to honor the role of baseball in the Civil Rights Movement. We are grateful to Rev. William Greason, a veteran, former Barons pitcher, and trailblazer for his words of wisdom! Women in Alabama deserve access to a FULL range of reproductive health care services and that includes IVF treatments. It is unthinkable that we would be fighting this fight in the year To conclude this I say the names of the Four Little Girls who lost their lives in the bombing of the Street Baptist Church\u2014Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley. May we never forget their names and their legacy. I joined \u2019 weekly press conference to shine a spotlight on the impact of the outrageous Alabama Supreme Court ruling on IVF. We will not stand by as MAGA extremists strip women of their reproductive freedom. We need to codify Roe v. Wade!! LIVE NOW: Tune in as I join \u2019 weekly press conference to discuss the impact of the Alabama Supreme Court ruling on IVF treatments. GREAT NEWS! The City of Birmingham was awarded from & to provide housing for veterans experiencing homelessness. We owe it to our veterans to ensure they receive the care and support they need here at home. This funding will be life-changing! Greensboro native Theresa Burroughs was a Bloody Sunday Foot Soldier, a warrior for justice, and head of the Safe House Museum in Hale County. Her leadership helped ensure that we never forget the role of the Safe House in the Civil Rights Movement. Delivered to help preserve the Historic Tabernacle Baptist Church in Selma! We must ensure that the legacy of this cherished Civil Rights landmark lives on for generations to come! We are thrilled that is investing million to repave almost blocks of roads in Selma! This will go a long way in helping us rebuild from the storms of January Proud to have helped secure this grant! The recent IVF ruling is already having devastating consequences for Alabama families who are simply trying to have children. My team welcomed to Birmingham to hear from Alabama women impacted. We are so grateful for their willingness to share their stories. NEWS: On Sunday we will welcome Kamala Harris back to my hometown of Selma to commemorate the anniversary of Bloody Sunday.

TRIO provides amazing opportunities to students who I fight for every day in Congress. I was so impressed by the student leaders I met & I know they\u2019ll make a difference in their communities! Today marks two years since Russia invaded Ukraine. It\u2019s time for to let the House vote on the Senate\u2019s national security bill so that the Ukrainian people get the tools they need to defend democracy. To cut off U.S. support would play right into Putin's hand!", "This is my last tweet from this account. It was an honor to serve the hardworking, resilient and caring people of Southern Minnesota in Congress. has a bright future because of you all. Thank you for the opportunity to serve you. On behalf of I am proud to release the Southern Minnesota Way of Life Report today. The report summarizes the constituent input my office and I heard over the last two years along our listening tour. Thanks to all who participated in our listening tour. The Southern Minnesota Way of Life Report and Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act would not have been possible without your invaluable insight and expertise. I am incredibly disappointed by the Republican Senator who blocked this bipartisan bill over supposed fiscal concerns. It is especially troubling to see this bill blocked when there is so much work left to do on toxic exposures as a whole, to include those exposed to burn pits and radiologically exposed veterans. Many of the Senators who spoke tonight in favor of the bill said that the only thing standing in the way of Blue Water Navy veterans receiving the benefits they earned was the U.S. Senate. They are right. Today we remember and pay tribute to the brave men and women who lost their lives years ago at Pearl Harbor. We will never forget their selfless courage or the sacrifices they made to protect our democracy and freedom around the world. Congrats to VA researchers Dr. McKee & Dr. Wyss-Coray on being named among TIME's most influential people in healthcare! Their work will help improve the lives of #veterans as well as the entire world's approach to treating brain injuries and memory loss. This is fundamentally unacceptable and is an affront to the freedoms our veterans put their lives on the line to defend. There is no room for racism in our VA, our government or our country. Period. My congressional offices are closed today to honor the life and service of President George H.W. Bush. On this National Day of Mourning, the hearts and condolences of a grateful nation go out to the entire Bush family. On Friday, I joined my Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to demanding clarity for the thousands of student veterans who\u2019ve been underpaid their #GIBill benefits. The lack of clarity coming from & is absolutely unacceptable. One day they\u2019re telling Congress they have no intention to retroactively repay these veterans, the next day they say they will. This obfuscation cannot go on. Our veterans deserve their #GIBill payments on time & in the amount they were promised. When VA fails to do this, then it\u2019s on VA to make veterans whole again. A veteran should never be forced to suffer as a result of a VA failure, that\u2019s why its on to make this right. I am deeply saddened to hear of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s passing. I will always be thankful for his patriotism & lifelong dedication to public service. To the entire Bush family, know a grateful nation is grieving with you during this difficult time. This is an unacceptable betrayal of our veterans. President Trump and Secretary Wilkie must do everything in their power to make these veterans whole again. My heart breaks for the three American soldiers killed in Ghazni. My sincere condolences go out to their families during this difficult time and they will be in my prayers. May the service and sacrifice of these brave soldiers never be forgotten. Our brave transgender troops are not a burden \u2014 they are American heroes. Their selfless service and sacrifice should be welcomed, honored and celebrated. This discriminatory ban weakens our national security and undercuts our national values. It must not stand. to our service members and their families, including and all our troops serving away from home this year. We are #thankful for your sacrifice. They have dedicated their careers to serving veterans and as a veteran myself I could not be more thankful. Serving as the Ranking Democrat on the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee has been an honor and a privilege. I could not be more proud of the work we\u2019ve accomplished to improve the lives of veterans and I know none of it would have been possible without my incredible staff. Honored to receive the Army Explosive Ordnance Order of Samuel Sharpe. Proud to support our EOD personnel around the world doing a very dangerous mission. Always an honor to salute our heroes together with dear friends at the Nicollet County #VeteransDay Dinner. We are all so grateful for your service. I appreciated the opportunity to address Richfield STEM Elementary School at their #VeteransDay Program Friday. Thank you to all who gathered together to honor our veterans and their families for all they have sacrificed for our nation. Proud to join my fellow Minnesotans this morning in Inver Grove Heights to honor our veterans at the State of Minnesota #VeteransDay Breakfast. We are forever in debt to those who have borne the battle. Today, we pause to honor the millions of #veterans who have served and sacrificed to defend this great nation and freedom around the world. To each and every one of you, thank you. #VeteransDay On behalf of it is my honor to introduce the Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act. This critical legislation will invest in the needs and longevity of Minnesota\u2019s small towns and empower local leaders to build up their communities \u2014 creating jobs in the process. The Pope is right. Health is a right, not a privilege. From increasing access to lowering costs, we have a lot of work ahead of us, and solidifying protections for folks with preexisting conditions is a critical part of moving forward. Earl Bakken was a true giant of medical technology whose work improved the health and lives of so many. My heart goes out to his entire family following his passing. This week, I led Members of Congress in sending a letter to Senator Isakson, Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, urging him to schedule a vote on the bipartisan Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, which passed the House in June. This bipartisan bill would grant nearly veterans who served off the coast of Vietnam & who suffer from illnesses resulting from their exposure to Agent Orange the benefits they deserve. These vets have waited years & time is running out. If the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is not signed into law before the end of this year, then our bipartisan work will be undone and these #veterans will be back to square one. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to bring this critical legislation to a vote. Our deepest condolences go out to the family of John Hoffmann and we continue to pray for the health of Kaleb Fischer. Our thoughts are with the loved-ones and all who have been impacted by these tragic accidents. When our country faces epidemics of veteran suicide and homelessness, the last thing we should do is take away billion from . Veterans should not get budget cuts after giving tax cuts to billionaires and corporations. Both parties are responsible for getting our fiscal house in order but the GOP\u2019s push to cut Medicare and Social Security in the name of fiscal responsibility \u2014 after having skyrocketed the deficit with tax cuts for the and corporations \u2014 is so wrong. Today, I introduced the Reserve Component Employer Incentive, Compensation, and Relief Act of alongside and . Our bipartisan bill incentivizes employers to hire and retain Guard members and reservists. Learn more: It was a pleasure to see my good friend Red Arndt at the Governor\u2019s Pheasant Opener over the weekend in Luverne. Thanks for your longtime advocacy for your community and the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System. Luverne and SW MN wouldn\u2019t be where it is today without you, Red. Congratulations to own Maple River East Elementary School in Minnesota Lake for being recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School! Your hard work goes to show the critical importance of investing in every single one of our students. Great to attend another Minnesota Governor\u2019s Pheasant Opener. Missed today in Luverne. Wishing him all the best in his recovery. Safe hunting, Gonna be a SPAMtastic MN Governor\u2019s Hunting Opener in Austin next year! Relieved to hear NASA astronaut Nick Hague is in good condition. Attacks on the press anywhere are attacks on the press everywhere. The apparent murder of Jamal Khashoggi constitutes a tragic violation of human rights. If a foreign person or country is determined responsible, Pres. Trump must impose sanctions to the fullest extent. Minnesota\u2019s farmers feed, fuel and clothe the world. Today, we thank you for everything you do. I\u2019ll keep advocating for a #FarmBill that works for all of our producers. Great work by for holding the Trump Admin accountable for unlawfully withholding documents that could reveal the extent of Mar-a-Lago's influence over VA. VA belongs to the millions of #veterans who served and sacrificed in uniform, not Trump's golfing buddies. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us but when it comes to turning the tide on the veteran suicide epidemic, we must never give up. Congress also needs to build upon the Clay Hunt SAV Act, a law I wrote to increase vets\u2019 access to mental health care, increase VA capacity to meet demand, improve quality of care, boost VA accountability, and develop a community support system for vets. I introduced the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act to authorize VA research into the efficacy of medicinal cannabis use by vets with PTSD and chronic pain. While no one solution will be enough, there are a number of steps we must take to move the ball forward in the fight to save the lives of our veterans. For one, Congress needs to pass my VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act. is a day to rededicate ourselves to caring for our own mental health and the mental health of others, including our nation\u2019s veterans living with PTSD and TBI. is a day to tear down the stigmas tied to mental illness and open our hearts and minds to our neighbors who live with mental health challenges. No one should have to fear opening up about a mental health condition because of how others might treat them. VA\u2019s refusal to cooperate with this inquiry is absolutely unacceptable. This issue has reeked of cronyism and corruption since the beginning and will remain a top concern until all our questions are answered. Trump & VA can\u2019t be allowed to sweep this under the rug. Thank you for your leadership and advocacy, . In telling Justin\u2019s story, you and your family are helping make a difference and I am honored to partner with you to fight the veteran suicide epidemic together. .@_ruralren understands the importance investing in our small town Minnesota communities. On behalf of the people of I\u2019m proud to sponsor a bill that does just that: the Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act. We stand with you, . PTSD and depression can affect anyone. There\u2019s no shame in seeking the help you need, in fact it\u2019s one of the bravest things you can do. One veteran lost to suicide is one too many. We still have a lot of work ahead of us and many questions to answer, but one thing is certain: we must never stop trying. We must never stop working together to make a difference. Our veterans deserve nothing less. The House VA Committee is convening a hearing on veteran suicide prevention today at a.m. CT. As Ranking Member of , I invite you to tune in to this critical discussion. The hearing will be streamed here: Honored to receive Fueling Growth Award from . I\u2019ll keep fighting for a strong RFS and renewable energy like ethanol. #HouseAg Committee roundtable on trade this morning in DC.

It\u2019s a privilege to continue advocating on behalf of Minnesota\u2019s family farmers, ranchers and small town communities alongside and . Together, we can get this #FarmBill done right. Toured the devastating storm damage in Morristown today with Fire Chief Troy Dahle and local leaders. The interagency collaboration and willingness of folks in towns across to help out their neighbors shows the strength of our communities. We will get through this together. The severe damage from storms last night in cities like Waterville is no match for the strength, unity and resiliency of our southern Minnesota communities. Together, we will recover. Thank you to law enforcement, first responders, utility workers, and all those in southern Minnesota helping out our communities following the devastating storms last night. We will rebuild and recover from this. Continuing to monitor reports following the severe storms tonight in southern Minnesota. My office is ready to assist in the recovery effort. The #FarmBill\u2019s working lands #conservation programs (CSP & EQIP) provide farmers & ranchers with the tools they need to grow food while protecting & enhancing water, soil & other critical natural resources. Read my op-ed on why we must protect them. My staff is back on the road to discuss my Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act at roundtables in all counties! Learn how the bill invests in the needs and longevity of Minnesota\u2019s small towns and empowers local leaders to create jobs: Last stop last week was our Nicollet County Roundtable in Nicollet. In Nicollet County, we heard from the City of Nicollet Mayor Fred Froehlich about how our Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act would help the area invest in economic development as well as a bike trail that will help attract young families to the city. Praying for the health of my friend . Glad to hear he is in good spirits and cracking jokes. I\u2019ll be thinking about him and today. In Freeborn County, Katie expressed how important it is for students to have access to reliable, high-speed internet. If it becomes law, our Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act could help our communities invest in broadband. My team went on to stop in Madelia for our Watonwan County Roundtable. As approaches, it is important for everyone in the storm's path to be prepared, listen to state and local officials, and remain aware of their surroundings. Helpful resources on hurricane preparedness can be found at We should be taking concrete, commonsense actions to slow and mitigate climate change. This takes us in the opposite direction. In Cottonwood County, Mountain Lake Mayor Mike Nelson said that our Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act would help the city invest in a waste water treatment facility as well as housing, child care and developing an industrial park. Thanks for your time, Mr. Mayor. At our Rock County Roundtable yesterday in Luverne, my team had a good conversation with local leaders about how my Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act will help Minnesota\u2019s small towns address today\u2019s challenges and thrive for decades to come. years since the attacks on we remember those who lost their lives, pay tribute to the first responders who ran selflessly into harm\u2019s way to save their neighbors, and salute the countless men and women who answered and continue to answer the call of duty. #NeverForget President Trump is fighting to block the extension of benefits for #BlueWaterNavy veterans. These #veterans have already waited years & it is past time we honor their sacrifice, even if we have to drag Trump along kicking & screaming to do it. Congratulations to Brett Reistad for being elected National Commander of The . I look forward to working very closely with him and his fellow Legionnaires so that we may continue to improve the lives of our nation's #veterans. It was a privilege to help assemble care packages for our military spouses today. Thank you for all you do for our country, #milspouses! #BeTheForce A #FarmBill that is in the best interests of both our farmers and the most vulnerable among us is not out of our reach if we are willing to find the common ground necessary to get it done. That is what I intend to do on this Conference Committee. No #FarmBill is perfect, but if we reject radical ideology and embrace bipartisanship, I am optimistic we can pass a meaningful Farm Bill that works for Minnesotans, beginning farmers, veterans hoping to start a career in agriculture, and our environment. It is an honor to advocate for Minnesota\u2019s farmers on the #FarmBill Conference Committee. I love this country, and serving our brave men and women in uniform is one of the greatest honors and of my lifetime. Thank you for your steadfast advocacy on behalf of our enlisted Guard members, . It is with great humility that I accept the Patriotism Award. It will serve as a reminder of the patriotic sacrifices our service members, veterans and their families make every day \u2014 and the hard work we still have ahead of us to care for them. Labor Day is more than a day off, it is about honoring the millions of Americans who are the backbone of our economy and our nation. This year, as Trump attacks labor rights across the US, our fight to ensure workers are treated w/ dignity and respect is more important than ever. Senator John McCain embodied what Americans ought to expect from our leaders: decency, civility, and respect. We are forever in his debt and it\u2019s up to us to carry on his legacy of patriotism. Our strength as Americans lies in our unity. Together, we stand strong. Divided, we fall. Senator McCain didn't just believe in this fundamental American truth, he lived it all the days of his life. Senator McCain understood that we are first and foremost Americans. During his memorial service today, that sentiment rang all throughout the Cathedral. While alone in the Capitol early this morning, I had the privilege to give one final salute to a close friend & mentor. The life of embodied the American spirit and I will be forever grateful for his service, sacrifice, and leadership. God speed my friend. So has no problem handing out tax cuts to billionaires and campaign donors but can\u2019t fairly compensate dedicated public servants, including world class VA doctors, for their hard work? Just plain wrong. In proud partnership with The , I will continue to do everything I can to advocate on behalf of our veterans as Ranking Member.", "A welcome early Christmas present for the West Slope! Good luck next season GJ Rockies! Thanksgiving is an important time to pause and show appreciation for the things that matter most. The opportunity to serve you and our country has been the greatest honor of my life. May God bless you and keep you and your family safe this holiday season. Post-COVID recovery for rural CO healthcare is hard. #PublicOption makes it even harder. Expensive, one size fits all, big government plan isn't what rural Coloradans need! Great column in the Sun today by the Colorado Business Roundtable\u2019s Debbie Brown: Today we honor and remember the lives of family members, friends and other heroes we lost years ago. #NeverForget rural hospitals have closed down since Here\u2019s a good column from Senator Ray Scott on the devastating impact that a \u201cpublic option\u201d healthcare system would have on rural Coloradans\u2019 access to care: Greatly welcomed grant relief available through to help extinguish the Grizzly Creek Fire. We are all incredibly thankful for the crews working and praying for the safety of the communities in the area. More on the grant announcement here: After years of tireless local advocacy and bipartisan collaboration, it\u2019s truly an honor to officially welcome BLMHQ to Colorado\u2019s Third District! It's been three months since the CARES Act was signed into law. We understood then just as we do now that there would be necessary changes and tweaks along the way, but already this critical legislation has helped and will continue to help millions of Americans battle I look forward to today's hearing to see how effective CARES Act has been (especially for rural communities) & how Congress & the Administration can continue to put political differences aside to remain focused on the dire issues at hand. Help the fire crews out by paying attention to local fire restrictions. This is important to do all year long, but especially in the summer months. Colorado\u2019s Third District is fortunate to have abundant public spaces for recreation and shared use, but given that many of these areas are non-taxable, a lack of tax revenue places significant budgetary constraints on rural areas. PILT plays a critical role to help these communities bridge budgetary challenges and I look forward to these funds being used to support essential infrastructure and services that would likely not exist without this money. Small Businesses on Main Street are the lifeblood of the Third District's economy. It's truly an honor to be recognized by the for my work to advance pro-growth policies that help Small I'm back in Washington this week to fight against a proposal that creates a clumsy database putting millions of American's personal information at risk and an effort to repeal a rule that provides real investments into rural communities. Western Slope farmers expect to lose around million worth of crops due to a late season freeze in April. I am glad the USDA listened to our calls to designate the impacted counties as disaster zones which makes temporary relief available for farmers. Thank you to all the fire suppression crews working around the clock to protect our communities! Great progress this weekend on the East Canyon Thank you @SecretarySonny for answering our calls to address a dire situation on the Western Slope. We all look forward to enjoying plenty of Colorado's famed Palisade Peaches next summer. The #CCP hid what it knew about the initial outbreak of and is now hiding information about its nuclear ambitions. The U.S. must reign in China through effective arms control. June is the beginning of fire season in Colorado and there are already several active fires. I will keep the following resource page available from my homepage with links to active fire maps, restrictions and federal relief options. Happy birthday to America\u2019s largest fighting force, and thank you to all Soldiers who have served in the Army over the last years. Too many youth have forgotten the horrors of the Holocaust and the sacrifices of those who helped liberate France during WWII. I'm honored to work with to reverse this trend and honor the special bond between the U.S. and France. The EPA's latest air report confirms that innovation, not overregulation leads to economic growth & a healthier environment. Policies like the Green New Deal are draconian, unnecessary & threaten the livelihoods of rural families. My full statement We are starting to see the results of the keeping employees paid & businesses open. We must remain diligent and use common sense to keep the most vulnerable safe, but this is great news as we start to reopen! America proudly supports the Chinese citizens who fight for their freedoms and we will continue to speak out against the abusive actions by the CCP and hold them accountable. June is and Great Sand Dunes National Park is expanding access for visitors. Be sure to recreate responsibly by following local health and safety guidelines and staying up to date on any fire restrictions. Economic recovery from is going to be dependent on maintaining existing jobs, such as the roughly steel jobs in CO's I will continue to fight for steel workers who are critical to our nation\u2019s infrastructure and national security. I join the country in disgust, anger, and sadness after seeing what happened to George Floyd. We all want to see justice for George Floyd and his family, and that is underway. It is critically important that all Americans regardless of color, creed or background feel safe in every community and are treated fairly under the law. Full statement here Great job and ! The future is bright as we enter a new chapter of America leading the world in space exploration once again. Incredibly proud of the community bank employees who have been putting in extra time to keep pace with the demand of PPP loans! I was glad to be in Washington today to cast my vote in support of the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act. This bill brings much-needed improvements to the program which has already helped over small businesses across CO. The right to practice one\u2019s own faith is paramount to a free people. The #CCP repeatedly violates this right by oppressing, imprisoning & killing its own citizens. The atrocities that this regime commits against Uyghurs & religious groups should be condemned by the entire world. For over years, #HongKong has been a reliable and trustworthy trading partner to counterbalance the #CCP's ruthless tactics towards the U.S. and our allies. China is making a devastating miscalculation that threatens the peace and prosperity of millions of Hong Kong citizens. Americans are doing everything they can to safely reopen their communities & Congress should do the same. Instead, Speaker Pelosi's proxy scheme encourages members to avoid working on critical issues & shrug off responsibility in a time of crisis. This is a dereliction of duty. For the first time in nearly a decade, will send two astronauts to the from American soil. We are incredibly proud of the men and women who continue seeking and reaching new frontiers! Today we remember the sacrifices made by those who have gone before us and given their lives so that our great nation can continue to be a model of liberty and freedom that inspires future generations of Americans and repressed people around the world. #MemorialDay Approximately good-paying jobs exist in Colorado's oil and gas industry but alongside Russia & Saudi Arabia flooding markets has threatened these workers and their families' livelihoods. It's critical ALL industries have access to lifelines to pay their employees. More on my efforts to fight for these jobs during this public health crisis here: Honored to be recognized as a Taxpayer Hero by the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste! I continue to fight for Coloradans to keep more of their hard-earned money and cut unnecessary red tape to promote economic growth! We all want to get out and enjoy our treasured open spaces and parks, but please if you choose to go out. This includes using best practices for social distancing and knowing any fire restrictions! Please check your local guidance before you head out. I am glad to see send an additional million economic impact payments using debit cards! Approx. of Coloradans don't have access to a bank account and this makes sure they aren't left out. . and I had urged the agency to do this in a letter last month. Americans will now have easier access to online shopping, avoid breaking safe or safer at home orders, among other benefits that debit cards offer. More on our work here So much for the state legislature's control of the purse strings. Glad to join and support this important legislation aimed to keep Chinese intelligence out of American government.", "China must uphold its commitment to \u201cOne Country, Two Systems.\u201d The people of the free world are with the people of Hong Kong who want nothing more than to enjoy the freedom they are promised.

Truly heartbreaking. In honor of We got Joey & Luna from a rescue in brother & sister. We lost Luna to cancer on Christmas Day. Such an amazing dog & so protective of our new baby girl. Full of love & loyalty, they deserve our utmost respect & care. Give your pet an extra hug. Debunking the Myths & Misconceptions about FISA There\u2019s been a lot of controversy and lies this week over the of FISA. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a former FBI agent and member of House Intel committee, and I lay out the facts in my podcast. Biden (or whoever is telling him what to say) should know better than to presume that Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran would abide by a ceasefire. They would merely rearm and plan to kill more Israelis. Let\u2019s not forget, there was a ceasefire on October - then Hamas broke it. With so much misinformation being spread as we debate intel collection reform that is essential to keeping America safe, \u2066\u2069 Chair Mike Turner & Rep Darin LaHood joined my podcast to describe how foreign intel actually works. Filing this one in the \u201cthings we already knew\u201d section. In my latest Coffee with Crenshaw, I discussed border security, combating Mexican drug cartels, the detrimental impacts of care on minors, and how DEI is promoting a toxic culture on college campuses. Watch here: Check out my latest podcast with Former Senator where we discuss American trade policy. We examine the history and evolution of trade policy, the debate over free trade vs protectionism, tariffs vs subsidies, and finding the right balance to create fair competition and the movement of goods between nations. We also discuss the prospects for the TikTok bill passing the Senate. Apple Podcasts: YouTube: In the they told us to cut up a cereal #solareclipse Once again, Biden is desperately trying to deceive voters with \u201cfree stuff\u201d he can\u2019t deliver on. His original student loan bailout was struck down by the Supreme Court- even some of his smaller student loan giveaways have run into legal obstacles. So why do this now? The timing suggests he hopes the Supreme Court won\u2019t have time to reject his plan before its term ends- giving voters the illusion that he is delivering for them. In reality, his plan will still be held up as the election approaches because of lower court challenges. Just the latest example of election gimmicks where they are blatantly trying to buy votes. Harvard will protect Hamas supporters but NOT Jewish students. They are just a joke at this point. Let\u2019s put this idea of a ceasefire into perspective. You want Israel to stop fighting against an enemy that has no intention of ever stopping. There was a ceasefire, Oct Then what happened on Oct The biggest massacre of Israelis in recent history. The rape of countless women. The burning of infants. The ruthless killing of civilians. War is ugly, but the blood of every civilian death is on Hamas. Not Israel. The demand is simple: Hamas must surrender totally & completely & allow a transition of power. Hamas can never have power again. If you care about Palestinian lives, that is what must happen. Childhood gender transition is not about the science. It\u2019s about radical ideology. \u201cAmerican medicine is no stranger to scandal\u2026What makes pediatric gender transition unique is that it has been framed as a nonnegotiable civil right and defended by powerful civil rights groups, the Democratic Party and their ideological allies in the mainstream media.\u201d We have a bad habit of relying on Mexico to fix our immigration problems. Whether it\u2019s Remain in Mexico or some other deal, it\u2019s not enough. We need to enforce our laws, fix the loopholes, and detain and deport instead of catch and release. It's about time. Sadly, it took a law to force them to do this. DEI bureaucracy creates a toxic campus culture, that's why I have federal legislation that will stop sending federal dollars to any university that requires DEI statements from students. Yet again, EPA is creating a costly 'solution' for a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. Why? Because the radical of this administration believe modern science and civilization are a scourge, not a benefit. Join me now for Coffee with Crenshaw. Wishing you and your family a Blessed Easter. For the holiest day in the Christian religion, Biden decides to make it Transgender Day. I thought this wasn\u2019t real when I read it, but it is. I will be celebrating Jesus and his resurrection this Easter. Biden can keep worshipping at the alter of wokeism. Good quote here from the Atlantic about blind loyalty to your \u201cteam.\u201d It has resulted in the mindless support of terrorists such as Hamas - and their brutal sexual violence - on college campuses nationwide. From the Atlantic: \u201cThe real story at Stanford is not about the You don\u2019t have to be able to name the river or the sea under discussion to chant \u201cFrom the river to the sea.\u201d This kind of obliviousness explains how one of my friends, a gay activist, can justify Hamas\u2019s actions, even though it would have the two of us\u2014 an outspoken queer person and a Jewish reporter\u2014killed in a heartbeat.\u201c Prayers to his wife Hadassah, their family, and their loved ones. AMLO's policies of \u201chugs not bullets\u201d are killing Americans and Mexicans alike and he wants to question our customs, traditions, and families. Let\u2019s get to the reality\u2026first of all, there\u2019s a rampant fentanyl and meth problem in Mexico. They just don\u2019t collect the data. Second of all, we aren\u2019t paying for anything not directly related to stopping illegal immigration. AMLO should instead be making demands on the cartels ravaging his own country. But he coddles them instead. The Mexican people and our people deserve better. Sign up now to join me and my special guest The Woodlands Township Director Brad Bailey for our upcoming Coffee with Crenshaw: Congressional Update \u2013 a virtual discussion on the current happenings in the House of UA CEO Scott\u2019s bad management, poor safety precautions, and unapologetic mistreatment of passengers is hurting United Airlines. I wish I had another option to fly to and from Washington, DC, but UA practically has a monopoly from Houston That needs to change. introducing legislation to create new passenger protections, including consumer safeguards for pets and service animals. Additionally, we are looking into granting Federal Trade Commission and State Attorney General oversight authorities to investigate passenger complaints. I encourage my colleagues to join me and co-sponsor this bill that will start prioritizing customers. EPA is once again trying to pick winners and losers through its tailpipe emissions rule for new vehicles. The Biden administration wants to force Americans to drive electric vehicles, with a goal of phasing out gas powered cars. EVs cost on average more than similarly sized internal combustion engine vehicles. For most people, a difference is VERY significant. Bottom line: this is a terrible rule, that boosts China\u2019s economy, dictates to American car buyers what they can and cannot drive, while doing almost nothing to actually reduce emissions. That is two-thirds of all sales being only electric or hybrid. And to make this even more insane, in only of new car sales were electric. The cost of electric vehicles are much to high for most car buyers. We just passed legislation out of the House that will separate TikTok from the CCP. You\u2018ve probably heard lies that this bill is a Trojan horse, or that it doesn\u2019t solve every problem on planet earth. The truth is, this bill just says that TikTok can\u2019t be owned by our enemies. I voted hell yes. The current owner of Tik Tok, ByteDance, is a Chinese company. They\u2019re bound by Chinese surveillance law to give American data to the CCP. And oh, by the way \u2014 the CCP even has board seat on ByteDance. Voting against this bill is a vote for the Chinese Communist Party. The opponents of this bill aren\u2019t defending free speech, they\u2019re defending Chinese access to American data and American minds. Not a good look. Instead of solving the many issues that are facing Americans, Biden chooses to yell about how Republicans hate women. Cool. Last week at the State of the Union, Biden incorrectly claimed that Republicans are trying to \u201ctake away women\u2019s rights.\u201d Clearly he\u2019s out of touch with his voters, because a majority of Americans support limits on abortion. NOT the \u201cabortion on demand\u201d policy that Biden loves to tout. Even in \u201cliberal Europe\u201d that Democrats love to praise, most abortion laws stop at weeks of pregnancy. I\u2019ll also add that the majority of Americans oppose abortion during the second and third trimester according to the latest Gallup polling. Look, data doesn\u2019t lie. Republicans are the reasonable ones here. Not Democrats. Last week we saw one of the most alarming examples of TikTok\u2019s manipulation in action. The committee unanimously approved a bill that would delist TikTok from app stores if ByteDance doesn\u2019t sell the company. If this is enacted, they will have days to sell. This isn\u2019t a ban, but this is a major way we can prevent the Chinese Communist Party from accessing millions of American\u2019s data. Just today TikTok prevented users from accessing the app unless you shared your zip code, prompting you to call your Congressman and repeat their lies. This is a massive information warfare campaign happening right before our eyes. This isn\u2019t old people being grumpy, or just \u201cnot getting it.\u201d The CCP is actively stealing American data. This has to stop now. Today the House passed the Laken Riley Act, a bill I was proud to cosponsor. It requires DHS to detain criminal aliens who have committed burglary, theft, larceny, and shoplifting. This is something they should have been doing already to protect Americans like Laken Riley, a old nursing student who was tragically murdered in broad daylight while jogging on her university campus. Laken was murdered by a criminal alien who had previously been arrested for endangering a child and shoplifting. He should have never been allowed into our country and he should have been deported long before he killed her.", "Come together for a Community Memorial Vigil to remember and pray for the family and friends of US Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, Zach Potts, and Emma Thomson. Tonight at at Jimtown High School East Side Parking Lot Dean Swihart, Jackie\u2019s husband, was just informed by the Elkhart County Sheriff\u2019s office that Jackie was killed in a car accident this afternoon. She has returned home to be with her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Please keep her family in your thoughts and prayers. During the Biden Recession, the last thing we need is more reckless, big-government spending that fuels inflation. The latest tax-and-spend scheme would send Americans deeper into Biden's economic crisis. Hoosiers can't afford the Schumer-Manchin tax hikes. Thanks to our amazing U.S. Armed Forces, the world is safer tonight. Countries like China & Mexico refuse to deter #fentanyl trafficking. Since President Biden & Democrats won't secure the border, Congress must pass my Civil Justice for Victims of International Fentanyl Trafficking Act to empower victims to seek justice. Banning firearms doesn\u2019t stop violence \u2013 it only punishes law-abiding gun owners. Tonight I voted to reject an outrageous overreach and defend Americans\u2019 Second Amendment freedoms enshrined by the U.S. Constitution. Armed with reckless spending and a big-government agenda, President Biden barreled into a recession and brought Hoosiers down with him. American families and workers are feeling the pain of this economy every single day. This is the Biden Recession. Thank you to the courageous men and women from Indiana and across the country who served our nation during the Korean War. Your service and sacrifice will never be forgotten. With interest rates on the rise, it will be harder than ever for Hoosier families to afford homes, cars, and other necessities. As President Biden and Democrats attempt to spend America deeper into inflation, we're in a dangerous and unsustainable cycle. Once again, Elkhart is Wonderful to see Elkhart recognized as an amazing place to live, work, and raise a family. As inflation skyrockets and families turn to food banks & other resources, we must tear down barriers to giving. My Food Donation Improvement Act will empower restaurants, grocery stores, and farms to offer safe food to their neighbors and defeat hunger - it's just common sense. The Democrats' student loan forgiveness schemes are welfare for the rich. Hardworking Hoosiers - like a welder who chose to pursue technical training - shouldn't be forced to bankroll the education of those who knowingly took on student debt. This is entitlement at its worst. As the border crisis continues to worsen, smugglers are taking advantage of the porous border to traffic poison into our communities. I've introduced legislation to empower victims and their families to hold fentanyl traffickers accountable & seek justice for this destruction. I\u2019m grateful to the courageous hero who took out the coward attacking innocent people in Greenwood, preventing additional tragedy. This selfless act of service amid the chaos demonstrates the best of the Hoosier spirit. House Democrats again voted to greenlight abortion at any time in pregnancy, anywhere in the country & bankrolled by taxpayers. Abortion on demand is an affront to pro-life values & our conscience protections. This radical agenda not only encourages - but celebrates - abortion. Pro-life leaders are keeping our eye on the target. As I told Washington Watch earlier this week, the extreme anti-life legislation we are considering today in the House is the Biden/Pelosi agenda to unravel pro-life protections. The U.S. warfighter must be equipped to confront century threats. This year's NDAA includes vital investments - including a nearly raise for our servicemembers - that will fortify our national defense. Read more: This week, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are pushing pro-abortion legislation to greenlight abortion anytime, anywhere, and on the taxpayers\u2019 dime \u2013 up until the point of birth. This anti-life agenda is radically out-of-touch with Americans\u2019 values. Skyrocketing prices are hammering Hoosiers. We can\u2019t afford much more of the cruel Biden Economy. #Bidenflation Inflation just hit Skyrocketing prices are hammering Hoosiers every day at the gas pump + the grocery store, on the job, and on the farm. This is the cruel reality of the Biden Economy. I\u2019ll keep rejecting Democrats\u2019 scheme to tax and spend Americans into a recession. As Co-Chair of the House Hunger Caucus, I am focused on combatting food insecurity in Indiana & beyond. It was an honor to visit the St. Vincent de Paul Society of St. Joseph County to learn how this dedicated team is serving Hoosiers & meeting needs in our community. With Roe relegated to history, President Biden is conspiring with extreme activists to push chemical abortion. These pills are the next frontier of a movement that celebrates abortion on-demand & funded by taxpayers. Women deserve to know the true costs & risks of abortion pills. St. Vincent de Paul of St. Joseph County is doing amazing work to serve Hoosiers in need. I was thrilled to join the team today as they received from to support their incredible Sweet Dreams Ministry - which is changing kids' lives. With illicit drugs flooding across the southern border, every town in America is a border town. My legislation, the Civil Justice for Victims of International Fentanyl Trafficking Act, will crack down on cartels and help victims seek justice. Today we celebrate nearly years of the inalienable right to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Thank you to the Americans who have served to protect our liberties and defend our homeland. Happy Fourth of July! The Biden White House spent months laughing off Americans' inflation fears. A year later, we're headed into the most expensive of July on record \u2013 higher than Doubling the R&D tax credit will encourage American companies \u2013 especially small biz and startups \u2013 to invest in growth that will drive prosperity. I introduced the FIRST Act to equip Americans to lead in century innovation. With illicit fentanyl coming across the southern border, Indiana has a death toll we shouldn\u2019t have. In the middle of the country, we're fighting this every day. I\u2019m urging President Biden to work with us to crack down on cartels and defend the American people from deadly drugs. With #Bidenflation, how much will you pay for your family's Fourth of July celebration? - lbs. of ground beef UP - lbs. of chicken UP - lbs. of homemade potato salad UP - hamburger buns UP - Half-gallon of vanilla ice cream UP The incentivizes the wicked cartels and traffickers who take advantage of the vulnerable to get rich. With lives on the line, we must end this dangerous crisis, secure the southern border, and get tough on the criminals who prey on families. The Supreme Court has rightfully upheld Coach Kennedy's right to pray on the line. Today is a big win for the U.S. Constitution and Americans' vital First Amendment freedoms. Threats & attacks on crisis pregnancy centers are indefensible. Every American should be appalled that radical activists have brazenly declared \"open season\" on pro-life organizations. I'm calling on to stop the violence and protect the rights of all Americans. Chemical abortion is the next frontier. Women deserve to know the truth about abortion pills & their risks. My legislation, the Safeguarding Women's and Children's Health Act, will strengthen transparency at the FDA and expose the true cost of these drugs. #DobbsvJackson Today is an answer to prayer. After nearly years, the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the inalienable right to life. As this mission moves to the states, our commitment to life will march on. Nearly every day, we hear that yet another young Hoosier has overdosed on illicit fentanyl that was trafficked across the southern border and into Michiana. Inaction isn't an option. We're fighting for the lives of our kids. I'm working to hold cartels & criminals accountable. Encouraged to see the U.S. Supreme Court uphold Americans' fundamental Second Amendment rights. Our right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. For years, #TitleIX has helped to safeguarded fair athletic opportunities for women & girls. Like many American women, I benefitted firsthand from growing up playing sports on girls' teams. Today, we must continue to protect the integrity of women's sports for our girls. Components of deadly fentanyl often are made in China assembled in Mexico and trafficked across the open southern border. My legislation would empower victims & their families to hold countries that refuse to stop cartels & traffickers accountable. I\u2019m thrilled to welcome Rep. Mayra Flores to Congress. It\u2019s a privilege to serve alongside her and the Conference as we work to deliver results for the American people. As I told , Hoosiers need energy stability & reliability this summer. Blackouts would be devastating for families, workers, and manufacturers. The Biden Administration must act NOW to prevent avoidable power outages this summer. Great to join today as this Hoosier company breaks ground on a new facility in Nappanee that will create jobs and strengthen our region\u2019s robust manufacturing industry. Congrats! On Juneteenth, Americans join together in marking the end of the scourge of slavery in our nation and the rightful restoration of freedom & justice for all. Happy Father\u2019s Day to all the Hoosier men who invest in families and help kids learn & grow. I\u2019m remembering my Dad today and thinking of all the way that fathers bless our community. We are so grateful for you! Every child should have the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. I introduced the Educational Choice for Children Act to empower parents, support kids, and ensure that Americans are equipped to lead in the century. Blackouts would be devastating for Hoosier families, workers & industry this summer. and I led the Indiana Republican Congressional Delegation in urging the Biden Admin to ramp up American-made energy to lower costs & restore stability. Inflation is a crisis for women in Indiana & beyond. As I told , women like Marshall Co. dairy farmer & entrepreneur Jill Houin and Elkhart Co. CEO Carol McDowell are feeling the pain of skyrocketing costs, supply chain shortages & workforce challenges every day. Our children\u2019s education is the key to America\u2019s future success. Offering education freedom to families will make a difference for millions. Proud to work with to lead on empowering parents & equipping kids to thrive. Skyrocketing prices for gas, groceries, and everyday necessities are hitting working families the hardest. To deliver relief for Hoosiers, we must ramp up American-made energy production and get big-government intervention out of the way of success. Resolving supply chain obstacles is a huge priority for farmers & manufacturers. Last night, the House passed the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act to increase transparency & expand export opportunities for Americans. Proud to co-sponsor the House version to provide relief. On #FlagDay and every day, I am so proud to fly the stars and stripes. Long may she wave over the land of the free and the home of the brave! My team joined a number of Hoosiers in Indy to honor women who have courageously served our nation. Thank you to , , and so many others for honoring our heroes on Women Veterans Recognition Day. Rampant pandemic unemployment insurance fraud cost American taxpayers billions. We must seek justice for taxpayers and hold these criminals accountable. Recently, I helped introduce the Chase COVID Unemployment Fraud Act of to expose fraud and recover stolen $$$. On Women Veterans Day, Americans celebrate and honor the brave women who have selflessly answered the call to serve our nation. We salute you! As summer heats up, #Bidenflation is burning Hoosiers. Skyrocketing costs are hitting everyone at the gas pump and the grocery store. With inflation at a NEW high, it's shaping up to be a painful summer for families, farmers, and workers. Congratulations to my friend, former Governor Mitch Daniels, on an incredible journey at the helm of Purdue University. As he prepares to retire later this year, he will leave an incredible legacy of service to Hoosiers and the community. Inflation is at a high. Gas is per gallon. This is real life in President Biden\u2019s America. The current #inflation crisis in America is a flat-out disgrace. The Biden White House can't blame this on anyone else. As I told today, the Administration must get serious about working with Republicans - and not against us - to lower inflation & energy costs. Gas is clocking in above per gallon across our communities. Hoosiers can\u2019t afford Biden\u2019s War on Energy. The clear solution - ramping up American-made energy to make our nation safer, stronger, and more prosperous. Today we honor and remember the courageous Americans who stormed the beaches of Normandy years ago. Their bravery and sacrifice on #DDay helped to defend freedom and uphold our fundamental values. They are truly the Greatest Generation, and we owe so much to them. Hoosiers don't need headlines to tell us gas prices have DOUBLED since President Biden took office - we are paying the price for Biden's War on Energy every single day. , energy independence is key to America's national security & prosperity. As liberals push unfettered access to chemical abortion, women deserve to know the truth about abortion pills & their side effects. My legislation, the Safeguarding Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health Act, will strengthen transparency at the FDA and expose the true cost of these drugs. Skyrocketing gas prices are taking a tangible toll on Hoosiers. From our local small businesses to our farmers and manufacturers, everyone is paying a big price for Joe Biden\u2019s War on Energy. Safe & accessible roads are key for economic growth. Today I expressed my concerns about 's proposed changes to US near Peru to Commissioner Michael Smith. I urged INDOT to protect the existing infrastructure that supports our vital industries. With gas at nearly Hoosier families are feeling pain at the pump and beyond. When we need them most, our vital farmers and truck drivers are getting crushed by out-of-control diesel costs. This summer, Americans will pay a steep cost for Joe Biden\u2019s War on Energy. Putin\u2019s unprovoked war on Ukraine has escalated the threat of food insecurity & #hunger across the globe. I am leading a bipartisan solution to cut red tape, lower costs, and help get food into the hands of people in need. Read more: On #MemorialDay, Americans remember & honor the courageous men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. We are indebted to these heroes \u2013 and their families \u2013 for this selfless service. Freedom isn\u2019t free. After working with the Chinese Communist Party to cover-up the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the WHO has utterly failed Americans & people across the world. Given its untrustworthy track record, the WHO must not be given any further power. I\u2019m thrilled to announce that Elkhart & Western Railroad Company has received a million grant to invest in our community with modernization and safety improvements. This project will support future growth & eliminate traffic delays. As we learn more about today's senseless attack in Uvalde, Texas, I am devastated for the children, families, and community members who are grieving. Violence has no place in our nation's schools - or anywhere else. We must work together to protect our kids. I'm glad to see the Indiana General Assembly act to protect the integrity of girls\u2019 sports. As a young Hoosier growing up in Northern Indiana, I experienced firsthand the benefits of girls\u2019 sports. We must continue to protect these athletic opportunities for girls and women. The ongoing baby formula shortage is a terrifying crisis for American moms and families. I co-sponsored the Babies Need Formula Now Act to address President Biden\u2019s dangerous formula crisis and help get formula into the hands of parents. To the brave men and women who have answered the call to serve our nation, THANK YOU! Our grateful nation is indebted to you. As inflation continues to skyrocket, more seniors are heading back to work to make ends meet. My Senior Citizens\u2019 Freedom to Work Act would end the burdensome penalty on seniors who keep working or return to work after claiming Social Security benefits. On day one, President Biden canceled the Keystone Pipeline and began his all-out war on American-made energy. While Hoosiers face record-high fuel prices, the Democrats want delusional Green New Deal pipe dreams instead of pipelines that would cut costs for families & workers. Relieved to hear reports that the Biden Admin is giving up on its Disinformation Governance Board after we sounded the alarm. I helped introduce legislation that would prevent any taxpayer support for this or similar efforts that would endanger Americans' First Amendment rights. Every day, I am hearing from Hoosier moms who are struggling to find the formula her child needs. I will continue calling on President Biden and his team to get serious about overcoming obstacles that prevent formula from reaching parents. The Biden Blame Game is unacceptable. Grateful to partner with former First Lady to serve American foster kids and families. In case you missed it, read our column on Fostering a Brighter Future here: As Hoosiers face record-high prices at the pump, it is unbelievable that President Biden is canceling oil and gas leases. We need MORE American-made energy - not less. This is Biden's War on Energy. Great to meet this week with South Bend Councilman Henry Davis Jr. and other community members at Beck's Lake about protecting our community and the wellbeing of Hoosiers. At a local grocery store last weekend, a chicken cost a whopping Skyrocketing #inflation is a disaster for every Hoosier family - and especially for our seniors. We must end big-government intervention, prioritize American-made energy, and get ports working overtime. The persistent formula shortage is a terrifying crisis for families across America. I'm calling on President Biden and the FDA to take immediate action to jump start production and get formula into the hands of parents. This is a matter of life and death. Thanks to hardworking Hoosiers, Elkhart has overcome challenges to grow and thrive. Great to have CEO Levon Johnson testify at today to showcase our outstanding workforce and local industry. Today's Senate vote to greenlight Abortion On Demand - up until the moment of birth and bankrolled by taxpayers - is a national disgrace. The heartbeat of America is for life. I will always stand for the protection of the vulnerable. #prolife As we kick off I am so grateful to Mishawaka Police Chief Ken Witkowski and all of the law enforcement officers across Michiana who put their lives on the line to serve and protect our communities. Today and every day, thank you. Illicit fentanyl - which often originates in China and then is trafficked across the southern border - is a dangerous & deadly threat. We must secure the border, get tough on drug cartels, and equip communities to protect Americans. Biden's Blame Game does nothing to help Hoosiers. Let's look at what President Biden has done. Fueled #inflation with big-government spending Killed American-made energy production Paid American workers to stay home Laughed off inflation & supply chain bottlenecks Every Hoosier veteran must get the quality care & support they deserve. I\u2019m calling on Sec. McDonough to provide improved long-term care solutions for veterans in Indiana and across the country. I teamed up with former First Lady to write a Fox News op-ed on our efforts to support kids in the foster care system & help them succeed. It was great to kick off the with my friends at WFRN as we pray for our community and our nation. \u201cDevote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.\u201c Colossians Children entrusted to the foster care system are searching for direction, answers, and hope - and America must deliver. Former First Lady and I are focused on supporting kids & equipping them to thrive. Read more in our new op-ed. Overturning Roe v. Wade would be an answer to prayer - but the court must speak for itself without facing intimidation or threats from extreme liberals with a clear agenda. This leak once again proves the left will stoop to unprecedented lows to extinguish the right to life. Great to see Kassi Tom-Rowland of Tom Farms in Leesburg at the Capitol recently. We had a good conversation about our region\u2019s robust agriculture community and its vital work to feed and fuel Americans. When testified on President Biden's budget yesterday, I grilled him for answers on Hoosier priorities - from chaos on the border to the drug crisis killing Hoosiers. Watch our full discussion here. I am appalled by the Biden plans to create a so-called \"Disinformation Governance Board\" and limit free speech. As our nation faces threats at home and abroad, should be focused on defending Americans - not trampling on our Constitutional rights. It's a true privilege to honor and thank Hoosier veterans for their service to our nation. We must never forget that this is the home of the free because of the brave. I'm grateful to #HonorFlight Northeast Indiana for recognizing our selfless heroes & leading today's visit. Thanks to our incredible Hoosier workforce, Northern Indiana is an economic powerhouse. Great to see the Wall Street Journal recognize Elkhart as an amazing place to work and build a business. After the White House spent months laughing off inflation, the #Bidenflation numbers speak for themselves. Gas is UP Beef is UP Bacon is UP Chicken is UP Ham is UP Butter is UP Milk is UP Eggs are UP Baby food is UP As Putin continues his war on Ukraine, the world is facing a perfect storm that could lead to widespread food insecurity. The House Hunger Caucus recently held a discussion with experts on solutions to end hunger & address potential shortages. Watch here: It was a privilege to join ATC and R. Yoder Construction for the groundbreaking of a new HQ & production facility in Nappanee. This investment in our community is a testament to our unmatched workforce \u2013 and it will drive job creation and economic growth. President Joe Biden and the Democrats are inviting chaos and danger on the southern border. More than migrants crossed the border per day last month alone. That\u2019s a whopping increase from", "It\u2019s been just over months into the Congress. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ve been hard at work serving the constituents of Florida\u2019s Congressional district Safeguarding American citizen\u2019s personal liberties is one of my priorities. While I\u2019m very disappointed that the amendment I supported requiring the FBI to get a warrant failed due to a tie vote, today\u2019s bill includes numerous reforms that ends FISA as we\u2019ve known it. Most importantly, this bill sunsets FISA in two years, and I\u2019m confident that under a Trump Administration further reforms to this program can be made to protect American\u2019s civil liberties. My friend with a good explanation of what yesterday\u2019s vote was - and wasn\u2019t. I agree with This Instability in Haiti poses a real risk of mass illegal migration. That\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting to ensure we have the resources needed to protect Florida\u2019s shores. Cargo activity at U.S. ports is critical to our nation\u2019s commerce\u2026we must make the necessary investments and ensure our ports can effectively confront physical and cyber-threats. Tune in to our hearing on this topic Very sad news. Saying a prayer for and family tonight. Happy Easter for He is Risen! Sandy and I are blessed to be with our children and grandchildren celebrating God\u2019s love and sacrifice. From my family to yours, Happy Easter. Today we are reminded of the heroism of those who served in the Vietnam War, and express gratitude for those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country. This Vietnam War Veterans Day, we honor and thank our Vietnam Veterans. We owe you a debt we can never repay. \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.\u201d \u2013 John Wishing you and your family a blessed Good Friday. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. My office continues to monitor the situation, and I extend my gratitude to the brave first responders and members as they work tirelessly continuing their rescue mission. Today on National Medal of Honor Day, we recognize the heroism and bravery of America\u2019s Medal of Honor Recipients. Our freedoms are preserved thanks to their service and sacrifice. We owe them a debt we can never repay. Today I voted for H.R. which repeals the EPA\u2019s green bank slush fund, and proposed natural gas tax. This bill ensures that US taxpayer dollars are not being spent on Democrats' radical climate agenda, and supports the production of reliable, affordable, American energy. I ran for office pledging to do my part to slow the spigot of spending. While today\u2019s spending bill funds some conservative priorities, I cannot support this bill as it spends excessive taxpayer dollars on non-critical programs and policies. Securing the border is one of my top priorities and I owe it to my constituents to vote against legislation that lets President Biden spend more taxpayer dollars on his senseless immigration policies. I just voted to pass 's Creating Confidence in Clean Water Permitting Act. This bill streamlines the CWA permitting process allowing critical energy and infrastructure projects to be completed in an efficient and timely manner. This is the result of President Biden\u2019s failed border policies. Make no mistake, if was in office he would have signed my Finish the Wall Act. Today I voted to fight back against President Biden\u2019s anti-American energy policies by passing and H.R. These two bills will help unleash American energy production and end Biden\u2019s crusade on American energy. Today, approved the Coast guard Reauthorization Act of legislation that was developed by my committee. The investments authorized in this bill are important to ensure border security - especially given the increase in interdiction and repatriations of those illegally attempting to land on Florida shores. It also helps the turn the tide on recruiting challenges and provide the resources needed for the service to carry out their critical missions. In the recent appropriations bill passed by congress, I fought to secure funding for to purchase a RAPID DNA system that will help identify suspects and reduce crime lab backlogs countywide. I will continue to fight for our police. The Supreme Court will let Texas enforce a state law that allows law enforcement to arrest and deport illegal immigrants. Texas state leaders are stepping up to defend their borders against the Today is National Agriculture Day! As one of the three pillars to our state\u2019s economy, Florida\u2019s agricultural industry supports jobs, provides families with financial security, and builds resilient communities. Today, , , and I sent a letter urging Biden to use his presidential authority to issue a declaration allowing the U.S. Navy to assist efforts in combatting an anticipated influx of illegal immigration from Haiti. You\u2019re the best! Thanks for helping me get constituents home! In the recent budget I voted to pass, secured important provisions that prohibit Biden\u2019s DOJ from targeting or investigating parents and churches for exercising their First Amendment rights. I will always fight to protect the rights and liberties of Americans. Thank you . I\u2019ve also reached out to to ensure they have plans and resources in place to combat an anticipated influx of illegal immigration from Haiti. Legislation developed by my committee last year would increase Coast Guard resources. I have and will always support our police. The recent appropriations package which I voted to pass recently provides the tools and resources necessary to keep our communities safe. Applications like TikTok that are owned by foreign government adversaries pose a serious national security threat. Through the collection of a concerning amount of user data, applications like TikTok are able to surveil and manipulate users. That's why I voted to pass H.R. This bill takes a targeted and narrow approach, only applying to companies owned by a foreign adversary\u2019s government (China, North Korea, Russia, or Iran) that pose a serious national security threat. This thoughtful approach will protect Americans privacy and ensure that bad actors like the Communist Party of China are unable to collect data and spy on American citizens. Still have questions ahead of today\u2019s vote? Read this For too long, veterans receiving help with their VA benefits forfeited their rights. Thankfully, a provision in the appropriations package I voted to pass last week protects veterans constitutional rights to keep and bear arms. The message from tonight\u2019s State of the Union is clear. The American people cannot afford more years of the Biden Administration. Mr. President, if you're serious about securing the border you can shut down the border TODAY and resume construction of 's border wall. Don't let President Biden fool you. Under his Administration, hardworking home buyers are punished for making responsible financial decisions. That's why I voted to pass the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act to reverse his unfair rule. Rather than address the crisis at our nations borders, Biden opened his speech talking about Europe's. Bidenomics has failed the American people. Record inflation and reckless spending has led to the rise in cost of basic goods, services and groceries. The American people need relief. If President Biden want's a great American comeback, he would return to the policies of the Administration. Tonight, President Biden will deliver his State of the Union address.

It was an honor to speak at the Harvard-MIT Technology and National Security Conference this weekend. We must ensure that our military builds unmanned aircraft capabilities at the speed of relevance. While chairing a subcommittee hearing today, I questioned officials on their plans to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies. Ensuring our Armed Forces and allies have an indispensable munitions producer is key to maintaining military preparedness at home and abroad. It was great to tour the Radford Army Ammunition Plant to see firsthand their work to support our national defense. As vice chairman of , it was great to see \u2019s cutting-edge technology in metal manufacturing. Their process is being rapidly incorporated into national defense projects and provides stronger, higher quality parts than traditional manufacturing practices. BWX Technologies provides key components to for submarines and aircraft carriers and plays a crucial role in U.S. naval power. During my visit to , I saw firsthand how critical it is that we maintain stable funding for aircraft carrier and submarine production. As vice chairman of and alumnus of , it was great to learn more about my alma mater\u2019s research initiatives into unmanned systems, which are taking an increasingly prominent role in our national defense strategy. Thanks for hosting me! #GoHokies The Commonwealth is home to a diverse array of wildlife, including the striped bass and northern cardinal. As a lifelong fisherman, hunter, and outdoorsman, I\u2019m taking time on this to appreciate the plants and animals that also call Virginia home.

It was great to meet with this afternoon to discuss ways Congress can continue to support their conservation efforts. The newly proposed BIDEH rule will drastically alter management of the National Wildlife Refuge System, yet is only allowing a brief, comment period. Read my letter urging USFWS to extend this period to allow those who will be impacted to voice their concerns", "Last Thursday, I joined for a fireside chat about the normalization of impeachment at . To buck this trend, I encourage the next generation of leaders to go out and talk to people that they don\u2019t agree with. Thank you, , for hosting!

I look forward to inspiring the next generation of political leaders. View announcement here: Haven\u2019t been on social media in awhile, but this is a great time to start anew.Thank you Bucket List It\u2019s hard to sum up the lessons I\u2019ve learned during my decades of service, so instead, I\u2019d like to say thank you. Thank you to the District of Illinois for allowing me to represent you for the last years. It has been the honor of my lifetime. Just awful news. Scott Bennett was a good man and respected by all who knew him. He truly cared about his community and our state. My heart breaks for his wife and children. Shannon and I are praying for them and the entire Bennett family. Sad to hear of the passing of my friend and colleague, @RepMcEachin. Cancer is a terrible disease. Donald's fight against it is an inspiration to all who have to go through it. Shannon and I are praying for the entire McEachin family and also his Congressional staff. Kids, you shouldn\u2019t gamble. I bet my buddy and now have to wear this goofy hat. Go Braves\u2026next year! I'll be participating in 's election night political panel tomorrow evening to discuss the General Election. Tune in if you are interested! An attack on any member's family is an attack on all of Congress. Shannon and I are praying for a speedy recovery for Paul and comfort for the Pelosi family. It's incumbent upon all of us to condemn this attack and do everything we can to end all violence. Yesterday we visited Blue Mound, Assumption, Nokomis, and Carrollton to highlight Community Project Funding grants our office requested. These grants will bring our tax dollars back home to help these communities improve their water treatment services for local families. You can learn more about our office's Community Project Funding requests, all of which were successfully awarded, by visiting: I spoke with Mayor Moore-Wolfe this morning to get an update on the condition of the two injured Decatur officers. I'm glad to hear the officers are in stable condition. This tragic shooting shows the dangers our brave men and women in law enforcement face every day. Please pray for a speedy recovery for the officers and their families. Particularly in times like these, we should stand with the law enforcement community because they put their own safety on the line to keep us all safe. Thank you to , , , , , , , , and for signing! Thank you to and for being our first bipartisan signers! This morning I filed a discharge petition with & to force a vote on our Social Security Fairness Act. Police officers, firefighters, & other public servants deserve relief from unfair provisions in the Social Security code. Enjoyed meeting up with earlier this week. I'm proud to receive their \"Legislator of the Year\" award for our work on behalf of soybean growers. Ag is critically important to the economy & rural America. It's an honor to represent farmers & producers in Congress. This morning I visited the B-N area to highlight Community Project Funding our office requested for 's Family Health Center. The funding Chestnut's Family Health Center is receiving will assist them in construction and renovation of their dental clinic. I'm proud to support Federally Qualified Health Centers like Chestnut. They are vital to providing health care to residents in our communities. Special thanks to Dave, Puneet, and Lori at Chestnut for hosting. I\u2019m disappointed the Ways & Means Committee held a hearing for the sole purpose of obstructing our bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act, which is co-sponsored by a supermajority of the House, from receiving a floor vote through the Consensus Calendar process. The leadership of the Democrat Majority can spend trillions of $ on their pet projects and political agenda, yet they have so far refused to even allow a vote on restoring Social Security benefits for public service workers like police officers and firefighters. That\u2019s shameful. I\u2019ll continue to push for a vote on our common-sense bill and remind the public that Dem leadership has it in their power to allow a vote at any time. The millions of public service workers across this country who are being unfairly punished by the Social Security Act deserve it. RIP my sweet little girl. Juliet crossed the Rainbow Bridge this morning. Thank you for giving us such joy and love for years. Mom, Dad, Big Sis, the Brothers, Ryder and Sadie will miss you soooo much. Next week is For the first time ever under House Rules, the language of HR our bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act, could be voted on in the House, but it's up to Speaker Pelosi and House leadership. We need a years ago today, nearly Americans lost their lives in the worst terrorist attack on our soil. We honor their memories, and we will #NeverForget. May God bless the victims of our first responders, their families, and the United States of America. This week, we highlighted four Community Project Funding grants our office requested for Willard Airport, the Piatt County Nursing Home, Millikin University, and the City of Gillespie. These grants bring our tax dollars back to our communities and help address local needs. These four requests from our office helped local communities procure: Screening checkpoint improvements at Willard An emergency power system upgrade at the Piatt County Nursing Home A new nursing facility at Millikin Improvements to the downtown Gillespie streetscape You can learn more about our office's Community Project Funding requests, all of which were successfully awarded, here: You can also view our requests, which have yet to be awarded, as well. Happy Labor Day, Illinois! Working men and women built the USA, making it the greatest country in the history of the world. I'm proud to advocate for middle class, working families in Congress. God bless America and the American worker! Enjoyed touring the 's National Centers for Animal Health in Ames, Iowa, with colleagues yesterday. The work done here is critical for the livestock industry. Also enjoyed talking with local FFA students. These impressive young individuals are our future leaders. Congrats to the winner, although perm\u2019s a little too elevated for my style. Best wishes that he too may get a date with his future wife like I did when fully mulleted. Don\u2019t screw it up! I hear he can play baseball too!! Shannon and I are heartbroken by the passing of my good friend and classmate, Jackie Walorski, and two members of her staff. Jackie was a great advocate for her constituents, a strong leader of the Ethics committee, and deeply loved and respected by her colleagues. Her passing is a huge loss for her district and the House of We are praying for her entire family, especially her husband Dean, her staff, and the family and friends of the staffers who passed away in the accident. I joined Christian Co. Sheriff Kettelkamp, State Rep. Bourne & Assumption leaders & residents to call for safety improvements at the intersection of US & Leafland following the tragic accident that took the lives of two local teens & injured two others. Governor Pritzker and officials at IDOT have the resources and authority to make changes to increase safety at the intersection now. They must act. Families deserve safety. . and I have a bill to correct this injustice - H.R. Today we secured a victory for the when House Leadership reversed their Rule to stop H.R. from receiving a vote on the floor. We are one step closer to our vote in September to protect the benefits of millions of hard-working Americans. A little sore squatting today, but so thankful for the Republican and Democrat teams for the signed shin guards and so honored to have my friend give me the game ending baseball at the mound last night. Democrats refuse to admit that our economy is heading in the wrong direction. They are trying to redefine the definition of \"recession\" in an attempt to cover up their massive policy failures. One-party, Democrat rule in Washington has been a disaster for American families. We just received cosponsors on our bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act, allowing us to force a floor vote, but Speaker Pelosi is pursuing a rule change that would kill our bill. This is outrageous. Our police, firefighters, and public service employees deserve better. @IAFFNewsDesk @RepElaineLuria @RepDavidEPrice @RepJohnYarmuth @RepSires Happy birthday to my lovely wife Shannon! The kids and I love you so much. Enjoyed being with the this morning. We talked about promoting civility in politics and working together to get things done, which is made easier with the help of ice-cold, American-made beer. Proud to advocate for our beer industry and its workers in Congress. Clearly it\u2019s not been a good summer for us We secured cosponsors of my Social Security Fairness Act, which repeals parts of Social Security that penalize public employees like police officers and firefighters. I filed a motion to place our bill on the Consensus Calendar. It's now up to Speaker Pelosi to call a vote. Happy Independence Day! May God continue to bless the greatest nation in the history of the world, the United States of America. President Biden just signed an gun control bill into law this morning. I voted No on this bill yesterday. We don\u2019t need more laws and restrictions that make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to exercise their Constitutional rights and protect their families. Proud to stand with my colleagues today as we mark this important victory for Life and the unborn in the United States of America. Today and every day, I'm proud to be #ProLife.", "Visited folks from with my friend to hear more about their work to bolster ethanol and biodiesel production in Iowa and across the Midwest. Iowa biofuels can make our country energy independent again, lower gas prices, and support our rural economy. China must be banned from buying our farmland because American farmland belongs to American farmers \u2014 period. The long-term success of American agriculture depends on robust access to new and developing markets. That's why we must actively work to open new export markets for our farmers and producers and eliminate trade barriers that prevent our goods from reaching foreign markets. The death tax makes it too hard for our producers to pass their farms on to the next generation. It\u2019s unacceptable. That\u2019s why I\u2019m leading legislation to permanently REPEAL the death tax so that we can lower taxes for our farmers and keep our farmland in American hands. Education is a crucial investment in our kids and our rural communities. That\u2019s why I introduced legislation to fully fund the Agriculture in the Classroom program, which supports ag education initiatives for students and teachers in Iowa. Republicans voted to secure our border, finish the wall, and fully fund our border patrol agents. President Biden and Democrats have done nothing to restore order at our border, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re entirely responsible for the Americans deserve better. Yesterday, my Agriculture and Manufacturing Liaison \u2014 Wes \u2014 attended a meeting held by the Northwest Iowa League of Cities in Sheldon. Northwest Iowa is a great place to live, work, and raise a family because our communities and neighbors do phenomenal work to keep it that way. American families are paying an extra for gas, groceries, and other necessities every month thanks to #Bidenomics. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a vital investment in the American economy. We cut taxes for our families. We lowered costs for our small businesses. We helped our farmers compete with China. We drove investment in our rural communities. We cannot let these tax cuts expire! President Biden\u2019s budget directly targets our families to fund his radical agenda. It devotes an additional billion to the IRS \u2014 not including the billion that Democrats authorized to hire an army of auditors \u2014 to extract more taxes from Americans. Serving the second-largest ag-producing district in the nation, I came to Congress to advocate for agriculture and biofuels. That's why I'm so passionate about passing a strong Farm Bill that helps our farmers and producers compete with and win against China. We need to finish the wall and hold drug traffickers accountable! That\u2019s why I introduced legislation to seize money from the drug cartels to build the border wall and keep deadly fentanyl away from our kids and out of our communities. Yesterday, I met with Major General Stephen Osborn, Adjutant General of the & Brigadier General Mark Muckey, Deputy Adjutant General of the Iowa Air National Guard. I received an update about the runway project at the Air Refueling Wing in Sioux City. President Biden shouldn\u2019t be using taxpayer dollars to force Americans to buy electric vehicles. In February, I led of my colleagues in urging the Biden administration to end its EV mandates on our families. Americans deserve to choose the vehicle that\u2019s best for them! The United States must stand with Israel. Last week, the Sergeant Bluff Advocate ran my weekly column about my work on the House Agriculture Committee. I\u2019m working to pass a strong Farm Bill for Iowa, strengthen crop insurance, support homegrown biofuels, and open new export markets for farmers and producers. China shouldn\u2019t own a single acre of our farmland. That\u2019s why I\u2019m glad that my amendment to the Lower Energy Costs Act \u2014 which bans China from buying American farmland suitable for energy production \u2014 passed by a vote of to American farmland belongs to American farmers! Earlier today, I had the opportunity to chat with small and independent insurance agents. We talked about the importance of making the qualified business income deduction permanent and strengthening crop insurance for farmers and producers. It was great to sit down with folks from Fort Dodge and Webster County to discuss their initiatives back home. We talked about a potential expansion of the Ag Park, Iowa Central\u2019s priorities, the Iowa ANG Test Squadron, and investments in the Fort Dodge Fire Department. I always enjoy having in my office to discuss our shared work to support hog farmers. I\u2019m working to overturn California\u2019s costly open new export markets for our pork, and fund animal disease prevention efforts at the federal level. I thank General for cosponsoring my bill to require President Biden to submit a balanced budget to Congress. His latest budget is just another unserious plan that adds trillions to our national debt and hikes taxes on our families. President Biden\u2019s open-border policies endanger our families and threaten our national security. As opposed to Biden\u2019s liberal agenda, I\u2019ve voted to finish the wall, end restore \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d and fully fund our border patrol agents. Thanks to #Bidenomics, inflation rose again for the third straight month. Coupled with President Biden\u2019s budget proposal, American families are facing higher prices, higher taxes, and more uncertainty. Wasteful spending has consequences. According to a recent survey, the highest ranked problem for business owners was finding skilled workers, surpassing even taxes and inflation. My Upward Mobility Enhancement Act would help small businesses invest in their employees\u2019 education. I\u2019m glad that my caseworker \u2014 Ann \u2014 could attend the groundbreaking for an expansion of facilities for the Boys & Girls Club of Story County last Friday in Ames. Projects like these are a worthy investment in our kids who are the future leaders of our state and nation. Today, my Agriculture and Manufacturing Liaison \u2014 Wes \u2014 attended the ribbon cutting ceremony for Sioux County Community Health Partners in Orange City. Serving on , ensuring our families have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare is a top priority for me. We have nearly trillion reasons why we need to balance our federal budget and end wasteful government spending. The Biden administration is asleep at the wheel when it comes to supporting homegrown biofuels. and I are calling on President Biden to open new export markets for American biofuels & work towards the full repeal of Brazil\u2019s soon-to-be tariff on American ethanol. Today, my Regional Director based out of Council Bluffs \u2014 Abby \u2014 attended the ribbon cutting ceremony for Hub in Carroll. This public-private partnership will support small businesses and power economic growth in Carroll County and the surrounding region! House Republicans passed nearly a year ago to finish the border wall and fully fund our border patrol at agents \u2014 the number that border patrol leaders say that they need to properly secure our border and protect our communities from fentanyl and other deadly drugs. We know that fentanyl is being illegally manufactured in China, shipped to Mexico, and smuggled across our open border. That's why I voted to impose sanctions on Chinese fentanyl manufacturers for their crimes. We must protect our kids & our communities. Hands-on experience is the best way to learn. I was very impressed with the Sioux City Schools Career Academy and enjoyed seeing the many projects that students are working on. The future of our state is bright! President Biden\u2019s budget would raise taxes by trillion, eliminate nearly American jobs, and leave our country with a budget deficit for Fiscal Year That\u2019s #Bidenomics at work. A strong workforce builds a strong economy. That\u2019s why I introduced legislation to help our businesses, manufacturers, hospitals, and other enterprises hire, train, and retain quality employees while supporting educational opportunities for their workers. President Biden\u2019s FY budget proposes trillion in spending every year. We can\u2019t afford more #Bidenomics. That\u2019s why I introduced legislation to require the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress \u2014 not an unserious plan that raises taxes & balloons our debt. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Americans benefit from the enhanced standard deduction and keep more of their hard-earned money. But this provision expires soon. That\u2019s why & I are working to make the enhanced standard deduction permanent! I appreciate for serving on my Agriculture Advisory Board and thank him for his advocacy on behalf of agriculture and biofuels. I'll continue my work to open new export markets for biofuels and support our farmers and producers. The death tax is an unfair and costly tax on family farms and small businesses. That\u2019s why I\u2019m leading legislation to permanently repeal the death tax. While President Biden and the Democrats look for any way to raise taxes, I will continue to help cut taxes for our families! Iowans who never attended college, entered the workforce early, or helped put their kids through school shouldn't be forced to pay for President Biden\u2019s latest student-loan bailout. The Supreme Court already ruled his plans and this effort is no different. This is great news for Sac County! My Honoring Police Officer and Service Act would also help police dogs like Remo receive the high-quality veterinary care that they need to serve and protect our families and communities. #BackTheBlue It's official. The federal government is now borrowing every SECOND. This level of spending is unsustainable and reckless. We need to balance our federal budget so that we can begin to reduce our nearly national debt. President Biden can actually secure our border by:Ending \"Remain in the border wall Instead, he continues to ignore the crisis that he created with his radical open-border policies that put our families in danger. In the poll in my weekly newsletter from last Friday, a strong majority of respondents answered that they support passage of the Farm Bill. I agree The Farm Bill is an important investment in our producers, our economy, and the competitiveness of American agriculture. My Upward Mobility Enhancement Act helps our businesses retain skilled workers while supporting educational opportunities for their employees. This is a strong investment not only in our workforce, but also in our economy and rural main streets. American families deserve lower taxes and lower gas prices! House Republicans passed \u2014 the Secure the Border Act \u2014 nearly a year ago. But President Biden and Senate Democrats continue to obstruct this solution to end the border fully funds our border patrol agents and finishes the wall. Let\u2019s get it signed into law! Last March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed my amendment to the Lower Energy Costs Act to ban China from buying American farmland suitable for energy production. It passed by a vote of to We can\u2019t let China control American resources ever. On Thursday, my Regional Director based out of Council Bluffs \u2014 Abby \u2014 met another police with the Iowa State Patrol. My Honoring Police Officer and Service Act will ensure that just like this one receive the high-quality medical care that they deserve. I continued my at EVAPCO \u2014 a manufacturing company \u2014 in Lake View. We need to strengthen our domestic manufacturing sector so that we don\u2019t have to rely on China for the products and materials that we need to power our nation and grow our economy. I kept my going with stops at Hi-Way Products and Hawkeye Fabrication in Ida Grove. Serving on , I will continue to be a strong voice for our manufacturers and small businesses. The U.S. biofuels industry is a critical component of our economy and an important economic engine in rural America. We must ensure American farmers have access to new and developing markets that will serve as new revenue sources for our producers. I kicked off my this morning at the Sioux City Schools Career Academy. By investing in our students, we\u2019re building a brighter future for our state and our country! According to the , President Biden's budget would \"reduce economic output by in the long run, slash wages by and kill about full-time equivalent jobs.\" We must reject this awful proposal & balance our budget! The Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity for students to showcase their artistic talents & compete for a chance to have their artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol or one of my district offices. I encourage all students to participate! I wrapped up today\u2019s by hosting my annual Military Academy Day at Iowa Central Community College in Fort Dodge. I appreciate the representatives from each of the academies who took time to answer questions and thank the students and their families for coming! Last February, I called out President Biden\u2019s plan to slash billions of dollars from Medicare Advantage \u2014 a vital program that serves over million seniors. Now, the Biden administration is making that proposal a reality to the detriment of our seniors. This afternoon, I spoke at the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Iowa State. This facility will ensure that we can protect our flocks and herds from animal diseases and keep Iowa an agricultural powerhouse. After my stop at Van Diest Medical Center, I ran into Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Deputies Hicok (left) and Opperman (right) at Subway in Webster City. Our police and law enforcement put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities. I will always #BackTheBlue! Today, I continued my at the Van Diest Medical Center in Webster City. Serving on , I\u2019m working to protect our rural hospitals, support our healthcare workers, and lower healthcare costs for our families and communities. President Biden is asleep at the wheel when it comes to advocating for our farmers and biofuels producers. and I are calling on the Biden administration to do more to open new export markets for American biofuels and enforce our trade laws. Year-round access to will lower gas prices for our families, support our farmers, and keep our biofuels industry strong. With inflation draining wallets and impacting our businesses, our families deserve relief at the pump and our ethanol producers deserve certainty.", "The greatest honor of my professional life has been serving the people of #SouthFlorida in #Congress.

They\u2019ve got as many ballots as are necessary. Rigged Election! Even Mexico uses Voter I.D. The States want to redo their votes. They found out they voted on a FRAUD. Legislatures never approved. Let them do it. BE STRONG! They just happened to find ballots late last night. The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries! THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR COUNTRY, NEEDS THE PRESIDENCY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE - THE POWER OF THE VETO. STAY STRONG! States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval. All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage! Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd is so happy with the fake voter tabulation process that he can\u2019t even get the words out straight. Sad to watch! If Vice President comes through for us, we will win the Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be). Mike can send it back! Get smart Republicans. FIGHT! Just happened to have found another ballots from Fulton County. Here we go!

Heading to Georgia now. See you soon! The \u201cSurrender Caucus\u201d within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective \u201cguardians\u201d of our Nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers! \u201cWe are not acting to thwart the Democratic process, we are acting to protect it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in the last few months, unprecedented amounts of Voter Fraud.\u201d True!

Sorry, but the number of votes in the Swing States that we are talking about is VERY LARGE and totally OUTCOME DETERMINATIVE! Only the Democrats and some RINO\u2019S would dare dispute this - even though they know it is true! The Swing States did not even come close to following the dictates of their State Legislatures. These States \u201celection laws\u201d were made up by local judges & politicians, not by their Legislatures, & are therefore, before even getting to irregularities & fraud, .... @senatemajldr @GOPLeader & THE WORLD!

Something how Dr. Fauci is revered by the LameStream Media as such a great professional, having done, they say, such an incredible job, yet he works for me and the Trump Administration, and I am in no way given any credit for my work. Gee, could this just be more Fake News? \u201cGeorgia election data, just revealed, shows that over votes illegally flipped from Trump to Biden.\u201d This alone (there are many other irregularities) is enough to easily \u201cswing Georgia to Trump\u201d. #StopTheSteal I spoke to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger yesterday about Fulton County and voter fraud in Georgia. He was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the \u201cballots under table\u201d scam, ballot destruction, out of state \u201cvoters\u201d, dead voters, and more. He has no clue! Republicans in Georgia must be careful of the political corruption in Fulton County, which is rampant. The Governor, , and his puppet Lt. Governor, , have done less than nothing. They are a disgrace to the great people of Georgia! The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of \u2019s ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries, many of whom report, purposely, very inaccurately and low. \u201cWhen in doubt, call it Covid.\u201d Fake News!

Additionally, the Georgia Consent Decree is & the State Presidential Election.... ....is therefore both illegal and invalid, and that would include the two current Senatorial Elections. In Wisconsin, Voters not asking for applications invalidates the Election. All of this without even discussing the millions of fraudulent votes that were cast or altered! Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!

I'm so thrilled that #Gloucester's Sawyer Free Library is now nationally recognized as one of the best libraries in the country! Something I already knew to be true, but now it's official. It was an honor to nominate the library for this award last year. Very well-deserved! By filing a motion to vacate, Marjorie Taylor Greene is just continuing the chaos that has plagued the House of Representatives for well over a year now.

Always good to get an update on my alma mater! #GoJacks President Biden\u2019s energy policies have driven energy prices up since day one of his administration. They share a huge amount of blame for the continued high prices South Dakotans are paying. Gas prices are up over since he took office. The Supreme Court shot down the admin\u2019s student loan repayment plan because it was not political reasoning. Forgiving student loans would cost the average SD taxpayer an extra in taxes, even if they didn\u2019t go to college themselves. It\u2019s simply unfair.

Great to see so many young people visiting DC and taking an interest in how their government works for them every day.

Tonight\u2019s State of the Union proved to be a political speech for the far left. We need a return to conservative and common sense leadership in the White House. Under President Biden, we have a border crisis, a nearly price increase in consumer goods, weak national security and no plan to get America back on track. Disappointed, but unfortunately not at all surprised. Great job on your response to this year\u2019s State of the Union. President Biden\u2019s policies have been hurting our country for over years. Senate Republicans are ready to get this country back on track. President Biden is calling for \u2018unification\u2019 in the most divisive way possible. His vision for America is not the path our country should be on. It\u2019s time to return conservative values to the White House. #SOTU FACT: CBP Agents seized over pounds of fentanyl at our southern border in and that\u2019s only what they were able to catch.

I'm filing a CRA with that would overturn the Biden recent decision to lift a long-standing ban on beef imports from Paraguay: South Dakota farmers and ranchers work tirelessly to produce the safest, highest quality and most affordable beef in the world.

Support for my bill, the SFC Heath Robinson Burn Pit Transparency Act, is building as we fight urgently for those exposed to toxins in the line of duty.

DOH must act now to improve testing, tracing, & transparency to prevent more unnecessary sickness & death. This court ruling reaffirms every American\u2019s right to privacy. Flagrant government overreach through this NSA program and others show that we cannot stand idly by as our freedoms are undermined. We must stand vigilant and fight for those freedoms. Yesterday, I hosted a tele-town hall meeting to update Hawai\u2018i residents about We\u2019ve heard horror stories of people not being informed about exposure or being discouraged from getting tested even if they have been exposed. People across the state have made huge sacrifices to their day-to-day lives following preventative measures. They expect Governor Ige to lead, to make sure his Department of Health is doing its job with a robust testing and tracing program that is transparent and accountable to the public.

Nearly Hawai\u2018i residents work in the independent restaurant industry which continues to be hammered hard by the coronavirus crisis. That puts enormous strain on them and their families to make ends meet and for these businesses to stay afloat. Our local restaurants are valued members of our community and this legislation provides assistance both to employees and independent restaurant owners to weather the storm of this pandemic.

Today, I spoke in the House during debate on the annual government funding bill addressing transportation matters to urge Congress to pass my amendment to protect essential air service which is vital to my Congressional district: Today, I spoke on the House Floor to urge colleagues to pass a bipartisan amendment to protect Americans\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights: Today, I announced the award of million in grants to seven Hawai\u02bbi universities and colleges through the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Native Hawaiian Serving Institutions Program.

Know your nearest shelter + be prepared to evacuate. For tips, visit M\u0101lama pono! Today, I announced funding for key programs benefiting the nation and Hawai\u2018i through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies funding bill for These provisions were included as part of a combined bill that was passed by the House today. That is why I fought to support programs like the State of the Birds \u2014 credited with reviving several endangered Hawai\u2018i bird populations \u2014 as well as the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund and the Regional Biosecurity Program for Micronesia and Hawai\u2018i. I worked with my colleagues to ensure that they get the resources needed to preserve and protect our beautiful but fragile ecosystem that is vital to the well-being of our home. Aloha `aina are the values instilled in me at a young age, as my parents taught me about the precious and unique natural ecosystems of Hawai\u2018i. I announced successful efforts to secure funding for a variety of priorities which were included in the Fiscal Year Military Construction and Veterans Affairs funding bill. Our veterans, including those in Hawai\u2018i, will get expanded access to VA care as this bill invests in programs targeted toward rural areas and the Pacific Basin. The military construction projects included in this bill will enhance the readiness of our forces in Hawai\u2018i and provide necessary safety upgrades for military facilities on the islands. Today, I announced funding for a number of key agriculture and food priorities for Hawai\u2018i in the billion Fiscal Year (FY) Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Funding Bill. Access to locally-grown nutritious food is crucial to improve health outcomes in Hawai\u2018i and around the country. This bill allows us to make needed, practical investments in our communities that will help us better empower farmers and strengthen our food security. Through this bill I was able to secure the funding and support needed to help Hawai\u2018i\u2019s farmers fight invasive pests as well as improve specialty crop production, floriculture, and programs that bring greater healthy food choices into our communities. Today, I announced that the Fiscal Year Legislative Branch funding bill would include a record for the Wounded Warrior Program and the Congressional Gold Star Family Fellowship Program. The start of the Congressional Gold Star Family Fellowship Program offers similar opportunities to family members of someone who has given their life in service to our nation. It\u2019s my hope that the full funding of these programs will grant opportunities to military families and encourage a better understanding of the issues that face the military. I and the Hawai\u2018i congressional delegation today urged President Trump to immediately provide support to the state as Hurricane Douglas approaches the islands. Today, I voted to pass the Great American Outdoors Act, which I co-sponsored. This legislation will fund important restoration and conservation work on public lands including Hawai\u02bbi\u2019s national parks - some of the most magnificent sites in the world. Today, I voted against the annual NDAA. While I successfully included several provisions of importance to Hawai\u2018i and the country\u2019s security, the positive elements of the bill were outweighed by overarching concerns I had with the massive bill. But at a time when many Americans are struggling and suffering, the massive cost of this defense bill at billion benefits the military industrial complex... ...continues to escalate the new Cold War and nuclear arms race, and needlessly puts more of our troops\u2019 lives at risk by continuing our decades-long war in Afghanistan. I could not in good conscience vote to pass it. As a senior member of HASC, I fought hard to get many provisions in this bill to protect Hawai\u2018i & our country, improve the lives of servicemembers & military families, provide transparency of the devastating humanitarian impact of US sanctions & address environmental threats. Yesterday, the House passed an amendment to the annual NDAA I introduced that would require an initial and annual report to Congress from the Administration reporting the humanitarian impact of U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile, the sanctioned country\u2019s leader is often left unaffected. There is currently no assessment or accountability for our country\u2019s leaders on the humanitarian disasters caused by these sanctions. My provision included in the NDAA changes that, by requiring an initial assessment followed by annual reports of the humanitarian impact of U.S. sanctions on other nations. Today, I spoke during the debate on the annual national defense bill to support two separate measures that would prevent authorization of funds to be used on nuclear yield testing and oppose the Trump withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty. President Trump\u2019s recent withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty and his plans to violate the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty are just two of his many actions that are pushing us closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. We must take action to halt the Trump Administration from leading us down this dangerous path of a new cold war and nuclear arms race. On Wednesday at PM HST, I will be hosting a Facebook Live virtual town hall event to update Hawai\u2018i residents about For more information: Today, I urged the House and Senate to pass the School Shooting Safety and Preparedness Act, following the recent release of a GAO report which examined gun violence data and the characteristics of school shootings in education. This report is just the latest example of how the collection of data is vital to efforts in Congress to help keep our kids safe in our schools. Congress needs to move forward and pass my School Shooting Safety and Preparedness Act... ...so that we have a standard definition of school shootings and can collect information about the unfortunate rise of these shootings so that our kids, parents, and teachers can focus on education, rather than wondering if they will survive their day at school. Yesterday, I announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce awarded in CARES Act funds to the Feed the Hunger Foundation which is a certified CDFI that provides loans in Hawai\u2018i to help farmers and food entrepreneurs to start and grow businesses. With the pandemic still in full force and Hawai\u2018i seeing positive case rates similar to what we were seeing at the outset of this crisis, we need to ensure that our families and communities continue to get the support they need. These resources will help during this short-term crisis and the long-term in two ways \u2014 helping to create a more sustainable food infrastructure and better food security while bolstering efforts to engage more people in the local food economy. Today at PM HT, I will be hosting a Facebook Live virtual town hall event to update Hawai\u2018i residents about I hope you will join me: On Wednesday at PM HST, I will be hosting a Facebook Live virtual town hall event to update Hawai\u2018i residents about You can watch the event on my Facebook Page. On Wednesday, I hosted a tele-town hall meeting to update Hawai\u2018i residents about joined by guests Darin Leong and Dr. Scott Miscovich. You can listen to the town hall online here: I strongly urge the Governor and mayors of Hawai\u2018i counties to continue the quarantine for trans-Pacific travelers because of the surge of infections occurring across the country... The travel quarantine must remain in place for the time being as we focus on containing and defeating the virus, massively increasing our testing and tracing capacity, and securing our medical supply chains. These steps are essential to get to a place where the people of Hawai\u2018i can be confident that travelers coming to our state will not bring greater risk and infections with them. SPC Vanessa Guillen volunteered to serve our country, and proudly wore the uniform. The Department of Defense Inspector General must conduct a full and independent Unfortunately, in the midst of their grief and uncertainty, Vanessa\u2019s family has suffered throughout her disappearance with no real answers or transparency about what happened to Vanessa and why. Vanessa and her family deserve justice and closure. Our servicemen and women deserve justice and faith that the military they serve in will take care of them. While we are too late to save Vanessa\u2019s life, we must honor her life by getting to the truth and working to prevent this from happening to others. On Wednesday at p.m. HST, I'll be hosting my next telephone town hall meeting to update Hawai\u2018i residents about joined by guests Dr. Scott Miscovich and Darin Leong. For more information and to sign up: This week, I introduced the Money Mule Awareness Act, which would help prevent criminals from exploiting vulnerable individuals and tricking them into acting as \u2018money mules\u2019 who launder their illegally obtained money for them. Many of our most vulnerable citizens, including elderly and those who are unemployed, have been hit hard by the pandemic, making them prime targets for scammers looking to prey on them. This bill takes the first step toward ensuring that financial institutions and individuals have the information and resources they need to recognize and prevent \u2018money mule\u2019 schemes. Today, I voted to pass the INVEST Act, to authorize funding for key infrastructure projects and improvements across the country. Across America our infrastructure is antiquated. Bridges and roads are crumbling. We need a commitment to rebuild America, not only to address the critical infrastructure on which Hawai\u2018i and our country depend, it also does so in a way that is safer, cleaner, and greener. This legislation benefits Hawai\u2019i in so many key areas: improvements for rural areas, and in transit, housing, broadband, school infrastructure, water systems, and environmental protection funding and programs. Ensuring that families have access to affordable childcare is crucial for family financial stability and early childhood development. Today, I announced a grant that will provide resources to Maui Family Support Services to ensure Native Hawaiian families are supported, especially in the midst of the ongoing pandemic. Today, I joined the family of missing Army Pfc. Vanessa Guillen who has been missing since April. I stand with the Guillen family in calling for Congressional oversight to find out exactly what happened to her. Today, I announced that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) awarded in CARES Act funds to the Hawai\u2018i Department of Transportation (HDOT) through its Section Rural Area Formula fund. The pandemic has wreaked havoc on our local economy and crippled many public services. These federal funds will help make sure that the public transportation that people depend on will continue to be available for those who need it most and be safe to use. Yesterday, I voted to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act which aims to improve accountability and transparency in policing in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, the victim of a recent, instance of police brutality. In order to bring about real change, partisan politics must end. Now is the time for us to stand together as Americans, for each other and for the future of our nation, and truly uphold these words from the Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

As the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic continue, I am continuing to work in Congress to make sure that all of Hawai\u2018i communities \u2014 from workers, farmers, and small business owners to our first responders, keiki, and k\u016bpuna \u2014 have access to federal support. These funds are absolutely vital to help bridge the gap, but we are not out of the woods yet. There is a lot more that must be done, and we will continue to fight for the people of Hawai\u2018i as we work together on the path to recovery. Today, I sent a letter to VA Sec. Wilkie and DOD Sec. Esper requesting information about servicemembers and veterans exposed to toxic burn pits and who have been infected or are being tested for infection. The coronavirus pandemic only increases the urgency of doing this because those exposed to burn pits face greater risks of health complications due to infection. Troops & veterans must be able to trust that DOD & VA acknowledge their toxic exposure, the health consequences they suffer as a result, & that they are collecting data to ensure they have access to testing, are getting informed care, & comprehensive treatment.", "I voted NO on the FISA The federal government should not be surveilling American citizens.

Happy to join to fight for our Gulf Coast Shrimpers. Rogue elements of the FBI \u201cupper echelon\u201d used FISA in their underhanded attempt to derail the election and to circumvent the will of the American People in electing Donald Trump. If they did that to Trump: they will do that to others. I will not vote for any FISA\u2026 Israel was attacked, and Israel is responding. President Biden has no business calling for a ceasefire. Israel should continue responding until Hamas is eradicated from the face of the earth and every single hostage is released. Over the past six months, we've witnessed an alarming surge in antisemitism to levels unseen in our nation's history, and it's utterly appalling. It's time for the federal government to ramp up its efforts to safeguard our Jewish friends. I am proud to join the in\u2026 Joe Biden must stop killing the industry that keeps Southeast Texas thriving. I don't care whether it's Republican or Democrat; don't stop energy production in Southeast Texas. It is that simple. Biden's LNG export ban should be reversed immediately. Today's field hearing Port Arthur, Texas, underscored the vital role of LNG in our community. Biden's pause on LNG exports threatens thousands of jobs and billions in investments. Grateful for the witnesses who joined us today to shed light on this critical issue. American taxpayers are the ones paying for the Biden Admins open border and green energy agenda.We must impeach Mayorkas. Joe Biden must enforce the border policies on the books. This admin needs to reverse its LNG export bans that cost my district jobs jobs jobs. Joe Biden's halt on LNG permits directly attacks Southeast Texas. Tomorrow, and I are heading to Port Arthur to discuss the crucial impact of LNG on Texas jobs & economic growth and how the misguided, politically motivated decision has real implications. Today, we honor and remember the Gold Star families who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. Your loved ones' bravery and selflessness will forever be cherished. We stand with you in gratitude and respect on this Gold Star Family Day. The latest & most-alarming offensive against Southeast Texas is the LNG export ban put in place by a president who is hyper-focused on killing the very industry that keeps my district's lights on. Keep up the excellent work ! If the federal government won't protect our border, TEXAS will. Joe Biden's blatant disregard and disrespect of Christianity to pander to transgenders is something I never thought would happen in America. This president continues to destroy American values and religion. Every day, on Good Friday, it is important to remember God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son. \"The Lord himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.\" - Deuteronomy Good\u2026 Joe Biden & Mayorkas are consistently sidestepping the rule of law to assist and guide unvetted illegal aliens into our communities & now helping them to fly directly to American cities. Today, I sent a letter demanding answers for the American people. The American people deserve better. I voted AGAINST the TRILLION omnibus with countless poison pills, not to mention it doesn't secure our southern border or put America first. Rather than prioritizing the security of our southern border and incorporating elements from H.R. Congress is about to approve a trillion package that funds the following: for an organization that gives out \u201ctransition\u201d clothing for minors in Wisconsin Joe Biden's every move and decision to kill our energy security has only resulted in leaving America more reliant on foreign advisories. Quite frankly, I'm surprised the president has the energy to do. These are the people that Joe Biden is allowing into our country. Thugs, rioters, rapists, murderers, the list goes on. Thank you to every single brave TX National Guardsmen at the southern border for protecting OUR citizens since Joe Biden won't. TRILLION funding package... Over pages... There are no real policy changes at our southern border... And continues to fund the same weaponized government at insane levels... I am a NO. The forced EV transition is a joke. All Americans deserve the freedom to choose what car they drive...not the EPA. Pipelines are the safest and most efficient ways to move the fuels that heat our homes, fuel our vehicles, and unleash our economy. Proud my bill, the Next Generation Pipelines and Development Act, with , passed the today. HUGE win for Texas. The federal government should take note. So we have Joe Biden to thank for these types of murdering, raping, violent criminals coming into our country\u2026 November can\u2019t get here quick enough\u2026rw Congress cannot continue to fund the very policies that incentivize illegals, drug cartels, and human smugglers to come across our border. It is past time to use the power of the purse. Americans can expect to get hit again by a terrorist attack if this continues, and that blame lies right at the feet of President Biden. America is unsafe because of Joe Biden. The border policies under the Biden admin need a complete before it is too late. Amen, ! Can you believe it? The federal government keeps on doing everything in its power to block Texas' efforts to safeguard Texans from the flood of illegal immigrants streaming across our border. It's downright outrageous! All Americans deserve the freedom to choose what car they drive...not the EPA. But the Biden admin doesn't believe in American's freedom to decide what car they drive. Can't make this stuff up... It\u2019s bad enough that Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden pander to the liberal leftists in our elections, but now they want to allow them to interfere in Israeli elections, too? Absolutely not.

No matter how much you try to convince Americans that it is an outright ban. It isn't. Over of my constituents, when asked, agree that TikTok should cut ties with the Chinese Communist Party. The audacity and lack of knowledge that & have about Southeast Texas is laughable. The chemical industry is essential for Southeast Texas and the entire world. I sent them a letter slamming them for visiting my district last month for a \"toxic tour.\" Undocumented Immigrants, newcomers & noncitizens are all the same thing as illegals. Some of them are murderers, drug dealers & rapists. Biden was shamed into apologizing by his leftist friends. How sad!! He should call them what they really are...illegals. While President Biden was campaigning for another term, he forgot to address how we will get our nation back on solid ground. His SOTU speech was a slap in the face for every single American. He refused to face the reality of his failed administration. Houston is a major hub for United Airlines and the public is concerned about the recent incidents. We deserve answers. The American dream has turned into a nightmare under Joe Biden.

Inflation has left families trying to make ends\u2026 He\u2019s talking about his predecessor didn\u2019t have tough talk on China. The Bidens were getting money from China.

This directly impacts jobs in Southeast Texas and makes our allies more reliant on bad actors. I will always stand for LIFE. #SOTU Joe Biden starts his speech by begging Congress for more money for Ukraine. Mr. President - Secure our OWN border. Put America FIRST. History is watching. Get ready to hear more empty promises, more blame, more excuses, and absolutely no accountability for the millions of illegal immigrants Joe Biden has allowed into our communities. Federalizing Texas's electric grid = Typical government thinking, even communist-style thinking - the big, overblown government needs to control everything. I will continue to fight to ensure that Texas' grid stays in the hands of Texans & not bureaucrats\u2026 Democrats continue to show their true colors. of them voted against a bill that requires ICE to arrest and detain illegal aliens like Laken Riley\u2019s murderer until they are removed from the country. They don't care that Americans are dying at the hands of illegal aliens. It's high time President Biden takes responsibility for the mess our union is in. But don't hold your breath, folks. TikTok's time is almost up. If it sides with the Chinese Communist Party and refuses to divest from its parent company, ByteDance, it will face a prohibition in the U.S. Who will they pick...the CCP or the security of Americans?? And yet the President is suing Texas for installing fencing and razor wire at our southern border. The American people didn't hire you to create a full-blown invasion at our southern border that is killing Americans. But...I bet you won't address the million illegal immigrants you have let into our nation. After five months of terrible continuing resolutions and promises of better outcomes with individual spending bills, Congress turned its back on the American people and passed part one of a trillion omnibus spending bill. I voted NO. I promised Southeast Texas that we would fight to reduce Washington's wasteful spending and ensure that we didn't dig ourselves deeper into debt; this bill does the complete opposite. I cannot, in good conscience, vote to continue to fund \u201cDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\u201d (DEI) and Critical Race Theory curricula, disastrous border policies, COVID vaccine mandates, and a weaponized DOJ.

Expanding the economic benefits of trade is a common goal for and me. It was great to welcome several members of the alliance to my office to discuss how we can advance the future Interstate The next day the Senate passed my bipartisan, bicameral I believe China is suppressing free speech on TikTok. For example: Hashtags for Uyghurs, Tibet, and Tiananmen Square are far more prevalent on Instagram than on TikTok. The difference between the two platforms is astonishing. Read my statement on U.S. Border Patrol Agent Christopher Luna, who was laid to rest in his hometown of Edinburg, Texas this week. Agent Luna was on board a National Guard helicopter when it went down in La Grulla, Texas, killing him and two members of the National Guard, and\u2026 There are many reasons that Americans should be concerned that the CCP essentially owns TikTok. For starters, China can easily spy on us using the data gleaned from the app. Secondly, it\u2019s a propaganda machine. My recently introduced legislation, the Illegal Red Snapper Enforcement Act would develop a standard methodology for identifying the country of origin of red snapper imported into the United States. Currently, red snapper are being poached by criminal cartels and sold back into\u2026 Utterly horrific. This is only going to get worse. The Biden body bags keep stacking higher and higher. President Biden has made a political decision to keep the border open, no matter the cost. As a proud Houstonian, it was great to welcome Houston City Councilwoman to Washington to discuss the city\u2019s efforts to create opportunities for Texans, build up the infrastructure in the Lone Star State\u2019s largest city. Democrats know that Adeel Mangi\u2019s nomination to the Third Circuit is hanging on by a string. The Biden administration can\u2019t get away with appointing radical leftists who support groups calling to abolish the police. Biden\u2019s new budget is a campaign wish-list. It is totally out-of-touch with real Americans. The budget will raise gas prices to astronomical levels\u2014which is what congressional Democrats and the Biden White House want. .: Cruz introduces bill to have Bastrop post office named after war hero Billy Waugh I am proud that is supportive of my legislative push to strengthen the U.S. distribution transformer supply chain and stabilize domestic manufacturing to meet the increasing demand for electricity, especially at home in the Lone Star State. This is a bipartisan\u2026 Democrats know that Adeel Mangi\u2019s nomination to the Third Circuit is hanging on by a thread. Why? He served on the advisory board of the radically antisemitic Rutgers Center for Security, Race, and Rights, whose director issued a statement where she said \u201cWe are in awe of the\u2026 RELEASE: Sen. Cruz Response to Schumer\u2019s Israel Joe Biden apologized for calling Laken Riley\u2019s murderer an illegal. He would rather be politically correct than comfort an American family who just had their daughter killed. This is where the Democrats\u2019 priorities lie. It was great to sit down with Dallas City Councilwoman to discuss her commitment to fighting for the top priorities facing Texans in the , as well as our shared commitment to stand unequivocally with Israel. \u201cTed Cruz says there\u2019s a chance of Congress passing college sports legislation this year\u201d | Democrats are not interested in \u201celection integrity\u201d \u2014 they are interested in power. They are \u201cprotecting democracy\u201d by attempting to remove President Trump from ballots. Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and every other Democrat have looked the other way when it comes to securing our border. The pain, suffering, and death is worth it to them in exchange for political power.", "In The Biden Administration used taxpayer funds to fly over illegal immigrants into our country. This is unacceptable. I co-signed a letter led by to hold President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas accountable. Read it here: Over million American households use gas stoves. This type of power should never have been given to unelected bureaucrats and it is time for it to end. Lime plants provide materials critical for construction, steel manufacturing, treating drinking water and wastewater, and air pollutant removal. I led a letter to the EPA calling for the withdrawal of their harmful and unnecessary rule regulating lime plants. Read it here Thanks to the following cosigners: FISA is critical for our national security, especially at a time when we have no idea who is in our country due to the border crisis President Biden has created. Today's bill addressed ending the abuses while providing the tools we need to protect us from attack. Even though some necessary amendments were not adopted, I still believe FISA is a crucial tool to protect our nation. The Biden Administration wants to regulate every aspect of your life. They wanted to take away our gas stoves and pressured the media to cover it up when they got caught. There\u2019s a chance of severe weather across the state today. Be sure to stay informed so you can stay safe. Overall CPI inflation has increased since Biden took office in Prices are continuing to rise and real earnings are continuing to fall. Americans cannot afford #Bidenomics. Why would they refuse to turn over the recordings if there is nothing to hide? The American people should have all of the information to help them decide if the President is fit for office. The auto industry in Alabama is booming. If the UAW came into our state, the ruin of Detroit and Cleveland would be duplicated. To keep our state thriving, we must keep the UAW out. They would do nothing but jeopardize our jobs and suffocate our growth. Great to speak in Hoover yesterday at a joint chambers of commerce luncheon. Special thanks to Kirk Mancer with the Shelby County Chamber, and also to the Gardendale, Hoover, Montevallo, Mountain Brook, and Vestavia Hills Chambers. I am disappointed to see the White House move so quickly to waste taxpayer funds. If the Biden administration was focused on helping Americans and lowering energy costs, they would invest in affordable and reliable American energy instead of radical climate activist groups. Americans are asking for lower grocery prices and cheaper energy bills, not for billions to be sent to groups and radical climate activists. Regardless of the EPA\u2019s rash decisions, Congress is committed to conducting oversight on these funds to root out any corruption or abuse. Like I said, I\u2019m disappointed, but not surprised. There\u2019s a chance of severe weather across Alabama tonight. Be sure to stay safe and informed. If he didn't do this, then who did? Who is running the Biden Administration? Wishing everyone a happy and blessed Easter. He is risen! \"But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.\" - Isaiah I hope everyone has a blessed Good Friday. Last week, the House passed my bill to eliminate billion of waste and shift the focus to where it should be, affordable and reliable American energy. I urge the Senate to pass this important legislation immediately. Thanks to and for helping us celebrate the passage of H.R. I appreciate the support of my colleagues in passing the Cutting Green Corruption and Taxes Act. This is a major step towards securing American energy and reducing energy costs. This is a win for the American people! I voted against the bloated spending package. H.R. helps lower energy costs and unleash American energy by repealing Biden and Congressional Democrats' billion slush fund and the natural gas tax put in place by their misnamed \"Inflation Reduction Act.\" I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this important legislation. This is more than just chaos, this is an invasion. President Biden has the authority to stop this at any moment. We must secure our borders immediately. A carbon tax would do nothing but further increase high energy costs, putting even greater strain on American families already struggling to make ends meet. I appreciate 's leadership on this commonsense resolution. It was a pleasure speaking to the University of Alabama School of Social Work students in D.C. with . These students are the future leaders of our nation, and I look forward to seeing how they make Alabama proud. Someone is lying to . Why lie if there is nothing to hide? Watch my full questioning here: The President claims he wants to work with Congress to lower energy prices, but his actions continue to say otherwise. If he meant what he said, he would encourage Congressional Democrats to support this bill and would sign it the moment it hits his desk. The farmers, ranchers, fishers, and foresters in and across the country work tirelessly to feed our nation and boost our economy. On #NationalAgDay, join me in thanking them for all they do! I introduced the Citizen Ballot Protection Act in the House because Americans deserve to know their elections are secure. Thanks to for introducing this critical legislation in the Senate. The time is now to protect our free and fair elections. Great to be in Center Point this morning for the Annual Prayer Breakfast with Mayor Bobby Scott. Foreign adversaries spying on Americans will not be tolerated. Time is up for ByteDance and the Chinese Communist Party. Every state is a border state. The number of criminal convictions of noncitizens has skyrocketed since Biden took office. We must secure our border before more innocent lives are lost. Since President Biden took are spending over more a year to buy basic necessities Americans' real average weekly wages are down Bidenomics = Americans are spending more and making less. The situation currently unfolding at is unacceptable. When parents send their kids to Space Camp in Alabama, they should be confident they are going to a safe, educational environment. Space Camp should have the safety of our children as their first priority. Thanks to for cosponsoring this important legislation to help secure our elections. Last night, said it well: \"Right now, our Commander in Chief is not in command. The free world deserves better than a dithering and diminished leader.\" With President Biden at the helm, the state of our union is in danger. Read my full statement: Under Trump, there were noncitizens convicted for sexual assault. Since then, under Biden, there have been convictions. This is a increase. Convictions of noncitizens for other crimes under Biden compared to more assaults and burglaries and more more drug offenses According to the CBP, from predominantly the four years Trump was in office (and our border secured), there were convictions of noncitizens for homicide or manslaughter, versus convictions from through Feb. This is a increase under Biden. In just three years of Biden, the number of criminal convictions by noncitizens has skyrocketed past the amount in the four years under Trump. A thread Biden's Green New Deal policies are making American families poorer and basic necessities more expensive. America is becoming more dependent on China and less competitive, less productive, and less secure. We are over minutes into his speech and President Biden has yet to mention the crisis at our southern border. Every day he ignores our border, Americans are put in danger. His negligence is unacceptable. I came for the State of the Union speech and apparently walked into a Biden campaign speech. Biden is addressing every problem American families are facing and explaining how he will make them worse. Biden wants everybody but Hunter to pay their taxes. Here\u2019s a quick fact check on Biden\u2019s analysis of the state of our economy during his #SOTU Two weeks ago, Laken Riley was murdered by an illegal immigrant. If it were not for Biden's failure to secure the southern border, Laken, and many others, would still be here. Today, I proudly voted for the Laken Riley Act. The Biden Administration must be held accountable. Voting on two different days does not change the fact that Congress is considering the first half of an omnibus bill. Congress has repeatedly ignored the debt crisis, the immigration crisis, and a host of other problems in exchange for temporary funding bills. Now, we are given a set of appropriation bills negotiated by only a handful of members. These bills lack important policy changes and are devoid of necessary constraints on spending at a time when our national debt is over trillion. I made a commitment to vote for sound policy and to reduce wasteful government spending. Unfortunately, this bill misses the mark. We must change the process and commit to doing the hard work to get appropriations done and avoid forced votes on bad bills. The American people deserve to know the truth about the Biden crime family. Accountability is here. The Biden Administration used taxpayer dollars to secretly fly illegal immigrants into the country while our southern border is being invaded. This is more than the population of Shelby, Chilton, and Bibb counties combined. Hamas broke a ceasefire to slaughter innocent civilians. Israel has every right to defend themselves from terrorists. The United States must stand with Israel. As I predicted back in December, SCOTUS threw out Colorado's attempt to remove Trump from the ballot. This is the right decision. It is up to the people to decide who they want as their leaders, not a bunch of liberal judges in a state like Colorado. Alabamians should be proud will be responding to the SOTU next week. I'm looking forward to hearing her share a message of hope for the American people. As we round out Black History Month, join me in remembering the Tank Battalion. In honor of their service in WWII and being the first Black American armored unit, I introduced a bill to award them the Congressional Gold Medal. Read more here: There have already been over million illegal immigrant encounters since October. Our top priority should be fixing Biden\u2019s border crisis. We must secure our borders immediately. Injecting racism into things like Medicare will have a serious effect on our healthcare system. Fortunately, I have a bill to stop CRT and DEI in our healthcare system: The border crisis is a national security crisis. Laken Riley should still be alive today. This is unacceptable. Our borders must be closed immediately before anyone else gets hurt due to Biden\u2019s reckless policies. Had a great time today at our first Mayors\u2019 Luncheon of the year. It\u2019s always a pleasure hearing from mayors across the district. Great to be in Gardendale this morning with Mayor Stan Hogeland at the annual prayer breakfast. \u201cFirst in war, first in peace, and first in the in the hearts of his countrymen, President George Washington was second to none in humble and enduring scenes of private life.\u201d - Henry Lee III Happy birthday to the father of our nation! I hope you are having a happy Presidents' Day! Who do you think is our nation's greatest President? The man serving as the leader of the free world should be able to pass a cognitive test. Thanks to for having me on yesterday. The conclusion that Biden is unfit to stand trial has nothing to do with his age, but with his cognitive decline. I'm about to go live with on . Listen below \"It's two of the most clueless people that have ever been in the executive office,\" Rep. Gary Palmer, from Alabama, told Fox News. President Biden's age has nothing to do with it. It's about his cognitive decline and inability to perform his duties. The Hur report and Biden's news conference are very concerning. The American people should have confidence their President is mentally fit for office.", "Joe Biden and Congressional Democrats are literally cheering about killing unborn children on the House floor. \u201cThose who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin Members of Congress voted to continue letting the FBI illegally spy on Americans without warrants. Wow. House Republicans and House Democrats just voted AGAINST requiring the FBI to get a warrant to search Americans\u2019 data. So much for supporting and defending the U.S. Constitution. Today members face a simple question: Will they allow mass surveillance of the American people to continue \u2014 or will they safeguard their constituents\u2019 amendment freedoms? I choose to safeguard liberty. GET A WARRANT. #FISA We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. How many members of Congress will break this promise today by voting against protecting the American people\u2019s amendment rights? Thank you to & for having me on the Fresh Freedom Podcast this week! Check out the full episode: The Intel Committee\u2019s amendments expand FISA\u2019s surveillance authorities. The Judiciary Committee\u2019s amendments safeguard the American people\u2019s liberties. Americans are watching closely to see how their members vote. Yes, he just said the quiet part out loud. FREEDOM OVER FEAR. GET A WARRANT. #FISA The U.S. Constitution is NOT a suggestion. Deep State actors like FBI Director Wray use fear to eliminate our freedoms. Congress must end mass surveillance under FISA by requiring a warrant to search American citizens\u2019 data. President Trump supports a FISA warrant requirement. President Biden does not. Tells you everything you need to know. Guess who opposes a FISA warrant requirement? Joe Biden. Color me shocked. Congress must force the government to GET A WARRANT to stop Joe Biden from illegally spying on the American people. GET A WARRANT #FISA Does the FBI currently comply *in every way* with FISA FBI Director Wray: \u201c\u2026.My understanding is that we\u2019re in compliance with the law.\u201d Convincing. The FBI has conducted more than improper searches on American citizens using FISA authorities. Since Joe Biden took office, Georgians\u2019 expenses have increased by OVER due to inflation. The American people are fed up. This is Joe Biden\u2019s America. Deceitful. Despicable. Delusional. There is no equivalence between the government offering small businesses PPP grants during the pandemic and students voluntarily taking out loans to pay for college. Americans are sick and tired of Bidenomics and the White House\u2019s lies. I\u2019m already working on a Congressional Review Act joint resolution of disapproval to stop the ATF\u2019s latest overreach. Stay tuned. Americans are drowning in high prices under Joe Biden. FISA wasn\u2019t defeated yesterday\u2014but a rule (procedural motion) to move forward on the bill was. House Republican leadership is currently considering a path forward for the FISA bill. I encourage Speaker Johnson to work with pro-privacy members of Congress to protect Americans\u2019\u2026 The Fourth Amendment SHALL NOT BE VIOLATED. cc: Intelligence Community Joe Biden\u2019s Education Secretary still can\u2019t define what a woman is. The same members fighting against an amendment to end warrantless surveillance of the American people gave Congress a carve out in the FISA reauthorization bill. Apparently the Swamp doesn\u2019t want to be spied on\u2014but is perfectly fine with the FBI spying on their constituents. I\u2019m with ! Support Amendment rights End mass The Senate MUST hold Sec. Mayorkas accountable for failing to do his job and secure the border. The Fourth Amendment is not a suggestion. cc: Old Joe has confused non-taxable income with one of his \u201cloans.\u201d But I certainly hope the IRS received its \u201cfair share\u201d of for the Big Guy! Joe Biden once again announces that he will transfer millions more in student debt onto the backs of hardworking taxpayers. This scam is nothing more than a desperate attempt to buy votes with Americans\u2019 hard-earned money. Biden\u2019s border crisis is a national security threat. It\u2019s simple: CUT spending and SECURE the border. Abandoning these priorities while advancing a pricey package to defend Ukraine\u2019s borders would represent an utter betrayal of the American people. On Gold Star Spouses Day, we honor the husbands and wives of our fallen service members and recognize their ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms, their admirable strength, and unwavering courage. God bless our military and their loved ones. Reminder that Joe Biden is using YOUR taxpayer dollars to fly illegals into America. He is the America LAST President. Democrats continue to waste taxpayer dollars on Joe Biden\u2019s intentional illegal invasion. The Left is America LAST. In an attempt to save himself politically, Joe Biden recklessly drained our SPR to historic lows. Now that the price of oil has spiked, he claims it\u2019s too expensive to refill. This is a major self-inflicted national security risk. Americans are paying more for gas under the current Administration. Joe Biden has declared war on American energy. Bidenomics continues to fail the American people. Americans simply cannot afford Bidenomics. Borrowing billions of dollars to protect Ukraine\u2019s borders while OUR southern border is being invaded is a slap in the face to the American people. The White House has flown unvetted illegal aliens directly into the heartland to create an appearance of reduced border encounters. Imagine if the Biden Administration worked this hard to actually secure our southern border. Bidenomics continues to crush the American people. Over the past few weeks, Joe Biden: Apologized for calling Laken Riley\u2019s murderer an illegal alien rather than apologizing to Laken\u2019s family. Attended a star-studded fundraiser rather than honoring slain NYPD officer Jonathan Diller. Declared Easter Sunday as so-called\u2026 He is Risen! Wishing you and your family a blessed Easter. Joe Biden\u2019s open border policies are victimizing American citizens. Joe Biden is in NYC for a fundraiser with Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Lizzo. Donald Trump is in NYC to honor NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller, who was recently murdered by a career criminal. Quite the contrast in leadership and priorities. Joe Biden is reportedly considering a plan to provide amnesty to illegal aliens who have been in the U.S. for years. Democrats\u2019 radical immigration agenda is designed to import new voters. We must stop this insanity from destroying our country. REMINDER Since Joe Biden took office, there have been OVER MILLION illegal crossings nationwide. The most ever recorded in U.S. history. Earlier this week, an illegal alien was charged with raping a \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d girl in Alabama. Pure evil. How many more avoidable tragedies must our country endure before Joe Biden SECURES the border and DEPORTS illegals in our communities? The FBI was correctly called out in a community note for lying about its warrantless surveillance of Americans. Congress must eliminate FISA abuse and protect the American people\u2019s privacy. NYC\u2019s million pilot program that hands illegal aliens prepaid debit cards costs MORE THAN DOUBLE what New York State has allocated for veteran services. Unconscionable. Democrats continue to prioritize illegal aliens over the American people. Unfortunately, this has become the norm in our nation\u2019s capital. Yet DC\u2019s local \u201cleaders\u201d continue to turn a blind eye to the crime crisis they created. Washington\u2019s residents and visitors deserve better. Even Joe Biden knows \u201cBidenomics\u201d is a total failure! The definition of America LAST. An illegal alien was charged in the carjacking and murder of a Michigan woman. Joe Biden\u2019s open border policies continue to kill innocent Americans. Crushing inflation. Open borders. Dangerous crime. This is Joe Biden\u2019s America. \u201cThe train is coming.\u201d Fani Willis shows ZERO remorse for her inappropriate behavior, misconduct, and perjury. Democrats are shameless in their radical efforts to take down President Trump. Today, on National Medal of Honor Day, we celebrate more than American recipients of the highest military decoration awarded by the United States Armed Services. Thank you to all the brave service members who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to fight for our\u2026 Every solitary Republican who voted to fund the woke policies and wasteful spending in the Swamp's omnibus owns every bit of President Biden\u2019s crises from here on out.", "Today, far right judges in Arizona revived a law from over years ago that bans nearly all abortions \u2014 a decision that will undoubtedly strain access in states like New Mexico, where abortion remains legal. I intro'd the Office of Colonias & Farmworker Initiatives Establishment Act to help farmworkers & residents of Colonias better access federal programs & resources. This bill would help families in Colonias in NM, AZ, CA & TX put food on the table and drive economic growth.

As a lead negotiator of the Safer Communities Act, I worked hard to crack down on illegal firearm trafficking & keep weapons like ghost guns out of the hands of criminals. This new rule will save lives AND safeguard the rights of law abiding firearm owners.

Clean water is essential to the health and economic well-being of working families. I applaud for taking a major step forward today in protecting our communities from dangerous PFAS chemicals & helping New Mexicans build a stronger foundation for the future. The buildout of our clean energy and fully electrified future is a opportunity to grow the middle class. If we invest in training our workforce and small business owners, we will be ready for what\u2019s ahead. Make no mistake: I will not stop fighting to restore the freedom to choose nationwide. I will also continue to work to pass the ACCESS Act, ensuring that New Mexicans aren\u2019t left to pay the price for the decisions of radical politicians in states across the country. Democrats are fighting to protect your reproductive freedoms. Republicans are working to punish women for making their own health care decisions. Today marks years since the end of the Battle of Bataan. Nearly NM National Guardsmen bravely defended Bataan & Corregidor alongside thousands of Americans & Filipinos before enduring the Bataan Death March and unthinkable conditions as POWs.

I couldn\u2019t agree more, : Community schools help working families succeed. I\u2019m proud to have secured nearly million for community schools in New Mexico to support working families and children all across our state.

The Trinity Downwinders deserve recognition and compensation for what they endured so that our nation could be victorious in the Second World War. This is long overdue.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m encouraged to see the U.S. Senate approve the & pass of my provisions today. From making sure treatment is available for pregnant women who have a substance abuse disorder to cracking down on fraudulent prescriptions, these bipartisan proposals will help states address the opioid epidemic. I will continue working to advance policies that will provide #Nevada the tools it needs to help individuals who are struggling with addiction and reduce the number of overdose deaths.

A state without a single nuclear power plant should not have to shoulder the entire nation\u2019s nuclear burden. Nevada has one of the highest rates of veteran suicide in the country. That is why I'm urging my colleagues to support my legislation that will help provide supportive mental health services to our military heroes fighting invisible injuries. No veteran in Nevada should have to fight long waits for a mental health appointment. While Congress has made welcome progress on the issue of reducing veteran suicide, more must be done.

The agreement also included funds for #NV military construction projects & my provisions to support our veterans & strengthen water security: The cost of providing the care and benefits we owe to our veterans for their service & sacrifices should not be part of any reasoning to reject legislation that extends disability benefits to our Blue Water Navy veterans exposed to Agent Orange.

This opens up additional resources for #NV ranchers and farmers who have lost so much to these blazes. Thank you to the students with the Close Up Foundation in #LasVegas for asking thoughtful questions during our visit yesterday. Always great to see young people engaged and interested in the legislative process. Great to see Rosemary Vassiliadis, the Director of Aviation , to discuss the airport's continual growth & how we can work together to promote more domestic and international tourism to NV and support the tens of millions of visitors who travel to #LasVegas each year. DOE should not move forward with its proposal to store weapons-grade plutonium in #Nevada before fully evaluating the health, safety, and environmental impact that it would have on our state. Not only does shipping up to one metric ton of plutonium across the country likely present risks to those living along the proposed transportation routes, storing this material just a few miles from #LasVegas could threaten the health & safety of Nevadans & our tourism economy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m strongly opposed to this proposal and am pressing DOE to conduct a full environmental impact analysis before moving forward with any further action.

We have high-tech scanners that can detect fentanyl before it crosses our southern border \u2013 but they\u2019re sitting unused because Congress hasn\u2019t allocated the funds to install them.

Way to go!! I\u2019ll be on MPR today at noon to talk about our race here in We\u2019ve got a tough fight ahead of us, but this campaign\u2019s got grit and determination. Tune in to hear more! Rather than respecting every family\u2019s freedom to make their own decisions at the doctor\u2019s office, the GOP is putting women in jail and prosecuting them for murder. It\u2019s despicable, and it\u2019s why we need to vote like our freedom depends on it in Because it does.\u2026 Today, right-wing judges intent on pushing the GOP's agenda stripped four million women, and millions more families, of the freedom to make their own health care decisions without government interference. But make no mistake, the Republican Party's crusade is far from over. They\u2026 Happy Easter to everyone celebrating across Minnesota!

To tackle rising temperatures head on, I\u2019m fighting for an \u201call of the above\u201d energy approach that invests in renewables, creates well-paying jobs in manufacturing and promotes American energy\u2026 For the record, I never thought A-Rod was good enough for JLo or the Lynx. The \u201cendgame\u201d for Republicans has always been the same: a nationwide abortion ban. No matter what they call it, their legislation would take away the freedom of every family, in every state, to make their own decisions at the doctor\u2019s office. I took on Big Pharma and wrote the bill that caps insulin at for America\u2019s seniors, because no one in this country should have to ration a life saving medication. I\u2019m proud to see more and more people finally benefiting from affordable insulin, but our work isn\u2019t done.\u2026 Hey team - today, moved my race from \u201cLikely\u201d to \u201cLean Democrat.\u201d This confirms what I\u2019ve always known: could be my closest race yet. But our team has grit and determination. Can you chip in to keep blue? Way to go, Hackercats! Good luck at the world championships. Banning abortion wasn\u2019t enough for Missouri Republicans. Now they've effectively banned divorce while a woman is pregnant. This is downright despicable. When we say our freedoms are on the ballot in this is what we mean. I had an absolute blast in Eagan this afternoon at the annual True Blue event, where I first announced to that I was running for Congress nine years ago!

I am so inspired by the energy and enthusiasm of this campaign\u2019s fellows. They show up every day to defend democracy and fight for DFL values. Thank you all, we\u2019re so very lucky to have you on Team Angie! Make no mistake. Republicans want to ban abortion at the federal level, and they intend to ban the procedure even for pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother. That\u2019s why doctors across America are calling GOP bans \u201cdangerously unclear.\u201d We need to elect a pro-choice\u2026 And the winner is: the state of Minnesota! What great basketball at the Big women\u2019s tournament this week. Fun time at the finals today! It\u2019s gotcha day for the boss of the house - Sophie. She\u2019s almost forgiven us for bringing a puppy into the house this past year. #sisters To the more than members of Congress, of whom are Republicans, petitioning the Supreme Court to strip away every woman\u2019s right to a safe, effective and legal medication abortion: get out of our business. Politicians should stay the hell out of our personal family\u2026 Dakota had a blast at Alimagnet dog park in Burnsville this morning with her best dog friend Winnie, and Cheryl and I did too! Spring is right around the corner Great to see such enthusiasm in Lakeville today at the DFL Convention! With so much at stake in November, we need to work like our freedoms depend on it.

It\u2019s long past time for an energy approach that reduces emissions, creates good-paying jobs and\u2026 As a gun owner, I believe in the Second Amendment. I also believe in common-sense gun safety legislation, because every Minnesotan deserves the freedom to live without the constant fear of gun violence. Proud to be endorsed.

In we need to vote like our freedoms are on the ballot. Because they are.\u2026 Thank you to every single person who came out to caucus tonight! I had the privilege of meeting with friends and neighbors from all across and listening to why they are excited to make their voices heard at the ballot box in Hope everyone had as much fun as I did!

Proud to continue the fight to lower health care costs by taking on drug pricing - starting with my bill to cap insulin at a month. Congratulations on being named Elementary Music Teacher of the Year, Becca! Your students are so lucky to have you in the classroom. This is what it looks like each week when Cheryl tells her I\u2019m coming home from DC. Members of Congress should be in Washington to serve their constituents \u2013 not special interests. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been fighting to take money out of politics since my very first day in Washington. I\u2019m honored to have received an A rating from for my work. As the proud mom of a trade school graduate, I\u2019m so encouraged to see career and technical education being taught at the high school level. In the century, you shouldn\u2019t need a traditional four-year degree to be successful in Minnesota.

I\u2019m working to keep politicians out of your family\u2019s reproductive health care decisions. In keeping government out of your family's health care decisions is on the ballot.

In let\u2019s show these anti-choice radicals the door. The Scott County Sheriff\u2019s department provides crucial services that keep us all safe. Their Community Academy is an excellent way to learn more about the department and find ways to strengthen their partnership with local organizations.

Any attempt by the GOP to undermine the will of the voters is as undemocratic as it is shameful. When working people band together to collectively bargain for fair wages, we all win. Case in point: this summer\u2019s UAW strike has raised wages across the auto industry, for both union and nonunion workers alike. Bianca! I can\u2019t believe I even have to say this in but birth control is safe and effective and it should be legal in all states. We cannot let Mike Johnson and his radical GOP continue to chip away at our fundamental freedoms. Vote them out. Today, I\u2019m thinking of every veteran across our great country who put their life on the line to defend the freedoms that we take for granted. In my family, that includes my grandfather, a WWII Navy veteran, and my two uncles, who both served in Vietnam. The American people made themselves crystal clear last night when they rejected the GOP and its crusade to take away reproductive freedoms. In let's keep the momentum going and take back the House. When we treat working people with respect and pay them what they deserve, we all win. Proud to stand with the workers of First Avenue in their fight for fair wages and decent working conditions.

Today, I met with and Korbel School\u2019s Colorado Project to learn how this group of Coloradans is working together on a shared vision for our state\u2019s future, including thoughtful recommendations on everything from water conservation to affordable housing. Current public lands oil & gas bonding rules burden taxpayers with the costs of cleaning up abandoned wells, and they haven't been updated in years. I\u2019ve pushed for years to hold oil & gas companies accountable. BLM\u2019s new rules will protect communities and natural resources. These PROTECT grants, funded through the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will help Golden, Aurora, and Denver rebuild essential roads and bridges, and protect Coloradans\u2019 property from future flooding. In the richest country in the world, it\u2019s a disgrace that millions of parents struggle to feed their families. I joined and to urge my colleagues to pass the Wyden-Smith tax bill and expand the Child Tax Credit to support families across the country.

The U.S.-Japan alliance is the strongest it's ever been and we\u2019ll work to make it even stronger as Japan modernizes its security capabilities to address today\u2019s shared challenges. Ukraine is out of bullets and Russia is ramping up its attacks. Each day Speaker Johnson fails to bring Ukraine aid to the floor is a day Russia gets stronger, posing greater dangers to Ukraine, America, and our allies. I joined and our partners to celebrate the introduction of the Americas Act and discuss the importance of this bill for the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere. I look forward to continuing our work to pass this critical legislation. For decades, the U.S. has failed to offer a compelling alternative to China's investment in Latin America and the Caribbean. Today, the endorsed my and \u2019s Americas Act as critical to reasserting U.S. leadership in the region. I was glad to meet with Chancellor DiStefano and a group of inspiring student leaders this morning to learn more about the university\u2019s Center for Leadership and discuss how we can work together to support CU\u2019s students and faculty. Last week, I visited to see how Colorado\u2019s military installations are helping safeguard our national security.

Over a decade ago, Coloradans and I gathered together in Carbondale to continue our push to protect the Thompson Divide. My words are as true now as they were then. Together, we protected this treasured land for the next generation of Coloradans to enjoy. .\u2019s proposal to make common-sense oil and gas bonding reforms will save taxpayers money, protect our environment, and safeguard local communities. That's why I'm calling on to move quickly to finalize these long-overdue reforms. The U.S. has long worked with countries across the Indo-Pacific on shared security, economic & climate priorities. I was glad to visit the region with bipartisan colleagues last week to advance these priorities and underscore our strong commitment to our allies and partners. While meeting with South Korean President Yoon, we emphasized U.S. commitment to deterrence on the Korean Peninsula and the importance of cooperation with Japan. In Vietnam, we spoke with senior officials about our security priorities and economic collaboration. During our visit to the Philippines, we met President Marcos to discuss our growing defense and economic partnership and reaffirmed our commitment to the Philippines amid China\u2019s provocations in the South China Sea. Since its founding years ago, NATO has safeguarded transatlantic peace and proved itself as the most successful military alliance in history. As NATO welcomes new members and remains steadfast in its commitment to Ukraine, the alliance is stronger than ever. #WeAreNATO The deaths of seven workers in Gaza are tragic and preventable. My heart goes out to their families and the WCK community. This tragedy will make it even more challenging for critical aid to reach Gaza, with aid groups halting delivery because of the danger. Israel must immediately ensure that humanitarian workers can operate safely in Gaza, open more land crossings for aid, and speed up aid inspections. I\u2019ve fought for over a decade alongside Coloradans to protect the Thompson Divide & Mt. Emmons. I\u2019m pleased by \u2019s decision to protect this treasured landscape. Now, we must pass my CORE Act to make this withdrawal permanent and protect this land for generations to come. Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander women earn an average of just cents for every dollar paid to white men. Everyone deserves equal pay for equal work.

Our bipartisan bill will ensure kids fleeing violence and persecution are treated with the dignity and care they deserve.

From Ida Clark DePriest to Ellis Meredith, CO women have led the nation in the fight for liberty and human rights throughout history.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m again urging to fix the new FAFSA now. From helping build affordable housing for the Southern Ute Indian Tribe to making our highways safer for everyone, these investments will help Coloradans in La Plata County and across the state meet the changing needs of their communities. When I was in high school, I was a Senate page. I know firsthand the dedication it takes and I'm thankful for Alan's hard work. This week, I spoke with Colorado members, including Monument\u2019s Jackson Waters, the National Young Marine of the Year. I was glad to congratulate Jackson on this honor. I voted against this morning's appropriations legislation because it failed to include any financial support for Ukraine. If the Speaker puts Ukraine funding on the Floor, it will pass with a bipartisan vote. If he does not, he will have to explain why he lost Ukraine. Happy inaugural Pueblo Flag Day, Colorado! Today, we celebrate the history and culture of this incredible Colorado city. On the third anniversary of the King Soopers shooting in Boulder, I\u2019m thinking of the ten Coloradans whose lives were cut tragically short by a senseless act of gun violence. We can't accept this as a normal part of life. Congress must pass common-sense gun legislation now. DACA recipients face a barrage of legal challenges, and employment authorization delays are yet another hurdle in this uncertain process. Alongside Colorado lawmakers, I\u2019m calling on to swiftly address this issue for Dreamers across our state. Beneficiarios de DACA ya enfrentan bastantes retos legales.

That is unacceptable. As I said yesterday, the government funding package should include Ukraine aid. Democrats should reject it if it doesn\u2019t. Students from Commerce City\u2019s STEAD School visited Capitol Hill this week. I was glad to chat with these incredible young people about what I\u2019m working on and hear how their unique high school experience is preparing them for careers in agriculture, environment, and more. As long as I have known Leader Schumer, he has been the greatest friend to Israel, and I know he has reflected deeply on these matters as both a senator and a Jew. There are no prophets in our time. We don\u2019t know how or when this war will end. But we know that a two-state solution will be required for a peaceful and prosperous Middle East. Human history tells us that war often forms a hopeless, permanent state of things; and peace often requires more courage than war. I\u2019m grateful for Leader Schumer\u2019s courage and honesty. I'm glad we advanced this important legislation with bipartisan support. Modeled after my Rural Outdoor Investment Act with , this bill will have a special focus on supporting America's outdoor industries to create jobs and boost rural economies in CO and nationwide.

Everyone deserves to make their own reproductive choices free from government overreach or control. Glad to see the first ever Administration public event on marijuana reform. This is an important step in the right direction to begin undoing the devastation caused by the war on drugs.

He served our nation and had a distinguished career in law enforcement. My thoughts are with his family as they grieve this tragic loss. May we never forget his leadership, courage, and sacrifice. I\u2019m thinking of all my friends in Laconia tonight. This antisemitic vandalism is part of a surge in hateful attacks on the Jewish community across the country.

It\u2019s important that we celebrate diversity and ensure everyone is welcome in NH. There is no world in which terrorism is ever justified. I\u2019m beyond disappointed in Harvard\u2019s inadequate response to this hateful statement, and I strongly condemn the dangerous, antisemitic views of those blaming Israel for these horrific attacks. My thoughts are with the Israeli people as their country is experiencing horrific terrorist attacks from Hamas. The United States must continue to support our steadfast ally, and Israel must be able to defend itself and protect the safety of its people.

Thank you for your longstanding commitment to public service and your leadership in the state Senate. I\u2019m grateful for the families, advocates, and legislators who ensured the defeat of this harmful bill today. Our schools should be a safe space for all kids to learn, and pushing a national anti-LGBTQ political agenda on our local districts is not the NH way. #NHPolitics It\u2019s a beautiful day to knock doors for in Manchester! If you\u2019re a Ward voter, be sure to get out and support Maxine on Tuesday, May #NHPolitics I\u2019m grateful for the swift response from local officials and law enforcement at all levels to keep students and teachers safe. My thoughts remain with the Portsmouth community after the events of this week. The latest far-right assault on reproductive health is extreme and dangerous. We must continue to empower women, not judges or politicians, to make decisions about their health care. Congress can and must act to protect reproductive freedom. No parent should send their child to school and wonder if they'll survive. I stand with the students, teachers, and families in Nashville. But that's not enough. Congress must act to end these senseless acts of gun violence. The lives of our fellow Americans depend on it.

I stand with families across New Hampshire in opposition to these bills. The bipartisan work we've done in Congress to invest in our infrastructure and jumpstart domestic manufacturing is paying dividends for Granite Staters. This is good news, but more is needed. I'll keep working to deliver for New Hampshire. #NHPolitics This is welcome news but long overdue. Last year I helped lower the price of insulin for those on Medicare to and cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors.

Rochester will be well-served in Concord by Chuck, and I look forward to working with him to help ensure New Hampshire\u2019s communities, small businesses, and families succeed. #NHPolitics Hatred, racism, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in New Hampshire.

Two years ago today, I watched in horror with the world as a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to disrupt our free and fair democratic process. Today I remember and honor our brave first responders and recommit to never let the events of January happen again. Judy Reardon was a dear friend, a fierce advocate, and a leader and advisor who never shied away from fighting for what\u2019s right. She was simply one of a kind, and I\u2019ll miss her greatly. My heart goes out to Patty, Rik, and the entire family. New Hampshire first put the presidential nominating process in the hands of the people. Our primary gives every candidate a fair shake and ensures the process is driven by voters. #NHPolitics It is deeply disappointing that President Biden has decided to try to upend the presidential nominating calendar and remove New Hampshire from our position. As our law stipulates, New Hampshire will go first. #NHPolitics I will continue to work with state and party leaders to uphold our law and ensure our primary remains first on the calendar. The face-to-face conversations in living rooms, small businesses, and town halls across our state make better candidates. #NHPolitics I look forward to welcoming Democratic and Republican candidates to campaign in our state ahead of the Primary in #NHPolitics Love is love. Tonight we\u2019re a step closer to safeguarding the fundamental rights of people across this country to marry the person they love.

Ray was a dedicated public servant and strong advocate for Manchester as Mayor and Executive Councilor. My thoughts are with his family and all who knew him at this difficult time. The deadly attack on the LGBTQ+ community in Colorado Springs was heartbreaking and horrifying, and I join Americans in mourning the deaths of these individuals. We must all remain committed to fighting the hated and bigotry that caused this . & assembled an unprecedented grassroots effort for NH House Democrats that defied the odds and elected many new voices. I know this leadership team has what it takes to work across the aisle, stand for our values, and deliver results. #NHPolitics We have no more sacred obligation than the promise we make to those who served in uniform and swore to give everything - up to and including their lives - for this country. Today and every day, we offer our profound thanks and gratitude to New Hampshire\u2019s veterans. Good morning, New Hampshire! Last night we won a great victory because we put people over politics and listened to the voices of Granite Staters. There is so much more to do, and I\u2019ll always stay focused on solving problems the New Hampshire way. #NHPolitics Thank you, New Hampshire! You sent a clear and powerful message: Granite Staters want leaders in Congress who work together to find common purpose and use common sense.

Then, at despite grid operators sounding the alarms, the admin committed to phasing out coal power - threatening our electric grid even more. This is concerning. In order to meet demand & secure our grid, we must utilize coal power, an affordable & reliable energy source. I STRONGLY urge the Biden admin to rethink this commitment, as it is rushed, potentially dangerous, and will increase costs on the American people. Today, we come together to reflect on the many blessings God has given us this year. From my family to yours, happy Thanksgiving! Today, on Veteran\u2019s Day, we honor the brave men and women who took the oath to serve our great nation in uniform.

These volunteer leaders are fired up and ready to make history by passing the Arizona Abortion Access ballot initiative and restoring our constitutional rights. America must only move forward on civil rights. Anti-choice extremists have one more shot to enact a near-total abortion ban in Arizona. This is why we must pass the Arizona for Abortion Access ballot initiative next year\u2014and why I won't stop fighting to restore federal abortion protections in Congress.

My thoughts are with and the entire Pelosi family as they process and also recover from this assault. We are\u2014in real time\u2014witnessing an increase in dangerous, inciteful rhetoric from the extreme far right. They glorify the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol and call for its attackers to be released. They wink and nod as far right vigilantes intimidate Arizona voters. Many on the far right won't condemn today's attempted murder. Others will simply condemn violence in \"all forms.\" But let's be clear: Unless you're willing to stand up to those who engage in this rhetoric as it happens, you are not a part of the solution. You are the problem. We\u2019re knocking doors day in and day out to #GOTV. stopped by to help us reach every Arizonan across the state. days! Let\u2019s do this!

Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle East, and this Administration must make it clear that any attack on Israel will not be tolerated. Ever wonder why President Biden stopped touting Bidenomics? It's because he knows it's not working. It was an honor to hear Japanese Prime Minister Kishida address Congress. Japan is an essential ally, and at a time when Communist China and North Korea\u2019s aggression is on the rise, it is more important than ever to preserve this strong relationship between our two countries. Thanks to the for stopping by my office to discuss legislation that will build on the progress made in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s. There are over Minnesotans living with Alzheimer\u2019s, so I appreciate this group\u2019s work to advocate for them. The House just passed the EXPLORE Act, which I was proud to support because it will increase recreation opportunities & ensure our public lands remain accessible. This bill is critical to where activities like hunting, fishing, & snowmobiling are part of our way of life! Biden is slashing Medicare Advantage for million American seniors. This cut will impact nearly seniors living in costing them an extra per year. Devastating news for seniors who are already struggling under record-high inflation. Glad you feel safe - although I suspect that's because you have a security detail. What about the Americans who live in dangerous cities like DC and MSP who aren't afforded that same protection? Like this man who was attacked last night not far from the Capitol? I was honored to present Korean War veteran Bob Bergstrom w/the Ambassador for Peace Medal to recognize his brave service. Bob manned the radar on forty bombing runs during the Korean War, including the air battle known as Black Tuesday.

I had a blast with the staff and students at Hermantown Head Start earlier today. Their commitment to developing young minds is inspiring. I\u2019m proud to receive the PROMISE Award from for my commitment to supporting this critical program in Congress. Biden drained the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to artificially lower the high gas prices that his policies caused. Now, he's cancelling plans to refill it because of high prices. Energy security is national security, and thanks to Biden\u2019s failures, our country is less safe. \u201cAmericans are draining their retirement accounts, racking up debt due to high inflation.\u201d Bidenomics is failing the American people. I\u2019m hearing from landowners who are getting calls from Chinese companies that want to buy their land. We must protect our assets from CCP influence, which is why I\u2019m proud to back bills like the Prohibition of Agricultural Land for the People\u2019s Republic of China Act. Fallen NYPD officer Jonathan Diller was murdered by a criminal who had been released from jail times. What will it take for Democrat-run cities and states to start putting career criminals behind bars for good? When will they finally act to protect law enforcement officers? He is risen! From my family to yours, wishing you all a very happy and blessed Easter! For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John Wishing all who observe a blessed Good Friday. Yesterday I met w/resort owners who expressed concerns over efforts to put the Lake Sturgeon on the Endangered Species list. They are rightly concerned about the impact this could have on their business and local economy. Management of the Sturgeon should remain w/the state! Red Lake should remain open to ALL Minnesotans. Without protections for the public to access Red Lake - including protections for private property owners who have property around the lake - I do NOT support the land transfer proposed by the state legislature. Visited with students and faculty at Marquette Catholic School in Virginia, learned about the inspiring student-led housing projects with Habitat for Humanity in Hibbing, and met bright students from The Rock Co-Op in Chisholm. Proud to see the dedication of this next generation! Enjoyed lunch with Chisholm Mayor Adam Lantz at the Black Bear Bakery today. The food was excellent, and the staff were outstanding. It's local gems like these that make our community special. I'm concerned to hear about efforts to put Lake Sturgeon on the Endangered Species list. This could have consequences for our economy, cherished traditions, and the sturgeon. Management of the sturgeon MUST remain with the experts at the state level. On National Medal of Honor Day, we honor the brave Americans who have earned our nation\u2019s highest military honor. We will never forget these brave heroes who went above and beyond the call of duty. This is nothing less than an invasion. On World Down Syndrome Day, we celebrate the remarkable individuals living with Down syndrome, like my son Isaac. Isaac enriches our family beyond measure. He, like every individual with Down syndrome, is a precious gift to the world. It was a pleasure to speak to students from Ely Memorial High School on the Capitol steps! I love sharing this historic landmark with MN's next generation. Thanks to Jeff Anderson for coordinating this trip for the students. He and Frank Ivancich have been doing this since It was an honor to manage the House Floor today during the debate on two key energy bills. During Energy Week, is fighting to stop the President\u2019s anti-energy agenda and restore American energy AND mining dominance! I believe in consumer choice, and I know most families living in don\u2019t want an overpriced EV that is unreliable in cold climates. Minnesotans should have the right to decide what vehicle best fits their family\u2019s needs \u2013 not the federal government. If you weren't able to make it out to my gray wolf town hall in Forest Lake, you can still catch it online. My guest for this event, , does an excellent job providing a road map to achieving responsible wolf management. Watch the event HERE: Today on National Ag Day, we honor the hardworking farmers, ranchers, and producers who are the backbone of America. Your dedication feeds our nation and fuels our future. Let's continue to support and celebrate our agriculture community today and every day. #NationalAgDay My gray wolf town hall in Forest Lake is underway! I\u2019m honored to be joined by my colleague - who is a real leader on ESA issues in Congress. Together, we are working to delist the gray wolf! It\u2019s time for Governor Walz to do the right thing and take this case away from Mary Moriarty. She clearly has an anti-cop agenda. Great op-ed from my friend, Senator . I couldn't agree more- \"In this moment of crisis, Israel deserves our wholehearted support.\" Excellent news! is rich in natural resources! Today, I honored fallen Burnsville Police Officer Paul Elmstrand on the House Floor. Paul grew up in and I recently sat down with his parents to express my condolences over their loss. They described him as a family man with a servant\u2019s heart. He will be greatly missed. I'm calling on Mary Moriarty to resign in disgrace for this abuse of power. As a former law enforcement officer, I stand with Trooper Ryan Londregan and all of Minnesota\u2019s heroic law enforcement officers who have faced unfair treatment at the hands of DFL leaders. Come meet with my staff at our upcoming mobile office hours! Need help navigating the IRS, Social Security, Medicare, veterans\u2019 benefits, and other federal programs? We are here to serve you! It was wonderful catching up with in DC this past week. I\u2019m so grateful for the important work they do to assist Minnesota\u2019s veterans and their families! The state of our union is one of decline, but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. As I leave the Capitol with Biden\u2019s divisive words still ringing in my ears, I\u2019m hopeful that come November, the American people will send our country in a better direction. It\u2019s Laken Riley, Mr. President. Not Lincoln. We are nearly minutes into this #SOTU speech and Biden has still not mentioned the top issue on Americans' minds: the crisis at our southern border. Disgraceful. I\u2019m privileged to be joined at the State of the Union tonight by my guests, Hibbing Mayor Pete Hyduke and his son Brad! Laken Riley was murdered by an illegal alien who had been arrested for endangering a child and shoplifting, and then set free. Her death was preventable. I voted for the Laken Riley Act to require ICE to detain illegal aliens like Laken\u2019s murderer until they can be deported. President Biden likes to say that a wall at our southern border wouldn't work, but I bet he doesn't mind the wall that went up around the Capitol ahead of tonight's State of the Union address. It was an honor to deliver remarks at the Stanley Cup reception tonight! It\u2019s always a privilege to be in the same room as the greatest trophy in sports! The House just passed over million in funding for projects across I will always fight to bring federal dollars back to the Northland! Despite the national security threats, the Biden Administration has admitted to secretly flying as many as illegal immigrants into the United States to reduce the number of border crossings. This is insanity. Very powerful words from Sheriff Fletcher. These attacks on law enforcement must stop! And for that to happen, many of our state\u2019s leaders need to stop spewing the anti-cop rhetoric that has fueled public disrespect of law enforcement. The Supreme Court unanimously decided that the American people \u2013 not activist judges \u2013 should decide our nation\u2019s leaders. This is a major win for democracy! The gray wolf is fully recovered. Time to delist! Our nation is facing an unprecedented crime crisis. Yet, the President is still pushing this TERRIBLE bill that will defund the police, limit their ability to keep our communities safe, and put their own lives in more danger. While touting the taxpayer money they want to spend on housing and services for illegal immigrants, the White House referred to illegals as \u201cnewcomers.\u201d What a sick attempt to normalize this invasion. Make no mistake, Biden is NOT serious about stopping illegal immigration. Today, Minnesotans will come together to mourn the fallen Burnsville first responders who were killed in the line of duty. We will never forget the heroic service and sacrifice of Burnsville Police Officers Paul Elmstrand and Matthew Ruge and Adam Finseth. I traveled to the southern border to hear from folks on the front lines of the illegal immigration crisis. Watch the latest episode of \"Champions of Rural America\" to hear from the farmers, ranchers, and law enforcement officers impacted by this crisis: The dramatic increase in Minnesota\u2019s gray wolf population is harming hunters, farmers, and families alike. Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to participate in a town hall on the urgent need to delist the gray wolf and enact a responsible management plan at the state level. My heart breaks for Laken Riley & her family. A beautiful life cut short by an illegal immigrant who should have never been here in the first place. President Biden\u2019s open border policies cost this young woman her life, and continues to threaten the safety of all Americans. \"Do you believe in miracles? Yes!\" The Miracle on Ice took place years ago today. THE greatest sports moment of all time Yesterday, I visited a Twin Metals drill site. From examining core samples to chatting with drillers, it's clear: this project would bring an abundance of jobs and prosperity to the region. I am fully committed to seeing this project through. Grateful to the Pulsar Helium team for a fantastic tour of their Topaz Project drill site. Northeastern Minnesota is a treasure trove of spectacular natural resources. Proud to witness the incredible work being done right here in our backyard! Minnesotans DON'T want to live in a Sanctuary state. I along w/ , , & sent a letter to the Governor outlining the reasons we oppose the DFL's North STAR Act. It's not too late to stop from causing further harm to MN. Devastating news coming out of Burnsville this morning. My prayers are with the fallen officers and paramedic, their families, and the entire Burnsville community. This is a terribly sad reminder of the grave danger posed to our brave law enforcement officers. This week, the House stood up for American jobs and energy security by voting to overturn President Biden\u2019s ban on LNG exports. We must end the President\u2019s war on American energy! Not misguided jabs. USW failed to comment on the EPA rule that will close taconite plants in my district. steelworkers\u2019 jobs are at risk and their leadership in DC failed them. \u201cNorthern states see the highest record of border crossings as migrants take advantage of lax laws to get into Canada.\u201d The President\u2019s terrible policies have encouraged the invasion of our southern AND northern borders. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is a primary architect of the border crisis. Due to his inaction, illegal immigrants, deadly drugs, and terrorists have flooded across the southern border. Last night, I voted to impeach Mayorkas for refusing to enforce federal immigration laws. Welcome back to the House ! There was no better way to celebrate your return than indulging in some Mardi Gras King Cake. Thank you for the treat! Proud to be leading the effort to delist the gray wolf! This species is fully recovered and I will not stop fighting until responsible wolf management is achieved! I oppose the DFL's efforts to make MN a sanctuary state. Their proposal would allow illegals to receive all our state's resources, leaving Minnesotans w/nothing but the bill. Minnesotans don\u2019t want to live in a sanctuary state. They want border security! of the AZ border is federal land, which is being polluted by illegal immigrants. They leave behind trash, waste, and unattended campfires. This week, held a field hearing highlighting the environmental, economic, & security consequences of illegal immigration. This part of the border is where those who cannot claim asylum attempt to enter, often because of criminal convictions. We must complete the border wall to keep dangerous individuals from entering our country! Biden\u2019s policies have crippled border patrols\u2019 ability to keep communities safe. -Withdrew from the Remain in Mexico agreement. -Reinstated catch and release. -Halted construction of the border wall. The materials are ready, we must resume construction of the border wall! I\u2019m in Cochise County, AZ at the southern border with my colleagues to hear from border patrol and local law enforcement on the ongoing border crisis. They are telling us that it\u2019s not just an immigration issue, it\u2019s an organized crime issue. On National Girls and Women in Sports Day, we celebrate the incredible achievements of our female athletes and reaffirm our commitment to protecting their rights! Today, I am voting to protect Americans with disabilities and chronic health conditions from discrimination in healthcare. Every American deserves to receive quality care. Devastating news for the Northland. My heart goes out to the owners, staff, and all those who loved this special place. As tensions continue to rise in this unstable region, I will continue to pray for the safety of our American service members who are currently serving in harm's way. Biden\u2019s just announced no changes to the listing status of the gray wolf under the ESA. Since the Biden Admin won't do the right thing, Congress must act. That why I sent a letter to House leadership urging them to include delist language in the spending package. Here illegally and released without bail after beating up law enforcement officers. Only in Joe Biden\u2019s America\u2026 I voted to make illegals who have been convicted of a DUI deportable or inadmissible to the US. An important step, but it's crucial we prevent illegals from entering our country in the place. My Democrat colleagues need to get on the side of public safety & law enforcement. Today, a Department of the Interior official testified that the Biden Admin is in favor of increasing domestic mineral production. I couldn\u2019t let that comment slide. This Admin has killed just about every domestic mining project that has come before them, including here in MN. The IRS reached out to let me know their final decision on the Walz rebate disaster. Sadly, Minnesotans will still be federally taxed on their rebate checks bc the IRS couldn't overlook the careless mistakes made by the Governor and", "Just a reminder check out our morning show, CST on US FM.

Even Biden\u2019s own Sec Def agrees the left\u2019s claims are completely baseless. So why is the Biden administration actively undermining Israel\u2019s efforts to defeat Hamas? Why should those who didn\u2019t take out loans carry the burden for the education and financial decisions of others? This is a completely handout in exchange for votes this November. Up next, the forgiveness of your EV loan! Thanks to our advocacy and the advocacy of our persistent local officials, I\u2019m glad to see FEMA pause to reconsider this disastrous decision.

Welcome to the land of 'sanctuary cities' - a leftist fantasy where illegal immigrants roam free to commit crimes without consequences. This is all courtesy of Biden's open-border policies.

Thank you for passing my legislation out of committee today to prohibit men from competing in women\u2019s USA Olympic events. Every Democrat on committee voted against it.

The American people put Republicans in charge of the House because we promised to cut spending, we owe it to them to get it done. This isn't just about TikTok, it's about political power. Giving Biden's DOJ more authority to target speech they don\u2019t agree with right before the presidential election is a dangerous move. Joining on to discuss more. There is no doubt about it: TikTok is a dangerous app controlled by Chinese interests. However, that does not mean the bill in front of the House today is the appropriate solution to the national security threat TikTok imposes. (thread) If you think this hypothetical is far-fetched, I simply ask: what from the past years gives you any confidence that President Biden and the Democrats will not abuse this authority and weaponize it against conservatives? Why would we give Biden\u2019s DOJ more power to investigate someone they deem is under the control of a foreign person? This isn\u2019t about TikTok. It\u2019s about giving Biden\u2019s DOJ more power just months before their boss is on the ballot. This bill\u2019s language hands over the power to Biden and the left-wing radicals to determine if and/or Truth Social are \u201csubject to the direction or control\u201d of Russians, thus weaponizing the federal government against these companies without proving anything.

And once Robert Hur was appointed special counsel, what actions does the ghostwriter take? They eliminate the evidence. Biden, the mainstream media, and the radical left are more concerned about the fact that Biden called a murderer an \u201cillegal\u201d than they care about the woman he killed, or the fact that Biden has created the worst immigration and crime crises in our Nation\u2019s history.

The commercial space industry is continuing to take us to the moon, stars, and Great meeting the amazing women of the Pontiac and Southfield Alumnae Chapters of Delta Sigma Theta sorority! We discussed their mission of advocating for political, educational, social, and economic justice. I am grateful for their commitment to our community! It was great meeting with . We discussed the challenges facing our local communities and how Congress can better support cities efforts to build just and equitable futures for all. Glad to meet with the Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce of North America where we discussed the importance of strengthening U.S. Taiwan relations, ensuring peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, and enhancing trade between our nations. Good education starts with good educators. That\u2019s why I introduced the Addressing Teacher Shortages Act with , establishing competitive grants for schools to fund recruiting, retaining, and supporting teachers so every American kid has a shot at a bright future. Today I took to the floor in remembrance of Itay Chen, an soldier who died on October I\u2019d held out hope he was alive & held hostage and was devastated to learn he'd been killed. My heart is broken, we must stop the killing & bring all the hostages home. Happy day, Metro Detroit! Cheers to the city with the most heart, spirit, and determination! I\u2019m proud to be a Michigander today and every day. Thanks to \u2019 investing in America agenda, over million is being put towards 's efforts to research and better predict the Great Lakes\u2019 water levels - enabling coastal communities to better prepare & avoid the impacts of potential flooding! The President's budget invests in a better future for all drug & strengthening Social Security and clean energy for healthy the federal deficitMaking taxes fair Today the Bipartisan AI Task Force kicked off with a great conversation about harnessing AI & mitigating risk. Thanks to & for meeting the legislative challenge of AI head on - glad to be a part and excited to get to work!", "I'm glad to have the support of for my Ban Water Beads Act. These products are often sold as sensory toys for kids, but the truth is they pose a serious health risk and should not be marketed for children. I applaud for taking action to crack down on illegal gun sales & address the gun violence crisis. This rule expands background check requirements & is a huge step forward, but Congress still needs to pass new laws requiring a background check on EVERY gun sale or purchase. This is what Trump means when he says leave it up to the states. Women across the country are afraid to talk to their doctors about abortion medication because of Republican extremism. It\u2019s why we must restore Roe v. Wade's protections nationwide. Join me now for my weekly update! Met with students from . We spoke about the importance of federal student aid and the need to ensure funding for programs that allow young people to pursue opportunities in higher education. Joined to welcome from Armenia, Georgia, and Kazakhstan to our Capitol. As a fellow legislator, it\u2019s important to share our collective experiences and hear from others in the world who take on the mantle of representing constituents in a democracy. Unacceptable. These days, internet access isn\u2019t a luxury, it\u2019s a necessity. That\u2019s why we have a bill to renew funding for this vital program. needs to let us vote on the ACP Extension Act before million families are faced with unaffordable internet bills. Section was enacted years ago, when the internet was a very different place. Today in we discussed the need to reform Section which for too long has acted as a shield, allowing social media companies to avoid accountability for their decisions. Heartbreaking stories like this are why I've been sounding the alarming on Neptune's Fix. Its active ingredient, tianeptine, is illegal and not FDA approved. Gas stations and stores need to remove it from shelves immediately! Excellent speech by Japanese PM Kishida, who emphasized the importance of American leadership in the face of global challenges. As one of our closest allies, Japan will continue to be a reliable partner as we expand our cooperation and deepen the connection between our nations. Trump stacked the Supreme Court to repeal Roe v. Wade and wants states in charge of abortion. Now Arizona has restored an law that makes nearly all abortion care illegal. This is what the future of reproductive health care looks like under Republicans. I strongly condemn the desecration of the Rutgers Center for Islamic Life. Hateful attacks on faith-based community centers are never acceptable, but it's even more disturbing that the break-in occurred during Eid al-Fitr as Muslim students were celebrating the end of Ramadan. To all those celebrating Eid al-Fitr in New Jersey and around the world, Eid Mubarak! Nuclear reactor sites like the Oyster Creek site in New Jersey are now sitting dormant with nuclear waste stored on location. Today I advocated for the communities across the country that are home to spent nuclear fuel and in need of relocation solutions. Today held a hearing on patient access to telehealth services and care. I'm working to protect expanded access to high-quality care while also ensuring these new services do not undermine access to in-person care. PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d are toxic, dangerous & have absolutely no business being in Americans\u2019 drinking water. I\u2019m thrilled is tackling this crisis with strong, enforceable drinking water standards to protect Americans from these insidious chemicals. Today I joined Chair Rodgers to announce a hearing on bipartisan legislation to better protect Americans' data. I'm committed to putting Americans back in control of their information and protecting our children online. The Founding Fathers created a system of checks and balances to reign in authoritarians. Although the President has critical powers, they intentionally vested Congress with the most responsibility. Giving more power to the President over Congress is contrary to the constitution. PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d are toxic, dangerous, and have absolutely no business being in our drinking water. Enough is enough. I fought hard to ensure the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included billion to address PFAS contamination, but it\u2019s clear more must be done. Last Congress, my Committee led passage of the PFAS Action Act \u2013 comprehensive legislation that would address this crisis. But the Senate never took it up. We must take action, and I\u2019m determined to work with and all my colleagues until the job is done. I\u2019m glad the appeals court refused to allow petitioners to rewrite Clean Air Act history and derail the significant progress we\u2019ve made toward protecting Americans from dangerous air pollution. This was the only right & reasonable outcome, and Americans will be better off for it. I filed an amicus brief for this case last year, reminding the court that Congress has explicitly and repeatedly reaffirmed \u2019s authority to grant these waivers. Today\u2019s ruling is a win for our climate AND the rule of law. The is on a roll. Once implemented, this rule will reduce covered emissions by nearly For millions of Americans living near chemical plants, this is a game-changer. Another huge win for public health and protecting Americans from toxic, cancer-causing chemicals. The Kremlin is using online trolls to undermine U.S. support for Ukraine. This underscores why I'm working to pass legislation to prevent data brokers from selling sensitive information on Americans to our foreign adversaries who will use it against us. The CHIPS and Science Act is working \u2014 it's generating billions of dollars in investment that will create new, good-paying jobs right here at home while also strengthening our domestic manufacturing industry and our supply chains. Trump proudly claimed responsibility for the repeal of Roe v. Wade. The truth is Republicans will do everything they can to restrict women's reproductive health care rights. I'm proudly standing with Democrats in the fight to restore Roe's protections nationwide. Today's partial solar eclipse starts at in New Jersey and will end at about Peak darkness is expected to occur at Here are some tips: Enjoy the eclipse and be smartDon't stare at the sunWear certified eclipse glasses or solar viewers Our allies, specifically Japan, are rightfully concerned that Trump will dismantle the progress we've made to strengthen our partnerships. This week will be critical to solidifying the relationship between the U.S. and Japan - one of our most important allies in the Pacific. The Affordable Connectivity Program has been an incredible success \u2014 lowering the cost of monthly internet bills for millions of Americans. Unfortunately, House Republicans are playing political games and refusing to extend this vital program before it runs out of funding. . has already canceled more than billion in student loan debt despite the Supreme Court blocking his original plan. Utilizing his authority under the Higher Education Act will allow him to go further & provide more relief to even more borrowers. Our allies & partners, including Zelensky, are waiting anxiously for Congress to provide military assistance to Ukraine. They know that this decision is life or death for so many. needs to do the right thing & bring the security supplemental to the floor ASAP. There won\u2019t be peace in Gaza unless Egypt and Qatar, play an active role in facilitating it. They need to put pressure on Hamas to end the conflict. After that, they can work with other moderate Arab states to rebuild Gaza and get vital aid into the strip. Good too see that is urging China to reduce the overproduction of cheap technology that undermines the U.S. economy and to end any support Beijing provides to Russia as Putin continues his unprovoked war in Ukraine. The debate over Medicaid expansion highlights a key difference between Democrats & Republicans. While Red states refuse to expand Medicaid, Democrats are fighting to ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care. Another impressive jobs report! . is now the only president in American history to create MILLION new jobs. Wages continue to rise, and unemployment has been below for consecutive months. This is what a strong, growing economy looks like. I\u2019m grateful for recent pledges of financial support to Armenia from the Biden Administration and the European Union. This funding will help Armenia achieve independence and growth in its transportation, energy, and sectors. We still must do more to aid the people who were forced to flee their homeland because of Azerbaijan\u2019s genocidal campaign and address Armenia\u2019s dire need defend itself against a potential Azerbaijani attack. Read my full statement here: Proud to attend the naming and dedication ceremony of the new Marine fireboat in Perth Amboy. I helped secure in federal funding to purchase the fireboat plus an additional for maintenance of the city\u2019s four existing police boats. NATO was created in the wake of World War II to ensure global stability, promote democracy, and protect our shared values. years later, the alliance remains central to our national security and critical to our mission of creating a safer and more secure world. This is huge. I fought hard to enact the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund because it will save Americans money on their utility bills, create new good-paying jobs, and protect our communities from the climate crisis. I was in Bradley Beach today to talk about the federal funding I secured for Bradley Beach. The Borough will receive million to help support important pedestrian improvements that will make the Main Street safer and more accessible to residents and visitors. I\u2019m LIVE in Bradley Beach to highlight federal funding I secured to improve Main Street. Internet service is an indispensable part of American life, & it must be treated that way. I applaud for recognizing that reality, asserting its rightful authority over broadband providers, & taking action to protect Americans from unjust practices. More and more studies are finding harmful effects linked to e-cigarettes. Big Tobacco wants you to think they are benign and that's simply not true, which is why I've raised serious concerns about their aggressive marketing of vapes to young people. Thinking about all those in Taiwan affected by this terrible earthquake. Congress must be ready to support the White House in providing assistance to the island as they begin the recovery process. We know that vessel strikes and entanglements are the primary causes of marine mammal deaths and injuries. That's why I've called on to enforce the vessel speed rule so we can protect the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale and help the population rebound. It's been nearly months since the Senate passed a bipartisan security supplemental. As the fate of Ukraine hangs in the balance, the House cannot afford to delay taking up this critical legislation any longer. needs to bring it to the floor for a vote next week. This is outrageous. Social media companies are standing idly by while their platforms are used by foreign adversaries to spread dangerous disinformation & undermine our democracy. Platforms must prioritize responsibility over clicks. Spoke at the NJ Alliance for Action Middlesex County meeting about the impact of the Biden Infrastructure Law, which includes significant investments toward NJ infrastructure projects, including funds to fix our roads/bridges, remove lead pipes & expand broadband & clean energy. Republicans are criminalizing abortion care in Florida, and they won\u2019t stop there if they\u2019re successful. Voters have the power to reject this new draconian law in November as we continue the fight to restore Roe v. Wade\u2019s protections nationwide. Instead of hiring kids to work in unsafe environments, companies should be raising wages, improving conditions & hiring adults. It's deeply concerning that red-state Republicans care more about padding these companies' profits than protecting the health & safety of our children. Republicans were never going to be satisfied with just overturning Roe. They want to fully control women\u2019s bodies by instituting a complete abortion ban nationwide. That's why we need federal legislation to protect a woman's right to choose. These results are a warning to Erdogan that many people in Turkey are opposed to his authoritarian tendencies & efforts to dismantle Turkey's democracy. There remains a strong pro-democratic coalition in the country. I hope they can build on this momentum. If Russia wins in Ukraine, it will only embolden China to invade Taiwan. It's another reason why it's so critical to support Ukraine's defense. The U.S. must send a definitive message to Xi & Putin that they must respect the sovereignty of their neighbors. For years, the Endangered Species Act has protected vulnerable wildlife, & we cannot afford to go back now. I'm glad that the Biden Admin is restoring protections for threatened species that will help safeguard their habitats & restore their populations. . has already forgiven billions in student loans for borrowers across the country, & he\u2019s trying to do more. The only obstacle is Republican AGs who are opposing his efforts in court even though many of their constituents would benefit from his plan. We cannot allow China to dominate the clean energy transition. Democrats supported billion in investments in the Inflation Reduction Act to ensure we can compete. Republicans are now trying to repeal those investments. We cannot let that happen. We should be working to end inequality not attacking efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, but far too many Republicans have turned DEI into a vast conspiracy responsible for society\u2019s problems. It\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s completely absurd. .\u2019s new emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles will come with BILLION in benefits each year and cut pollution by BILLION metric tons. A big win for our climate and the million Americans who live near trucking routes and bear the burden of this pollution. Join me now for my weekly update! More great progress toward cutting dangerous methane pollution, which accounts for a THIRD of the worsening climate crisis. This rule will work well alongside my Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which ensures polluters are held accountable for their wasted methane. I helped lead House & Senate Democrats in filing an amicus brief with the Supreme Court affirming that federal law requires hospitals to provide emergency stabilizing care, including abortion care, when necessary regardless of a state's restrictions. I strongly support the Biden actions to crack down on junk short-term health insurance plans. These plans, which proliferated under the Trump Administration, discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. I held a press conference today in Edison to call for action to protect New Jerseyans from \u201cgas station heroin.\u201d I recently sent a series of letters about my concerns over the public health risks associated with increased ingestion of tianeptine, a purported dietary supplement. In these letters, I expressed concern over these products and similar ones may still be on stores shelves despite a voluntary recall, jeopardizing the health of our communities, particularly our kids. Read more here: I\u2019m LIVE in Edison to call for action to protect New Jerseyans from \u201cgas station heroin.\u201d I\u2019m deeply concerned about the public health risks of this so-called dietary supplement. Right-wing Congressional Republicans put politics over people & refuse to work across the aisle to get things done. It's no wonder so many Republicans are leaving Congress in droves. It will only get worse as Trump & the far-right continue to push the moderates out the door. Facility fees are leaving patients with large medical bills. I led the effort in Congress to protect patients against surprise medical bills & secured House passage of my Lower Costs, More Transparency Act which would help them better understand the cost of health care services. Attended the wake of Michael J. Cioffi, who passed away after a courageous battle with cancer & other related illnesses. Michael was a firefighter who rushed into NYC on Sept. & spent the next several months working through the rubble at the World Trade Center site. The Affordable Care Act has given millions of Americans coverage and benefits like pre-existing condition protections. I'm pushing to preserve and expand these benefits while also fighting against Republican efforts to repeal the law. It's clear Beijing will use every tool at their disposal to gain a strategic advantage. That's why I'm working to protect Americans' privacy & bolster national security with my bill to prevent data brokers from selling sensitive info to our adversaries. Access to internet service is meaningless if Americans can't afford their internet bills. Today I wrote to about the importance of having affordable internet options for American families \u2014 an essential part of getting every American online. The Supreme Court is hearing a case today that could undermine FDA's approval of mifepristone\u2014a safe and effective drug that has been on the market for years. I helped lead in an amicus brief urging SCOTUS to protect access to mifepristone. Glad to join in Aberdeen for the reauthorization of the Transportation Trust Fund. This new funding is a win for residents, workers, businesses, tourists, union members & anyone who uses our roads & rails. I\u2019ll keep fighting for federal funding so we can build on this. Wishing the Greek people & the Greek-American community all the best as they celebrate Greece's Independence Day. The U.S.-Greece relationship is strong & will continue to grow because of our shared values rooted in a commitment to freedom, democracy & human rights. It\u2019s outrageous that Republicans are allowing this critical program to collapse before our eyes. We can't allow their extreme agenda to risk over million American families' internet access \u2014 it's time to fund the ACP. Happy Holi to all who celebrate! May the Festival of Colors bring you happiness and positivity. I was in Long Branch today to celebrate the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to this landmark law, more Americans than ever have access to quality, affordable health care & millions of families have seen the cost of their monthly insurance premiums go down. Despite the progress we have made, extreme right-wing Republicans are still plotting to repeal the ACA. Make no mistake \u2013 I will stand side-by-side with Democrats in the fight to ensure the ACA is here to stay. I\u2019m LIVE in Long Branch to celebrate the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act! While Republicans continue to put polluters over people, EPA is pushing new vehicle standards that will ensure Americans breathe cleaner air, drivers spend less on fuel & climate pollution is dramatically slashed. This is the path forward. Visited the graves of my parents and ancestors this Palm Sunday. Nice sunny day for the Keansburg St. Patrick's Day parade. Aliyev has repeatedly cracked down on those who speak against his corrupt, anti-democratic regime. That\u2019s why I co-led H.Res. calling for the U.S. to hold him accountable and ensure the immediate release of Dr. Ibadoghlu and other political prisoners he unjustly detained. Wishing the Jewish community a happy Purim! Purim is a holiday that celebrates the saving of the Jewish people from annihilation by Haman, a royal official in the court of the Persian Empire. President Biden has canceled an additional billion in student loans for public service workers \u2014 including teachers, nurses and firefighters. The Biden Admin has now canceled a total of billion in loans for nearly four million borrowers. The Inflation Reduction Act was the biggest investment in climate action in American history \u2013 now it\u2019s growing our economy and helping us beat out our global competitors. Proof we don\u2019t need to choose between creating jobs and fighting the climate crisis. years ago, I stood beside President Obama as he signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Today, more than million Americans have health care coverage as a result. We've come a long way and we're not going back. I'll always stand up to protect Americans' health care. I proudly joined a bipartisan resolution sending our best wishes to Greece as they celebrate their Independence Day. I'm working to ensure the partnership between our nations remains strong so that both the U.S. and Greece can continue to benefit from our friendship. I strongly support \u2019s work to protect families and raise awareness about the dangers of water beads as I work to pass legislation in Congress to ban these products from being marketed for kids. I\u2019m proud to announce that I\u2019ve secured over to support renovations and upgrades to Carteret\u2019s emergency response facilities. This funding will help give first responders the resources they need to respond to emergencies quickly and efficiently. Today I fought Republicans\u2019 shameless bill to REPEAL two landmark Inflation Reduction Act programs that drive down pollution, lower energy bills, and invest directly in our communities. This bill is nothing but a giveaway to Republicans\u2019 corporate polluter friends. Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act has already created more than new good-paying clean energy jobs right here at home. More than HALF of these jobs & projects are in districts represented by Republicans, who are right now fighting to take them away. It\u2019s unconscionable. Join me now for my weekly update! A new report from confirms what we have all grocery prices are due to corporate greed. Report finds large companies sought to use the disruptions of the pandemic to protect their market share and maximize profits at the expense of American families. Met with Yashi Srivastava, a Rutgers student and a Youth Board Liaison for . We spoke about efforts to remove menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars from store shelves and the urgent need to address the youth tobacco epidemic. House Republicans are presiding over the least productive Congress since the Great Depression. Today I highlighted their inability to govern as they brought a meaningless energy resolution to the floor. Reports of sexual abuse in organized sports are unfortunately not rare, and the organizations responsible for seeking justice have often failed survivors. Today we looked at ways to improve SafeSport, a group tasked by Congress to help prevent and address sexual abuse in sports. Many Americans don't know that the diagnostic tests patients and doctors rely on are not FDA-approved. This simply doesn't make sense. Today is holding a hearing on ensuring laboratory developed tests are accurate and reliable. The CHIPS and Science Act is working! I helped lead the effort in Congress to make this investment in American manufacturing in order to create good-paying jobs right here at home while also strengthening our supply chains. I'm glad to see leading manufacturers capping the price of inhalers at per month\u2014hopefully other manufacturers will quickly follow suit. Much like insulin, no one should ever have to choose between a lifesaving inhaler and putting food on the table. The House just unanimously passed my bipartisan legislation to protect Americans' data and safeguard our national security by prohibiting data brokers from selling sensitive personal information to our foreign adversaries. More details here Today is finalizing the most ambitious vehicle emissions standards in American history \u2013 a historic win for Americans\u2019 health and climate. I\u2019m thrilled is taking such ambitious action to simultaneously lower costs for drivers and protect Americans\u2019 right to clean air. These new vehicle emissions standards will also ensure the U.S. leads the world in motor vehicles, supporting American manufacturing and good-paying jobs in the process. This is what beating out our economic competitors looks like. More here: . is marking up bills today. While some are partisan and stand no chance at becoming law, others have strong bipartisan support including my HEARTS Act, which is intended to help prevent future deaths from cardiac arrest during high school sporting events. Today the House is considering my bipartisan bill to prohibit data brokers from selling Americans\u2019 sensitive personal information to our foreign adversaries who can use that data to exploit individual privacy and undermine national security. This heartbreaking story underscores why we need a comprehensive long-term care program in the United States. No one should lose their home to care for a loved one. Pleased to see in Yerevan reaffirming 's partnership with Armenia & its recognition of Armenia's territorial integrity. We must keep working to strengthen this relationship, increase cooperation between Armenia & the West, & bring stability to the Caucasus. I strongly support the Biden efforts to expand women's health research. This effort, led by , builds on the work we've done in Congress to improve diversity in health research, including in clinical trials. Good news: EV prices are coming down & are projected to KEEP coming down. Congress has made historic investments in EV infrastructure & tax credits to help facilitate the transition to these vehicles as we work together to build a cleaner, stronger future. I am thrilled that today \u2013 after decades of frustration, sickness, and loss \u2013 asbestos is finally set to be banned in the United States. Kudos to for using the tools Congress gave it in the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act to ban ongoing uses of this deadly chemical. I helped author this legislation, which honors New Jersey\u2019s late Senator Lautenberg, to make sure EPA has the tools it needs to protect Americans from toxic substances like asbestos. Today\u2019s announcement is decades in the making. Read my full statement I\u2019m proud to announce that I\u2019ve secured million for Woodbridge. This funding will allow Woodbridge to repair walkways and construct new ones so that residents have safe and easy access to the waterfront, local and county parks, and the marina. I\u2019m LIVE in Woodbridge to talk about the federal funding I secured for the Township and how it will help it revitalize the Sewaren Waterfront Walkway and surrounding area. Biggest crowd I\u2019ve ever seen for the South Amboy St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade. Everyone enjoyed the day which was luckily on St. Patrick\u2019s Day this year. This unfortunate decision from the Fifth Circuit lets corporate polluters off the hook. Confronting the climate crisis means working together \u2014 not dodging responsibility and prioritizing profits over people. It\u2019s good news that Armenia is looking to increase cooperation with the west and is considering joining the European Union. It\u2019s another reason why the United States must strengthen our relations and support them as they continue working to build their country and democracy. Republicans have no plan to lower costs for Americans. Instead they want to lower taxes for the wealthy & big corporations & cut Social Security, Medicare, & Medicaid benefits for seniors. It\u2019s cruel & it\u2019s wrong. I stand strongly against these efforts. I'm working to lower costs for Americans across the board, including health care costs. I\u2019m leading this bipartisan legislation to lower costs for consumers and help them better understand the cost of health care services This is exactly why the Methane Emissions Reduction Program is so critical. The Program \u2013 part of Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 curbs methane leaks from the oil and gas industry and ensures polluters, not consumers, pay for their wasted methane. Leaked & intentionally wasted natural gas never makes it to customers, but they're nevertheless stuck with the bill. I fought for the Methane Emissions Reduction Program because it puts that to an end, ensuring Americans no longer pay for wasted energy or the harm it causes. Republicans know that young people support Democrats' efforts to combat climate change, protect reproductive freedom & address gun violence. But instead of changing their unpopular positions, Republicans are passing extreme laws to disenfranchise students. Make no mistake Republican officials will not stop at a nationwide ban on abortion, they are already restricting families' ability to access IVF treatment. The only way this stops is if Democrats are empowered to restore Roe v. Wade's protections. Great meeting yesterday with Col. Alexander Young and the U.S. Army Corps. We discussed the status of ongoing projects in my district, including beach replenishment, flood control, and dredging. I commend the Biden Admin for sending an additional million in weapons to Ukraine, but this is not a long-term solution. Congress needs to provide Ukraine with additional security resources to defend their country and democracy. Any further delays will only embolden Putin. Poison control centers are reporting major increases in calls related to tianeptine, often sold as Neptune\u2019s Fix or known by the nickname \u201cgas station heroin.\u201d I\u2019m calling for urgent action to prevent further harm. For far too long, this toxic chemical has plagued frontline communities across the country. I applaud for tackling this crisis head on and making good on its mission to protect public health \u2013 all while ensuring we maintain critical medical supplies. I\u2019m proud to announce that I\u2019ve secured for South Amboy. This funding will help complete important infrastructure projects at the ferry terminal, waterfront bulkheads, a seawall, access roadways, sidewalks, parking, and a pavilion. I signed onto a discharge petition that would bring the national security supplemental to the House Floor despite 's ongoing efforts to block humanitarian assistance & critical aid to Ukraine, Israel & Taiwan. The world is watching and we cannot delay any further. I\u2019m proud to announce that I\u2019ve secured for . This funding will support the university\u2019s research on coastal resilience and climate change as well as bolster its mission to expand marine science to students with diverse backgrounds. We know our foreign adversaries are using invasive surveillance practices on social media to gain access to Americans' data and conduct espionage activities. Today, the House voted on legislation to protect Americans' sensitive information as well as our national security. I join and human rights advocates in calling for the U.S. to hold Aliyev accountable for his genocidal actions against Artsakh's Armenian population. It is past time Congress takes action to sanction his regime and prevent any further security assistance to Azerbaijan. This is outrageous and underscores why I\u2019m fighting to pass bipartisan legislation to protect Americans' data and privacy. Communications networks play a vital role in our economy and allow Americans easier access to doctors, teachers, and job opportunities. Today marked up legislation to protect Americans and our networks from foreign adversaries and bad actors. #EqualPayDay represents the day that women's wages catch up to what men were paid in the previous year. It's a reminder that despite our progress, women still make only cents for every dollar men make. Congress needs to pass legislation to ensure equal pay for equal work. Today is voting on public health bills, the vast majority of them bipartisan, including my HEARTS Act, which I introduced after two New Jersey families each tragically lost a child to sudden cardiac arrest. The bill aims to help prevent similar tragedies. Democrats passed legislation to lower drug prices and we will not allow Big Pharma to take us backward. The Inflation Reduction Act is the law of the land and prioritizes the American people over corporate profits. Budgets are more than numbers and dollars \u2013 they are an expression of priorities, choices, and values. I applaud for proposing a budget that makes good on his commitment to grow the middle class from the bottom up and move our country forward. I\u2019m proud to announce that I\u2019ve secured nearly million for Sayreville. This funding will allow the Borough to reconstruct the sewer pumping station so it can withstand major flooding events. This is just another example of how conservatives will stop at nothing to end programs that help ensure our schools reflect our country\u2019s diversity. The United States is a better country when we support diversity and work to end inequality. #RamadanMubarak to the Muslim community in New Jersey and everyone celebrating around the world. May this month bring you joy, peace and meaningful reflection. Erdogan's endorsement of Hamas shouldn't surprise anyone. Erdogan must be held accountable for Turkey's ongoing support of Hamas and other terrorist organizations and for his unacceptable antisemetic rhetoric, which will only worsen the situation in the region. Internet access is a necessity and the Affordable Connectivity Program has been a game changer for those struggling with rising costs \u2014 including one in ten New Jerseyans. Congress must extend funding for this critical program ASAP. The historic climate investments we made in the Inflation Reduction Act are growing our economy, lowering energy costs for families and combating the worsening climate crisis. is right \u2014 we must continue battling this crisis not denying it. Celebrated Irish pride at the Woodbridge St. Patrick's Day Parade. Wonderful preview of the Long Branch Fire History Museum with Artie Green, Mayor Pallone and Assemblywoman Peterpaul. The collection of historic firefighting equipment is unparalleled. The new museum will be a welcome addition to the city. We are in a race to the top in terms of who will have the strongest economy in the Century. Democrats are fighting for clean energy investments because we\u2019re determined to win. House Republicans are fighting to revoke those investments because they don\u2019t want to compete. Alternative headline: \u201cWhile the Biden Admin fights to protect Americans\u2019 lives, Republicans are fighting to protect corporate polluters\u2019 profits.\u201d Air pollution doesn\u2019t stop at state lines. Period. This is another example of the endless fees consumers are being unfairly charged for live events & why I\u2019m working to bring transparency & fairness to the live event ticket market. Consumers should be able to enjoy live music without fear of hidden fees. Another troubling development in the worsening climate crisis. Democrats are fighting it by investing in homegrown clean energy and American manufacturing, creating new good paying jobs to grow our middle class. Republicans are fighting to take these investments away. On and throughout Women's History Month, we recognize women's achievements and the contributions they have made throughout American history. Today we also honor the courageous women who have dedicated their lives to the fight for equality. Unfortunately, Republicans are threatening to turn back the clock and roll back the rights and reproductive freedoms that we've fought for generations to secure. We must do everything we can to protect women's freedom to make their own decisions about health care. Joined this morning to discuss 's #SOTU health care agenda, its stark contrast to Republicans' vision for repealing & restricting health care, and Democrats\u2019 commitment to expanding access to health care and lowering Rx drug costs. The United States stands firmly with our allies against Putin\u2019s unprovoked and murderous invasion of Ukraine. It\u2019s past time for House Republicans to support funding for Ukraine\u2019s defense of its territory and sovereign democracy. Thanks to President Biden\u2019s leadership, we\u2019re building an economy that works for everyone & lowering costs for families. I look forward to working with the President & his Administration to build on this progress & ensure we live up to the ideals on which our country was founded. We heard directly from tonight about the historic progress we\u2019ve made to build a better America for everyone by making health care & Rx drug costs affordable, defending women\u2019s reproductive freedom, rebuilding our infrastructure, and creating good-paying jobs. #SOTU We\u2019ve also taken action to fight the climate crisis. The Inflation Reduction Act became the single-largest investment in climate action in American history. In just over a year, these investments have shown we can act on climate while new, good-paying jobs right here at home. We\u2019re not done yet either. I\u2019ve introduced legislation to increase the number of prescription drug prices negotiated by Medicare each year and to extend inflation rebates to the private health insurance market to protect Americans against unfair price hikes by Big Pharma. As a result, Medicare is now actively negotiating lower drug prices, the price of insulin has been capped at per month, and starting next year seniors\u2019 out-of-pocket costs on Rx drugs will be capped at no more than a year. I join in celebrating the historic number of Americans who have signed up for quality, affordable health care coverage through the ACA marketplace. We\u2019re also holding Big Pharma accountable and reining in the cost of Rx drugs. Happy to welcome Luis Acosta to Washington as my guest for ' #SOTU tonight. Luis is a Perth Amboy resident, who participates in a local community solar program. His story shows the progress we\u2019ve made to both combat the climate crisis and lower costs for American families. Today voted on two bills to protect Americans\u2019 data and our national security. The markup includes my bipartisan bill to prohibit data brokers from selling, transferring or giving access to data to foreign adversaries or those controlled by them. Foreign adversaries are using invasive surveillance practices on social media to gain access to Americans' data to disrupt our lives and conduct espionage activities. Today we're discussing potential solutions that aim to protect Americans' data and our national security. Middlesex County is utilizing a new tool to help first responders. The Special Needs Registry, which launches March is a voluntary program that provides first responders with info to better respond to emergencies involving people with disabilities. I\u2019m pleased we were able to get these projects across the finish line in the House and look forward to seeing President Biden sign the underlying legislation into law. Read more about the projects in Middlesex and Monmouth Counties here. I\u2019m proud that I secured over million in funding for projects in my district in a federal spending bill that passed the House today. They will help rebuild & repair infrastructure, support low emissions public transit & lead pipe removal, and improve coastal resiliency. Once again, Republicans are putting corporate polluters over people with a bill that alters the fundamental premise of the Clean Air Act. By obstructing \u2019s ability to protect Americans from dangerous air pollution, this bill endangers Americans\u2019 lives. I won\u2019t allow it. A vote for Republicans\u2019 partisan pipelines bill is a vote to make our pipelines more dangerous. Demanding the federal gov regulate more pipelines with less money is a recipe for pipeline disaster \u2013 not safety. Today I\u2019m fighting this and other GOP energy bills. Republicans\u2019 legislation obstructing efficiency standards for household appliances will raise Americans\u2019 energy bills. The Biden Admin\u2019s energy efficiency actions will save Americans BILLION over years. That\u2019s significant savings, which Republicans are working against. I\u2019m proud to have Luis Acosta join me for President Biden\u2019s State of the Union Address tomorrow. His family saves an estimated per year on his electricity bill thanks to a community solar program with New Jersey-based . His story is a great example of the progress we\u2019ve made to both combat the climate crisis and lower costs for American families. Thanks to companies like , New Jersey is leading the way on the path toward a clean, low-carbon future. Congratulations to Carteret High School student Kiara Salva, who was recently recognized as \"Artist of the Week\" by Artsonia, the world's largest collection of student art! Yesterday, I called for action to eliminate hidden and misleading junk fees for Americans. So it's good to see that CFPB announced a new rule that will save Americans more than billion in credit card late fees annually & will reduce the typical fee from to The end of COVID-era Medicaid enrollment protections has underscored the challenges families face enrolling in and keeping their health care coverage. Today I asked to ensure all states commit to a public plan for complying with federal Medicaid & CHIP eligibility rules. I introduced bipartisan legislation to prevent data brokers from selling Americans\u2019 sensitive data to China and other foreign adversaries or entities controlled by them. We must stop allowing data brokers to freely sell treasure troves of data on Americans to our adversaries. It's never been easier to check the status of auto safety recall alerts. All you need to do is plug in your license plate number here I\u2019m proud to join the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\u2019s official redesignation as a Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our country depends on the world-class research & treatment scientists are conducting in New Jersey, which is why I fought for this redesignation. Thanks to this important redesignation, millions of dollars in federal investments will ensure Rutgers remains a national leader in cancer research and can develop new tools to better prevent, diagnose, and treat this terrible disease. When SCOTUS watered-down the Voting Rights Act, it enabled Republican states to pass discriminatory laws that make it harder for black Americans to vote. Congress must pass legislation to reimplement the VRA's protections & address the racial turnout gap. Local Social Security Administration Field Offices & the SSA workers nationwide are essential to helping recipients access their benefits. Thank you for advocating for a much-needed increase in federal funding to support staffing in SSA offices! The Biden Administration is working hard to deliver on the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act by negotiating lower prescription drug costs for seniors. Price negotiations will continue through the summer and the new lower prices will go into effect in Great discussion with local union leaders at my Labor Advisory Committee meeting. I emphasized that the Biden Admin has pushed a strong agenda & that we're finally reaping the benefits of historic investments in American infrastructure and domestic manufacturing. I called for Congressional action today to eliminate hidden and misleading junk fees and lower costs for American families. Consumers should be able to enjoy live music or plan a vacation without fear of hidden fees that can unexpectedly break the bank. While the Biden Admin\u2019s actions last fall will bring much needed transparency to the live event, car rental, hotel, and banking industries, it\u2019s past time to take legislative action and end this deceptive practice that unfairly raises prices on consumers. I\u2019m LIVE in Red Bank to call for Congressional action to eliminate hidden and misleading junk fees and lower costs for American families. These fees have little or no value to the consumer and are ripping off the American people. If Putin wins, Ukraine will effectively become a satellite state of Russia, and he won\u2019t stop there. We cannot allow that to happen. The U.S. must provide Ukraine with additional resources so they can continue to defend their country and democracy. This new report shows that global emissions continue to rise despite a decrease in U.S. emissions. The Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s climate investments are paying dividends here at home, but we need global leadership and cooperation to address this crisis. I\u2019m pleased to announce we\u2019ve reached a bipartisan agreement to increase funding for Community Health Centers and important new funding for Teaching Health Centers + the Public Health Service Corps until December Marched with Lake Como elected officials during the Belmar/Lake Como annual St. Patrick's Day.

Very pleased is acting to better protect our communities from chemical incidents. This rule makes progress on safer alternatives for high risk facilities and rightly emphasizes climate resiliency. Our workers and communities deserve to feel safe & this will go a long way. Coastal communities on the Jersey Shore are feeling the direct impacts of the climate crisis. We have to continue investing in fossil fuel alternatives that will reduce emissions, help us meet our climate goals, and put us on a path to a clean energy future", "Couple things from clip: Chair of Intel Committee should know #FISA legislation cold & shouldn\u2019t need to look repeatedly for help from staffer. wouldn\u2019t be doing that if he were chair.

RIP, Jim. Did #Trump read decision? Everyone should. Decision favored parents who were using #IVF; clinic is alleged to have negligently allowed the offspring to die. Per occurrence in opinion, IVF in USA is \u201cWild West.\" Lots of headlines about ruling involving #IVF. I just read the opinion. Court actually ruled in favor of the IVF parents, who alleged clinic negligently allowed their embryos to be destroyed. Would critics deny parents right to recover? I guess #JFK a Christian Nationalist. In his inaugural address, Kennedy said: \u201c...the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue...the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\" On October Hamas invaded #Israel & slaughtered innocent Iraelis. Hamas\u2019 standard procedure is to hide behind it Palestinian civilians & the work the IDF in Gaza since Oct has shown this. Hamas is responsible for every single civilian death in Gaza. No just and compassionate society would use taxpayer funds to kill the offspring of its economically distressed citizens. So PA Supreme Ct ignores the most fundamental right of all: the right to life. This right doesn't come from the generosity of the state or court. As our Declaration of Independence recognizes: it comes from a Creator & it is inalienable. Abortion involves the killing of an innocent human being. That is a painful but fact. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201cI tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just and that his justice can not sleep forever.\" . buys into the philosophy of \u201clives not worth living\u201d when his administration honors the intentional killing of a handicapped child.

You would think that any Republican who has previously questioned \u2019s mental capacity and has endorsed Trump might be reconsidering that endorsement. This is just the latest lapse by the former President.

He fires FBI Director and other personnel who abuse Americans\u2019 rights. . at town hall: If Trump is nominee, election is about Trump & his issues. And Trump will struggle in the swing states, just as he has since after his narrow wins in those states in The election needs to be about the future, not the past. . at town hall: Donald Trump is running on his issues, Nikki Haley is running on her donors\u2019 issues, Only DeSantis is running on the American people\u2019s issues.

Time for a new generation of leadership. Listen to in this clip & you\u2019ll see why Wall Street donor class is funneling tens of millions through a super PAC to attack him. And why so many members of Congress, inc. those pushing this deal, are for Trump. Desantis will stop this. Aaaannnnd\u2026.. Another packed house for \u2066\u2069 in #Iowa. It\u2019s clear corporate Street elites are trying to knock DeSantis out. Looks like these jam packed events have a different story to tell. American Renewal can begin in Iowa. The entire #PA congressional delegation needs to act to stop \u2019s ideological erasure of our history\u2026. Packed house, enthusiastic crowd for \u2066\u2069 in #Iowa.

That\u2019s Ron DeSantis. \u2066.\u2066\u2069 pounding it out for \u2066\u2069 in #Iowa. Pretty clear from Tom talking about Ron\u2019s early days in Congress that Ron hasn\u2019t changed. He\u2019s the conservative he\u2019s always been. In other words, he doesn\u2019t have multiple personalities. Of course Biff would never take responsibility. Somehow, it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault. But #Trump put Fauci in charge. He appointed Wray to run FBI & General \u201cwhite rage\u201d Milley to chair joint chiefs. He signed bills adding trillions to debt. Time for How many personalities does have? So she has an #Iowa personality & a New Hampshire personality. Wonder what her PA personality is. doesn\u2019t have that problem. His personality of leadership made FL succeed and will make #USA succeed. Oh good grief. Easy and obvious answer: Republicans have been losing elections in #PA, #MI, #WI, #AZ & #GA since There is nothing to suggest that will change if Trump is the #GOP nominee in Without the swing states, Republicans will win the White House. There is another way. Time & again, blows up the corporate #narrative. Whether on #COVID, parents\u2019 rights, #woke indoctrination, DeSantis always brings the facts. He's the narrative slayer. Get ready for another narrative to fall. #IowaCaucus When & I were sworn into Congress in Jan the national debt was an already staggering trillion. We consistently objected to the overspending then & in I suggest maybe Trump as president would veto Congress\u2019 overspending. Trump never did.

You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations, but you can\u2019t take the United Nations out of the ambassador.

They said that they were going to hold these agencies accountable. Instead, they\u2019re funding the status quo\u2026 Nikki Haley is disparaging the Iowa Caucuses and insulting you. I will always defend Iowa\u2019s values of faith, family, and freedom. While Donald Trump is focused on himself and Haley is focused on big donors, I hope to earn your support on January \u2014 I won\u2019t let you down! Instead of building the wall like he promised, Donald Trump caved to the very Swamp he once denounced \u2014 trying to ram through amnesty for million illegal aliens. I will finally stop the invasion and secure our border once and for all. How do you flip-flop on something like the sanctity of life? We don\u2019t want the election to be a referendum on Trump and the past. We want it to be a referendum on Biden\u2019s failures and our positive vision for the country. I offer that. I want to eliminate the IRS. Young people who are working hard and doing everything right are falling behind. It\u2019s almost to raise kids in this economy. That\u2019s taking the American Dream away. We need to restore the American Dream \u2014 and it starts with getting this fiscal house in order. This is what it looks like to have no core convictions. It was disrespectful for Nikki Haley to say that Iowans\u2019 votes need to be \"corrected.\" Haley thinks she is above hardworking Iowans. I'm proud to have visited all Iowa counties and to have met so many great Iowans along the way. Don\u2019t take anything for granted.

We can't let the Senate ram a clean reauthorization down our throats, which is why I voted to begin debate yesterday on the RISA Act and reform our broken system. A citizenship question on the U.S. Census should be a no brainer. Democrats should not be making this controversial. In FY alone, Chinese nationals have tried to illegally cross our southern border. This national security threat will continue so long as Biden refuses to reinstate Trump's Remain in Mexico policy. Prices are up a cumulative since Biden took office. Who exactly is Bidenomics supposed to help? Bear in mind that Biden has waited almost to do this. Don't be fooled by his election year change of heart, he owns the crisis at our southern border. Fact check: Democrats had control of both chambers for Biden's first two years and did NOTHING to stop the crisis at our southern border. Republicans passed the Secure the Border Act, HR last May and it still sits on Chuck Schumer's desk--they are the roadblock! CC: Hunter Biden Your dollar just doesn't go as far as it used to thanks to #Bidenomics. Illegal immigration to Texas is down in recent months thanks to our state's actions to secure our border with Mexico. When will Joe Biden put Americans' safety first and learn from what the Lone Star State has done? How many times is he going to try this illegal, vote-buying scheme? Biden's selling out our ally Israel because he's worried about losing support from the radical left. Where are the adults in the room in Joe Biden's White House? Whether it be China, Iran, or Russia, the Biden admin's weakness on the world stage has emboldened our adversaries. Biden's foreign policy legacy of failure! Many of them are military age males. Any competent president would recognize this as the national security threat it is. A depleted SPR is a dire national security threat, particularly when our adversaries are emboldened by Biden's foreign policy legacy of failure. Surely this was the most pressing issue facing the State Department! Joe Biden could simply reinstitute Trump's Remain in Mexico policy at any time. He's just chosen not to. Sec. Mayorkas has violated the law. He has failed in his duties and he lied to Congress when he said our border is secure. It\u2019s up to the Senate now to hold him accountable for his handling of the border crisis he helped create. In their sworn testimony, Bobulinski and Galanis told us: The Bidens didn't peddle any legitimate good or service, they sold the Biden Brand. Hunter committed perjury during his deposition. Joe Biden himself was involved in Hunter's foreign business dealings. Border Patrol officials have made clear that reinstating Trump's Remain in Mexico policy would reduce the flood of illegal crossings by Biden won't do this because he's beholden to the far-left, open borders wing of the Democratic party. Imagine turning your back on one of America's greatest allies because you're so worried about your polling in swing states. That's what Biden's doing to Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East. By refusing to have Israel's back in its fight against genocidal Hamas terrorists, Biden's sending a bad message to our allies around the world: You can no longer trust America. Seems like Biden told Hur another one of his famously contrived stories. And we're supposed to take him at face value when he says he never spoke to Hunter about his business dealings? Illegal aliens overrunning TX National Guard, trying to enter the country... ..And Biden is suing to stop our state from stopping this invasion? A carbon tax increases the price of energy which makes manufacturing and transportation even more expensive. Prices have already risen under Biden's policies. Americans deserve relief, not higher costs. It's not by accident, it's intentional. Biden doesn't care about the safety of Americans. Are we really supposed to believe Hunter Biden was hired by Burisma for his business acumen? All the evidence tells us he was hired for one reason: His dad, then-VP Joe Biden. Hunter was selling the Biden brand. Democrats have no substance to back their claims. All they can do is distract. Why are they so afraid of the truth? Why doesn't Hunter want to testify publicly? What does he have to hide? The world is less safe with Joe Biden in the White House. The Biden admin wants to put more Americans at risk. This is a victory for public safety. million illegal encounters under Joe Biden--that's an invasion! Texas should every right to defend itself and its citizens by making illegal immigration a state crime. Biden's war on American energy has taken away our leverage on the world stage. The world is much more dangerous and much less free when we handicap our energy sector. Biden's misery agenda... We must counter the CCP's asymmetrical warfare. It is our duty on to ensure federal agencies are doing everything possible to combat Communist China's influence. I say again: Why is Biden granting sanctions relief to Iran while its proxies aim to kill US personnel? Does Biden want to fund terrorism or does it it want to protect our troops abroad? Another chapter in the Biden foreign policy legacy of disgrace! Why doesn\u2019t Hunter Biden want a public hearing? The Chinese Communist Party uses TikTok to spy on Americans and push its propaganda. This is a clear national security threat. The bill the House will vote on today would force TikTok to divest from its CCP-owned parent company or face a ban. Joe Biden's budget would see in tax hikes per American family. As if groceries and gas weren't already expensive enough thanks to Bidenomics! Millions of Americans want to quit smoking. The Biden FDA shouldn't ban or slow-walk smoke-free alternatives that allow them to do so. I'm proud to join 's letter urging the FDA to let Americans choose how they quit. Iran is funding terrorist groups that aim to kill U.S. personnel. Why on earth would we cut them any sanctions relief? Joe Biden's faulty memory isn't an excuse for taking classified materials. That Biden wasn't charged makes clear we have a two tiered system of justice. #Hur #Biden Joe Biden wants TRILLION in new spending over the next decade. That grows our national debt to trillion by In no way is this sustainable. Biden began taking executive action on day one to systematically dismantle border security. He has no interest in fixing the border crisis he created. Biden's budget request would drive our debt-to-GDP ratio to a higher level than WWII. In years, we'd be spending million more on interest to service the debt than our own national security. Joe Biden will apologize for using the term \"illegal\" but not for the thousands of lives and families destroyed due to his open border policies. He can protect Americans by securing the border. Biden's budget request doubles down on the same reckless spending that has created record inflation. In no world can he say he's been \"fiscally responsible.\" CBP has already encountered individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist this FY to date. We don't even know who these nearly gotaways are. Biden's border crisis is a national security threat! Biden says he\u2019s the greatest supporter of Israel? Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem! Speaking of fundamental fairness for all Americans, when is Hunter Biden going to pay all the taxes he owes? Do not listen to Joe Biden and do not go to Moscow to buy prescription meds. This is unhinged. Joe Biden and Democrats encouraged the crime and violence we saw (and still see). We just passed the Laken Riley Act which requires DHS to take criminal illegal aliens into custody. Democrats voted against the bill. That should tell you everything you need to know about how seriously they take the illegal immigration crisis Joe Biden created. TikTok is using kids to lobby against cracking down on Chinese espionage. Biden asking five fake presidents on a Zoom call what he should say is very on brand for this mess of a WH. Every day that Joe Biden refuses to bring back Trump's Remain in Mexico, more American lives are put at risk. The Laken Riley Act by ensures we lock up criminal illegal aliens. Not a single Democrat even voted to consider the bill. Biden STILL hasn't acknowledged Riley's death at the hands of a criminal alien who was only here thanks to his open border policies. We already know these folks are out of touch, but you have to understand that they truly despise anyone who threatens their grip on power. Early in the morning of March the defenders of the Alamo began their final stand. Today, we honor the nearly brave Texans who made the ultimate sacrifice so that the Lone Star Republic could be free. We will always Remember the Alamo! What changed for Democrats? China's undergoing the largest military buildup in years. Deterrence is the key to security in the Indo-Pacific and America must lead the way. Peace through strength! Zero transparency from an administration that has worked to undermine border security from day one. An overwhelming majority of Americans support voter ID to help secure our elections. Joe Biden has the authority to end this chaos, today. Galanis' testimony corroborates the evidence that we have already found. Hunter was selling the Biden brand. Good to see. It was always an absurd idea to try and kick the leading presidential candidate off of the ballot. Hunter's Spaghetti SpinHunter Biden: \"My dad did not come to dinner\" \"He came and sat down at the I believe that he probably had a Coca-Cola and a bowl of spaghetti.\" This was at the infamous Cafe Milano dinner in where Hunter's Ukrainian,\u2026 Read this and see for yourself! (It\u2019s way better than having to spend in a room with Hunter Biden) And do they have a term for the taxpayers fleeing these Democrat-run cities in droves?", "Weekly Washington Wrap-Up!

Just wrapped up a great meeting with the Fort Madison Mayor, Lee County Supervisors, and dedicated county staff. We went over exciting new community initiatives including the Fort Madison community project and the Lee County EMS community project.

Stopped by the City of DeWitt to sit with Mayor Hasenmiller to discuss the challenges small communities face in Iowa when it comes to development and growth. Check out this week\u2019s \u201cWeekly Wrap-Up\u201d to hear more about some myths you\u2019re certainly hearing out of Washington. Remember ACORN? Great seeing the Livestock Marketing Association in Washington today. We discussed the need for a Farm Bill and how important animal disease traceability is. I promised that I would seek to hold the Biden administration accountable for the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan and I have never forgotten. Nobody will be stopping and the Hawks! Best of luck in the ! It is always a pleasure to host the in Washington.

As the conversations continue on Capitol Hill around the importance of funding medical research continue, I was glad to have the opportunity to meet with the . In hearing, Gen Milley just now remarked that the Taliban didn\u2019t meet conditions for withdrawal.

It was a pleasure to host Dr. Emma Hornick from \u2019s Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology to discuss the importance of continued NIH funding for biomedical research. It\u2019s always a great day when \u201cHawks\u201d are on the Hill! I applaud the common sense decision from the Supreme Court re: Texas' abilities to enforce their own immigration laws. President Biden has had the ability to fix this disaster and has chose to ignore the problem. As we close out National Ag Day, I had the pleasure of hosting today to discuss precision ag innovation and increasing access to connectivity in rural areas. Happy National Agriculture Day! In Iowa, agriculture isn\u2019t just an industry; it\u2019s a way of life. I will continue fighting to ensure our farmers have the resources they need to continue to feed and fuel our nation. 's orders on April to execute a full military withdrawal of Afghanistan did not include an order to evacuate U.S. citizens, the U.S. embassy, or our Afghan partners, despite having such plans designed under President Trump per Gen. McKenzie's testimony. The order to commence the Noncombatant Evacuation Operation to evacuate these individuals was not ordered until August This was a policy failure of the Biden Administration, not a failure of the U.S. military. Today I met with the Iowa Podiatric Medical Society. We discussed physician payment reform under Medicare and support for the HELLPP Act. Thank you all for coming to DC! Visited with CemenTech in Indianola today and not only do they manufacture a great product with practical applications, they started an educational workforce program as well.

Spoke with Mayor Connie Boyer, former Mayor Ed Malloy, Stuart about bio char and Melanie re: CPF grants. Great way to cap off district tour. Please keep touting \u201csuccess\u201d of Bidenomics: Grocery prices are up Eating out is up Baby food is up Rent is up Electricity is up Natural gas is up We pay more for less! Pres Biden\u2019s overspending & policies ignited inflation. Thank you Rep ! Saving the taxpayers money through proper oversight and fraud detection. Winfield Mayor Benford, Angie & JR showed me how the CPF grant we secured for Winfield would upgrade the Wastewater Treatment Facility bringing into EPA compliance.

Children with complex medical conditions or rare diseases face battles every day. During such fragile times, they should be focusing on recovery and living with their complex condition, not coordinating logistics with their care teams. We cannot continue to ignore the aggressive overreach of the Biden administration and the mounting border crisis. Watch my full remarks here Yesterday, the University of Iowa women\u2019s basketball team won their third consecutive Big Ten tournament title! and GO HAWKS!

This week, I spoke at the Alexion Rare Disease Week event. I mentioned the Accelerating Kids\u2019 Access to Care Act, which aims to improve access to life-saving care for children with complex medical conditions. Farmers are the best stewards of the environment. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to attend the emPower Rural America Breakfast.

An extra serving of common sense here in Congress is just what this doctor is ordering! We certainly have the best delegation in all of Congress! PBMs have excessive influence over the prices patients pay at the pharmacy counter. Yesterday, I met with Michael Wright from American Pharmacies to discuss PBM reform and protecting patient\u2019s rights. Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, has experienced some of the most heinous acts in recent history, and individuals are still being brutalized and held hostage by Hamas terrorists. This week, I met with families of Americans held hostage in Gaza and promised to keep\u2026", "CLOSE THE BORDER. I voted against reauthorizing #FISA without a warrant requirement. The Fourth Amendment is not a suggestion. If the government wants to spy on American citizens, they should have to get a warrant. Follow the Constitution. Get a warrant. #FISA It\u2019s simple. Are you with Joe Biden and his weaponized government, or are you with the American people? Get a warrant. #FISA I am proud to join in this effort to protect victims of child sexual abuse material by strengthening reporting requirements. We have no greater responsibility than protecting our children. We must help our hardworking shrimpers on Alabama's Gulf Coast. I am proud to join on legislation to stop federal funds from being used by international institutions to finance shrimp operations in foreign countries. Make sure you and your family have a way to get weather alerts this afternoon! #alwx They spied on President Trump. They'll spy on you. Get a warrant. #FISA I'm with ! Let's uphold our Amendment and END warrantless spying on Americans. Thank you for coming by! #ENDALZ The FBI conducted million warrantless searches of Americans' private communications in Do you want them to be able to continue to spy on you? If not, it's simple. Make them get a warrant. #FISA \"God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble\" Psalms Today we recognize the strength and sacrifice of our Gold Star spouses. I hope you\u2019ll join me in praying for them and their families. More than illegals enter our country every day and the Biden Administration has no idea where they are. If you\u2019re a pro-life activist, Biden\u2019s DOJ definitely knows where you are. Much of Alabama has an enhanced risk of severe weather today. Stay weather aware and make sure you and your family have a way to get alerts! \"Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die.\" John He is Risen indeed. My family and I hope you have a wonderful Easter! \"He is not here: for He is risen, as He said.\" -Matthew KJV This is a direct and intentional assault on Christianity in America. No matter what Joe Biden wants to call it, tomorrow is a celebration of Jesus Christ and his resurrection. Skyrocketing inflation. Wide open borders. Rampant crime. This is Joe Biden's America. It is finished. Wishing everyone a blessed Good Friday! \"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\" -John KJV Thanks to #Bidenomics, Americans are paying more for all goods and services. At the same time, Democrats are using taxpayer dollars to give free stuff to illegal immigrants. I am heartbroken for this young girl and her family. I hope you\u2019ll join me in praying for them. Thanks to Biden\u2019s policies, every town is a border town, including mine. Biden undid every single one of President Trump\u2019s border security initiatives with the stroke of a pen, and he could bring them back today and protect American families if he wanted to. Biden also could have helped pass the strongest border bill in history. Instead, he has chosen to do nothing as eight million illegals, including with a criminal record, pour across our southern border. The blood and the broken hearts of these tragedies are on Biden\u2019s hands. Illegal immigration cost Alabama taxpayers MILLION in These costs will continue to rise as Biden allows illegal immigrants to pour across our southern border. There are new tragedies just like this one every day. The House passed the strongest border bill in history, a year ago. Schumer and Biden could pass and sign it today to protect American families, but they choose not to. May this young woman rest in peace. The American people deserve answers. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, \u201cHosanna!\u201d \u201cBlessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!\u201d \u201cBlessed is the king of Israel!\u201d John House Republicans voted to END Biden's ban on liquid natural gas exports. This single action would add billion to our economy and create over jobs. Today, I voted NO on a TRILLION swamp omnibus that funds the same woke, weaponized and wasteful status quo spending. A majority of House Republicans joined me in opposing this legislation. We need to secure our southern border and put America first. This is the real March madness, and it's endangering American families. Biden could bring back Trump's border policies with the stroke of a pen and end this today, but he chooses to put us at risk instead. We are TRILLION in debt. Do you want million of your hard-earned taxpayer dollars to pay for late-term abortions? What about for a clothing program? for LGBTQIA+ senior housing? All of these are funded in the newest swamp spending bill. The swamp\u2019s new spending package released while you were sleeping includes MILLION for a new FBI HQ. We can\u2019t fix weaponized government if we\u2019re funding it. On Friday, the House is expected to vote on a spending bill that will cost American taxpayers more than TRILLION. We still don't have the text of the bill. I will NEVER vote to spend your hard-earned money without knowing where it's going. The monthly mortgage payment on a median-priced home is double what it was when Biden took office. Thanks to #Bidenomics, the dream of home ownership feels out of reach for many. American families deserve better. Texas can protect its borders - a loss for the Biden Administration and massive WIN for the American people. God bless our Supreme Court! We might not actually have cows on the capitol lawn, but producers are the backbone of our nation. On this #NationalAgDay, we recognize our dedicated farmers, ranchers, and foresters in Alabama and across the country. Your tireless efforts sustain our communities. House Republicans will never fix Biden's border crisis if we are actively funding it. No security, no funding. Border security is national security. When is Biden going to secure our border and protect American families? How many more threats and tragedies will it take? \"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014 not by works, so that no one can boast.\" Ephesians Biden is using your taxpayer dollars to fly criminals into your community. He could end this program and secure the border today to protect American families, but he chooses not to. While you pay nearly more at the grocery store thanks to Biden's out-of-control spending, he just released a budget that spends TRILLION more than expected revenue. America last policies fail every time. Today, I voted against legislation that functionally bans TikTok by giving them just days to sell their operations. This infringes on the free speech rights of million Americans by going after one company instead of the problem at hand. We need to protect Americans' data from bulk exports by foreign adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party, but targeting a singular company is not the right way to do it. Congress should restrict data transfers, not companies. The Biden Administration lied about inflation, but American families already know that. They see the truth at the grocery store. Three presidential candidates have dealt with concerns about how they handled classified documents. Only one is being prosecuted, and it's no coincidence Biden's DOJ chose a prosecutor who has been described as \"overzealous\" to handle the case. The White House doesn't want you to see this. Another family is missing a loved one because of Biden's border policies. Travis Wolfe, was killed by an illegal immigrant driving the wrong way the night before his birthday. My prayers are with his family. Americans deserve better. \"Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.\" Hebrews The number of illegal immigrants Biden has let into our country is higher than the population of states. It's nearly TWICE the population of Alabama. Tonight, made Alabama proud and gave the real state of our union. She\u2019s exactly right \u2014 President Biden didn\u2019t just create the border crisis, he invited it. Joe Biden passed executive orders in the first days of his presidency to undo Trump's policies and open our southern border to eight million illegals. He could bring back those policies and protect American families right now, but he chooses not to. If Biden is ready to fix the border, he should have brought his pen! We sent him the strongest border in history, nearly a YEAR ago. There are more than illegal aliens with criminal records who came through our open border and are roaming the streets of this country. When is Biden going to talk about that? We are adding a trillion dollars to our national debt every days thanks to Biden's out-of-control spending. #sotu The state of our union is just like our border under Biden. Weak. #sotu We are trillion in debt and more than eight million illegals have invaded our country during his presidency. The first thing Biden addressed in his speech is Ukraine. As usual, America last. The border was more secure than ever under Trump. It\u2019s more vulnerable than ever under Biden. Until the border is secure, the state of our Union is in danger. We owe it to Laken Riley, her family, and the many other victims of illegal aliens with criminal convictions to end these tragedies. Why won't Biden and the Democrats join us to detain these criminals and protect American families? Today, we are voting on a #SwampOmnibus that sends BILLION of your hard-earned tax dollars to fund special projects, universities, and trust funds while we are trillion in debt. I am a NO. Thank you for coming by, ! State of the Union prep. Get ready, folks. Secure the border. Stop the invasion. Bring back Remain in Mexico! Heather and I headed to the polls this morning before boarding a flight to represent you in Washington, D.C. for House votes. I hope you\u2019ll brave the rain and make your voice heard! Biden knows his border crisis is a massive national security risk. His response? Let it happen anyway. Biden can no longer deny that his policies endanger American families. How many Americans must die before Biden secures our border? See my op-ed in News below: Raul Ortiz, who served as the Chief of U.S. Border Patrol under Biden from August through May says he never had a conversation with Biden or VP Kamala Harris. As Americans face the horrific consequences of Biden's policies, his administration does nothing. MASSIVE win for the American people this morning. I stand with President Trump! \"Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God\u2019s will for you in Christ Jesus.\" Thessalonians More than illegal aliens with criminal convictions are roaming the United States. Yet Biden\u2019s biggest concern is REMOVING the razor wire at the Texas border. Americans deserve better. Today, the House is voting on a continuing resolution that prolongs Biden and Pelosi's out-of-control spending once again. I will oppose this bill, because it kicks the can down the road and includes NO money for Trump's border wall. Biden and his army of bureaucrats are doing everything they can to make the Second Amendment null and void. We must not let them put more American families in danger by taking away our constitutional rights. The election interference continues. Americans are the ones who should decide our president \u2014 not radical judges. I stand with President Trump! criminal illegal aliens are in this country. And those are just the ones we know about. SECURE THE BORDER! Majority Leader Schumer just said he was \"shaken by what he saw\" at the Ukraine border. What about our own border? How many families have to lose loved ones before he and Biden take action? They could make law today and end these tragedies, but they choose not to. \"Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.\" Peter My heart is broken for Laken Riley\u2019s family. Biden\u2019s America last policies continue to have tragic consequences. This week, Biden bragged that he is continuing his student debt giveaway even after the Supreme Court ruled it This illegal debt transfer has already cost each American family Illegal immigrants from over countries have crossed our border -- many from places that harbor hostilities against the United States. They aren't coming here to do us any favors. Unless the Senate passes this invasion will continue to endanger American families. While you pay a inflation tax on all goods and services, Biden and Eric Adams want to give your money to illegal immigrants. As you struggle to stretch your dollar, illegals get a debit card and each. Biden could end this today with the stroke of a pen. He could bring back President Trump's immigration policies that were protecting American families. Instead, he has chosen to put us in danger.", "Today, we filed our reply brief with #SCOTUS in our case against the Biden admin: Idaho v. United States of America We\u2019re asking the Court to end this year admin\u2019s unlawful overreach and to respect the people of Idaho\u2019s decision that protect life. With this overreach, the administration is trying to nullify the pro-life laws of more than states. But the Dobbs ruling was clear. The issue is now left up to the people and their elected And our state has decided: We protect life. My office looks forward to arguing on behalf of Idaho to preserve its right to enact life-affirming laws. Attorney General Labrador Files Reply to SCOTUS in Idaho v. United States Voter ID Law Upheld in Unanimous Idaho Supreme Court Decision Attorney General Labrador Joins Coalition Against Biden Abandoning Immigration Rule Epic decision. Interesting thread . We see similar tone deaf coverage by in Idaho on most topics. This explains why the vast majority of the public has lost trust in the mainstream media. Tuesday, my office filed its opening brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in Idaho v. United States. We are asking SCOTUS to end the Biden unlawful overreach and respect the people of Idaho\u2019s decision to protect life, both for women and their unborn children. The whole point of the SCOTUS ruling in Dobbs was to restore states\u2019 right to protect life. The Biden admin now wants to thwart Idaho\u2019s exercise of self-government on this vital topic. This lawlessness must be stopped. My office is stepping up & asking SCOTUS to end it. The Biden admin is attempting to rewrite federal law. EMTALA\u2019s text explicitly promises PROTECTION for an \u2018unborn child\u2019 in four places. And Idaho\u2019s law doesn\u2019t stop pregnant women in distress from receiving necessary medical care. It expressly provides for it. Labrador Letter - Human I was honored to be invited to \u2066\u2066\u2069\u2019s inauguration this week. Jeff and I have been close friends since the two of us were elected to Congress in Would not have missed it for the world! The US Supreme Court grants Cert and takes abortion case from Circuit finding Idaho likely to prevail on the merits. Court put on hold lower court ruling that blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies. Idaho will continue to fight to protect life. Congratulations to my dear friend and fellow Attorney General and GOP Class of alum, , on a huge victory in Louisiana. Proud of you brother! ##cajuncaucus #GovernorLandry Attorney General Labrador's Full Statement on SBOE Decision \u201cLabrador has wondered how the State Board could hold a \u201cpreliminary\u201d discussion of the Phoenix purchase on May \u2014 \u201cpreliminary\u201d being the key word in the open meetings law \u2014 and yet give its blessing to a million transaction on May \"He has also openly questioned the premise for the closed meetings: to discuss negotiations that put the U of I in competition with other states, even after the University of Arkansas walked away from a possible Phoenix purchase in April.\" \"\u2018The State Board of Education unquestionably relied on the seller\u2019s representation that other state universities were considering purchasing Phoenix.\u2019\" Always Remember - Eagle Field of Honor The US Sup. Ct. agreed the Sacketts -an Idaho family- can build their home without EPA interference. I am proud to have supported them since I was in Congress & was surprised when my predecessor refused to join this fight. I will always stand for the people, not the bureaucrats. I'll never stop defending your Second Amendment rights. Thank you, Don Nelson, for sitting down with me to discuss my first days in office. Important work is being done on a daily basis for the people of Idaho, and I appreciate you taking the time to highlight it. Funny that those pushing ranked choice voting consider themselves the \u201cEmpire.\u201d But then again, I always thought of myself as a member of the Rebel Alliance. Let\u2019s defeat these bad ideas coming from liberal outside groups. I strongly oppose the Lava Ridge Project. My office will do whatever is legally necessary to support the local community members opposing this project. I charted my own path on the WOTUS challenge, despite criticism. And I was right. H prohibits untested & experimental medical treatments from being used on Idaho\u2019s children. Some critics suggest this bill is It is not. should sign it and my office will defend it in the courts. The actions of the Manhattan DA only serve to further erode the trust our citizens have in our nation\u2019s justice system. This is a sad day for our country and for the rule of law. The legislature should advance a bill that will protect amendment rights from ESG regulations imposed by financial institutions. We should never allow gun purchases to impair one\u2019s access to financial services. #idpol Idaho & Texas are the only two states in the country that were able to block the implementation of the Biden imposed WOTUS rule. That's a testament to the work my office is doing for the people of Idaho. This was a victory we can all be proud of. #FoxNews Major Win for Idaho: Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador Scores Early Legal Victory Against Biden Administration WOTUS (Waters of the United States) Regulatory Scheme My attorneys, working alongside Texas, successfully enjoined Biden\u2019s unlawful WOTUS rule & secured a massive win for Idaho, its citizens, & its industries. Joining this lawsuit was the right move\u2014we iced the new rule before it took effect, & Idaho\u2019s interests are protected. Female athletes find themselves in the middle of a culture war they never asked to be in. Women are expected to compete against biological males to placate a small minority of Americans. We can\u2019t allow this to continue, which is why I filed a brief with the Supreme Court. With the rise of social media platforms, youth mental health challenges are at an all-time high. Apps such as TikTok are aiding the rise in depression, anxiety, and creating unattainable standards. We must be able to obtain the necessary documents to fully investigate this. This Idaho Statesman article is comical, but if their hatred of me gets them on the right side of history, so be it\u2026.happy they are finally taking federal overreach seriously. Welcome to the fight! AG Labrador Sues Biden Administration To Reverse WOTUS Rule Idaho law is clear, those who commit the most egregious crimes deserve the ultimate punishment. We followed the law and obtained a new death warrant in the Pizzuto case.#idpol \u201cMask mandates were a bust. Those skeptics who were furiously mocked as cranks and occasionally censored as \u201cmisinformers\u201d for opposing mandates were right. The mainstream experts and pundits who supported mandates were wrong.\u201d#idpol Glad to see my fellow AGs getting into this important fight. My Office is preparing to file on behalf of the State of Idaho. Stay tuned\u2026.#wotus #idpol A leaked FBI memo shows it is wrongfully identifying \u201cradical traditionalist Catholics as potential racially motivated violent extremists.\u201d As Americans, the right to worship freely is our most sacred right. I will fight to protect that, even if it means going up against the FBI. It\u2019s encouraging to see Caldwell school district place a hold on the proposed gender policy. That policy violated state & federal law. School districts should be academically focused & work with parents to turn out the best & brightest Idaho has to offer - not gender ideology. I am suing the Biden administration for attempting to violate our amendment rights. This latest stunt by the ATF would make millions of law abiding gun owners felons if they fail to register a commonly used gun accessory. I will fight to ensure this never happens. Strengthening the ICAC unit is a top priority of my administration, which is why I asked JFAC for additional resources to hire more investigators. I will protect Idaho children and will vigorously punish the criminals who go after them. #idpol I am directing additional resources to the Internet Crimes Against Children Unit (ICAC). From my first week in office, I said we will focus the people\u2019s resources on prosecuting child exploiters and other serious criminals. I am making good on that promise. #idpol The ISBA failed to respond to the questions I asked of them. This is deeply troubling. I have requested a meeting to discuss. It was an honor to speak at the Reagan Library this weekend to the Federalist Society\u2019s Western Chapters Conference. Thank you for the opportunity to speak and interact with so many outstanding people. Outstanding job by ICAC. The children in Idaho are safer because of these men and women, and the dedication they have to their work. Today I sent a letter to the Idaho School Board Association regarding the proposed Caldwell School district policy. Idaho citizens have serious questions about these policies. I'm trying to help them get answers. BLM's proposed changes to the Lava Ridge Project don't go far enough in protecting Idaho's farmers, ranchers, & our water supply. This project poses dire problems for Idaho's way of life. I am suing the Biden administration to ensure they comply with existing federal immigration laws. I will always hold this administration accountable. The Caldwell school board should be protecting all non-violent free speech. Parents have a right to show up and have their voices heard on all issues affecting their children. I look forward to seeing parents being granted access in future meetings. #idpol It was great sitting down with Don Nelson last week. Thank you for the opportunity. I look forward to more interviews moving forward. This proposed policy appears to violate Idaho law. My office is taking a serious look at how we can defend Idaho parents, kids, and our existing laws should the Caldwell school board choose to adopt this policy. #idpol Agreed \u2066\u2069 \u2014great victory for Idaho! Although it doesn\u2019t matter who gets the credit, I have to give a shout-out to Deputy Attorney General Ingrid Batey for her great work defending this law in court! #idpol It's incredible to see so many people supporting the March For Life. I'll never stop defending the rights of the unborn in Idaho. Big Cir win for Idaho! This will keep us moving forward on delisting grizzly bears. This case is long overdue & recognition of the major role that Idaho & its sister states have played in grizzly recovery. We will keep up our efforts in this I joined other states in reminding firms of their duty to shareholders: economic value of an investment. Firms are instead going woke & prioritizing climate change & DEI. This is a violation of federal & state laws. On Friday I sent a letter condemning the FDA for reversing decades of precedent & allowing abortion inducing drugs to be distributed remotely. This brazen federal power grab endangers women\u2019s health & violates federal and state laws. In Idaho we protect women and the unborn. We are grateful the judge agreed with our motion to dismiss the charges against Sara Brady. It validates the unanimous recommendation by all prosecutors assigned to the case, which I took seriously. We agree with the court, dismissal serves the ends of justice. Big win yesterday for the State regarding the public encampment lawsuit. Idaho law still protects everyday citizens and small business owners from the miserable chaos we see on the city streets of San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland! #idpol One staged trip can\u2019t erase Biden\u2019s years of indifference toward the border crisis. Last year, more migrants crossed the border than people who live in Idaho. Fentanyl deaths in Idaho spiked. We demand a secure border and I will do whatever I can to hold this admin accountable. Thank you, Idaho! Let's get to work. It\u2019s an exciting day in Idaho as all constitutional officers will take their oaths of office during the Inauguration Ceremony. Watch it live here at noon: The Idaho Supreme Court ruled the state constitution does not contain a right to abortion. We applaud this decision. This is a great day for our constitution, the rule of law, and the unborn. The abortion lobby\u2019s assault on Idaho law will continue; I am prepared to defend Idaho. AG Labrador moves to drop charges against playground mom #idpol Today I am excited to begin the great role ahead as the Attorney General of Idaho. There is much work to be done. My team and I couldn\u2019t be more honored and ready to serve the people of Idaho. Thank you! I will always stand up for Idaho, our citizens, the Constitution, freedom, and Rule of Law. More than Republicans endorsed me earlier this year with their vote for AG. Since then, thousands of other Republicans, independents, and disaffected Democrats have expressed their support on social media, with digital contact, or in person as I campaign across Idaho. Fmr Idaho Attorney General and Lt. Gov David Leroy endorsed me today. He said: \u201cRa\u00fal has a unique combination of legal, legislative, and congressional experience, which no prior Idaho Attorney General in history has ever brought to the office.\" Read More: Joe Biden today decided to sue the State of Idaho over our duly enacted pro-life law.

Thank you for your endorsement. I will be a stronger, conservative voice as our next Attorney General. Vote in Absentee Voting, Early Voting, or on Election Day, May in the Republican Primary. BREAKING: Our Legislature passed a strong Pro-Life bill. This new law will push Idaho to the forefront in protection of the unborn. Gov. Little must choose to sign this bill by PM TODAY. I urge him to do so. I will be proud to defend this law as our next Attorney General. Thank you for your support Secretary Pompeo. Serving in President Trump\u2019s cabinet, you understood that America first policies make us stronger, not weaker. BREAKING: Secretary Pompeo has endorsed my campaign for Attorney General. Secretary Pompeo projected American strength around the world. Serving in President Trump\u2019s cabinet, Mike understood that America first policies make us stronger, not #idpol Thanks to Ed Bejarana for having me on the Idaho Speaks podcast.

BREAKING: My campaign has raised in just our first two weeks. The people of Idaho are ready for a change. We need an Attorney General who is not there to simply occupy an office for decades. We need an AG who will stand up, fight back, and speak out for Idaho. Today, I announced for Attorney General of Idaho. I will defend Idaho\u2019s sovereignty, protect the individual rights of Idaho\u2019s citizens, fight back against the Biden destructive policies, and ensure conservative legislators have a true partner in the AG\u2019s office.

Visit to learn more Today I met w/ & Planned Parenthood local leaders preparing for the fallout due to denial of services for desperate people. is determined to be there. #RoeVWade I\u2019m welcoming to Portland to talk about the mental health crisis in America for youth & adults. Livestream our roundtable . Let\u2019s take action on mental health. I\u2019ll keep working to make the federal government a stronger partner in this fight. In case people didn\u2019t know that elections have consequences. We will fight this state by state and at the national level. Shameful (draft) decision by those who say they support freedom and liberty #Roe Today, I am reflecting on the horrors of the Holocaust, when over million Jews were systematically killed by the Nazis. We must speak out against bigotry & tribalism in all its ugly forms & never forget this dark chapter, especially as storm clouds of violence grow in Europe. Urging my fellow conferees to include the SAFE Banking Act in the final COMPETES conference report. The federal government\u2019s foolish cannabis prohibitions makes small, often minority-owned, cannabis businesses vulnerable to crime. The solution: when #SAFEBanking becomes law Delighted to host today in Portland. We\u2019re having conversations with people about boosting homeownership, increasing rental housing, & improving housing affordability. Secretary Fudge is a solutions oriented leader & I\u2019m looking forward to hearing great ideas today. Great to see the growth in regenerative organic cannabis products. certified products will make a real difference for consumers who care about health + the environment, and help the farmers and manufacturers who are doing it right. On #EarthDay, & I are celebrating funding we secured for Green New Deal projects, including two in our community: runway & culvert replacement for fish passage in Tryon Creek. These #GND projects create good jobs & combat the climate crisis. It\u2019s past time for the federal government to treat climate change like the crisis that it is. I am urging to declare a national climate emergency. This is a step that the President can take now, on #EarthDay, to meaningfully address the climate crisis & protect our plant. Old-growth & mature forests are our most effective carbon sinks. This year, I urged the Depts. of Ag & Interior to include these forests in their climate resilience efforts. Today, signed an executive order to inventory & advance protections of these forests. I applaud this decision by the Biden-Harris Administration. It is a critical step in combating climate change & will provide important data on where to focus our forest management and fire reduction efforts. #EarthDay Incredible day with at celebrating our infrastructure bill that will rebuild & renew America. Great to finally have a President who is committed to infrastructure, who actually passed and funded a historic investment and has the team to implement it. Onward! I'm spending the way I know best\u2014advocating to end the failed war on drugs. Join me in urging our friends in the Senate to pass the #MOREAct, the #SAFEBankingAct and my Just as Americans pay a tax when they buy a commercial airline ticket, billionaires flying into space to produce nothing of scientific value should do the same. My #SPACETax ensures that space exploration isn\u2019t just a tax-free holiday for the ultra-wealthy. BREAKING: The House just passed my legislation to #ReplenishRRF. A momentous occasion for the nearly restaurants who did not receive the first round of funding. It\u2019s a great day to #ReplenishRRF The House is voting on my legislation to add billion to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to support the restaurants who were shut out of the first round. Let\u2019s finish the job. Tonight the House votes on my Medical Marijuana Research Act to study health benefits of state-legal cannabis products. Absent a framework, research is outsourced to other countries-a missed opportunity for the industry & millions of Americans who consume cannabis products. Today I heard from my friend at the Ways & Means Committee hearing on her efforts to advance worker-centered trade policies that provide economic opportunities at home & globally. Glad to have USTR as a full partner in supporting sustainability & American workers. It\u2019s time for Congress to catch up with the American public. It\u2019s time to end the failed war on drugs. This week\u2019s House vote to legalize cannabis is one step in that direction. #MOREAct I am about to join my friends at the @IndivsibleTeam and to discuss what steps President Biden can take NOW to combat the climate crisis, create an economy that works for all of us, and help the American people. Join us: I am haunted by President Zelensky\u2019s reminder than in Ukraine, our Pearl Harbor, our is happening every day, across multiple cities. These atrocities must end. I became acquainted with Gerry Frank as a college student as he helped us lower the voting age. Throughout my career I appreciated his advice and many contributions to Oregon. Helping Sen. Hatfield make his mark, Gerry earned his reputation as Oregon's Senator. Sad to hear of his passing. An end of an era. I am delighted President Biden rallied our allies to revoke Russia\u2019s Most-Favored Nation status by ending Permanent Normal Trade Relations. Congress must move swiftly to pass and my legislation next week to further isolate Russia from the global economy. I am thrilled that the latest congressional funding package contains my request for million to develop Multnomah County's Behavioral Health Resource Center which will help people struggling with chronic houselessness, mental health, & addiction issues in our city. Please join me tomorrow for this important forum: \"We\u2019re going to have an infrastructure decade.\" Music to my ears. #SOTU This is what a looks like. Regaining the trust of our international allies to counter Putin\u2019s unprovoked aggression in #Ukraine NE Portland will soon be home to the fire power of with the Ballmer Institute for Children's Behavioral Health, an extraordinary effort to advance research & training for children's behavioral health I intend to focus on this issue as chair of the Ways & Means Subcommittee on Trade. Thank you for partnering with me. No matter where you live in our state, Oregonians know that will come to you to listen to your thoughts & opinions. Congratulations Ron, this is quite the accomplishment. Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was unprovoked, unjustifiable, and undermines the most basic norms of international law. Putin and his cronies should not be insulated from the consequences of their actions. We must also continue to provide direct support to the Ukrainian people, who did not bring this conflict onto themselves. Good on . Shame on McDonald's. Great catching up with as we move to strengthen US international trade policy in the House this week This is great news and great selection. Congratulations Let\u2019s celebrate Bud Clark\u2019s commitment to working together to solve our problems which is so desperately needed now. Bud was one of a kind and we mourn his passing but celebrate a life of service, inspiration and accomplishment. It was an honor to have worked with him on the City Council and to have counted him as a partner and more important as a friend. E-commerce giants like Shein make products in China because of minimal health, environmental, and labor protections. Those products come in tax free if under US products shipped to China are taxed if above vs. That's not fair, and I'm trying to fix that. Congrats . You are the right person with the skills we need now in the OR legislature! Looking forward to continuing our partnership in your new role. January is always a tough month for our restaurants, and Omicron is making it even harder for them to stay afloat. Thanks for your support in this fight . We can't give up. #ReplenishRRF I wrote the FOREST Act with because #ClimateJustice MUST include tackling illegal deforestation. Thanks for your support, ! THIS WEEK: Thanks to you can pre-order four FREE at-home tests per household to be delivered directly to your door. Order now so you have them when you need them: Grant High's own knows that an #EconomyForAll means replenishing the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. He sums up the stakes perfectly. Inaction means \"generational scars for restaurant owners, their families, and their states across America (including OR) have voted to give terminally-ill patients the freedom to choose experimental treatments. But the federal government is blocking doctors from being able to facilitate therapies. I'm leading the charge to change that Dr. King was ahead of his time in so many ways\u2014from the fight for racial justice to his support for effective, healthy, and democratic modes of transportation. Thank you for sharing this photo with me, and for your leadership with the Congressional Bike Caucus! If we want to build an #EconomyforAll, we have to save the restaurant industry that million workers & families rely on. of restaurants that did not receive relief from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund are in danger of permanent closure. I'm not giving up #ReplenishRRF In climate-fueled disasters in the U.S. killed hundreds of people and caused billion in damage. We weren't prepared, and we suffered for it. Let's make FEMA proactive (not just reactive) to the climate crisis. My new Act does just that. Congratulations to for being appointed to Council! I look forward to partnering on our shared passion for a revitalized Ave and other regional priorities. A year ago, we came dangerously close to losing our democracy. And after\u2014amid the broken glass, blood, and feces that littered America's Republicans still voted to overturn a fair election. Our Republic is under siege. The Senate needs to join us in protecting it. At a time of year when when we should be coming together, Joe Manchin has betrayed his colleagues and the American people, especially West Virginians. His state benefited tremendously from the New Deal, Great Society, and Robert Byrd\u2019s pork barrel activity. By Manchin's standards, his constituents would\u2019ve been left out in the cold, devastated. Luckily, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Democrats in Congress weren\u2019t so narrow-minded and mean-spirited. Nearly of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, think it\u2019s time for federal cannabis reform. The table is set. Let\u2019s make it happen. It's been a week since Jonah Hill went on the Today Show and advocated for the bill and I wrote, the National Climate Emergency Act, which would help unleash the resources we need to address the climate crisis. This should be a top priority for Thank you ! Agree I know I am. I\u2019m sure I am. Rose City till I die! Still a great season and great effort Timbers.#RCTID BELIEVE #rctid Never doubt the Rose City!!! #RCTID No place else I would rather be. My grandson is even more excited than me! #rctid #MLSCup Digging out my rain gear while humming \u201cLet it rain. Let it pour. Let the Portland Timbers score..\u201d Today is the day! #RCTID #MLSCup If Congress passed my SPACE Tax, those like the handful of people headed to space tomorrow would be paying their fair share to advance technology and protect our climate. An important part of our local economy has been hit hard, and this is a good step from the city to help. Because of outmoded and unrealistic federal policies, people have not been eligible for other support. Passing the #SAFEBanking Act is the next step the fed gov't should take. Portland can't wait to host the MLS Cup this weekend. , I bet you an Oregon made gift basket of craft cider, beer, wine, and chocolate that our will take down @NYCFC. What do you got? #RCTID Thanks to Sarah Brady for having her boyfriend promote the bill I wrote with to finally have the U.S. declare a climate emergency. Yes! Timbers hosting MLS Cup- never stop believing! Onward to victory. #rctid The team from Utah got away with one last night against the Ducks, but I\u2019m sure the Timbers won\u2019t let it happen again. Go Timbers! #RCTID Did I do this right? may not be the tallest member of the Oregon delegation, but he is a legislative giant in the mold of his hero, Wayne Morse. He leaves an astounding legacy in everything that touches transportation and infrastructure: water, transit, highways, rail and as the only certified bike mechanic ever elected to Congress, is a champion of cycling and so much more. He\u2019s carved out an unprecedented record and Oregon and our whole country is better for his service. I am proud to have served with him and wish Peter every success in the next phase of his career. Medical decisions should be made by individuals in consultation with their doctors and anyone else they choose. Not an extremist #SCOTUS Persistence pays off. #PollutersPay Omicron makes it clear that unless we get the world vaccinated, we aren\u2019t getting out of this pandemic. That\u2019s why I have urged the WTO to end the stranglehold pharmaceutical companies have on vaccine patents. Vaccine equity is a vital issue that impacts us all. Corporations that poison our backyards should pay to clean up their toxic legacies. But they\u2019ve gotten a free ride for decades. Not anymore. The Act includes my bill to reinstate the Superfund tax for the oil and gas industry. Time for the Senate to pass it! Independent restaurants can\u2019t be left behind. I won\u2019t stop fighting until Congress funds every eligible applicant. #ReplenishRRF Future members of the Congressional Bike Caucus! This is my incredible team member and Portland dynamo organizer with celebrating this historic vote! We celebrate the most transformative investment America has made in our lifetime! Imagine, lowering the cost of health care, child care and family care all while fighting climate change and creating family-wage jobs. We can make a profound difference for Oregon, while we renew and rebuild America. It\u2019s time for the Senate to meet the challenge and join us in passing the Build Back Better Act. Great moment to finally cast my vote for this transformative legislation. A long road to get here but worth every minute. Will be critical to keep our voices strong to support this legislation through what will likely be a tortured process in the Senate. Making cycling more accessible to consumers is not a \u201cniche\u201d issue. The policies in will help burn calories instead of fossil fuels \u2014 and every step in the fight against climate change counts. #BikeBackBetter Wildfires. Heat waves. Droughts. Deadly winter storms. Climate change is making them worse, and it\u2019s time we get real about protecting our communities. My new report outlines a legislative roadmap of priorities for how to make that happen. Learn more: Every elected official needs to watch speech on House floor today. Our words and actions matter. Just when you think Paul Gosar couldn\u2019t get any worse, he reaches an appalling new low, even for him. I'm voting to censure him today because violence and hate have no place in America \u2014 or the halls of Congress. Today, on Darcelle's bday, we unveiled a new plaque to make it official: Darcelle XV is on the National Register of Historic Places! Advocating for this in Congress and celebrating Darcelle's historic impacts on LGBTQ rights have brought me great joy. As I reflect on my week at I'm thinking a lot about how important our trade agreements are to our fight to protect the planet. As the Chair of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, I see a lot of opportunity ahead. We're going to seize it. has been inspiring, informative, and an incentive to redouble our efforts on climate. This #VeteransDay, and every day, let\u2019s fight to give our veterans what they are asking for: the best medical care possible, including access to cannabis. We have an opportunity to create ag policies in the U.S. and around the world that are better for the climate, better for farmers, and better for our health. Great talk at with Maria, who farms in Kenya, about global partnerships on this topic. I'm here at fighting alongside my friends for climate action and justice. This is the decade of decision, and we can't afford to wait on enacting bold, concrete solutions to protect the health and safety of our communities. Just voted to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which will bring roughly billion to Oregon: to improve transit systems expand broadband get lead pipes out of our schools and more. Disappointed we didn't vote on Will keep pushing. As a member of the Ways & Means Committee, I helped secure historic paid family/medical leave in the Act. But Manchin is threatening it at a time when Democrats must fully embrace wildly popular and effective policies like #PaidLeave. That's unacceptable. Vows and pledges are fine but my FOREST Act (w/ ) will turn this vision into reality. The world needs to keep commodities associated with illegal deforestation out of our supply chains for good. The Supreme Court could destroy the planet. Pass it on. Today's budget framework is not what I want or what I fought for. Nonetheless, it's a game changer for climate, lifting tens of millions of children out of poverty, and investing in working families. Let's get started. I voted to hold Steve Bannon in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the Jan. investigation. We deserve to know everything about how Trump and his cronies were involved in this deadly attack on our democracy, and how close they came to overthrowing our government. When we make our communities greener: Gun violence goes down Mental health goes up It's time for Congress to make these investments. the skill and courage of Chief Joseph and the strength of his people including many women and children stands in sharp contrast to the treachery and betrayal by US Govt years ago this week. led by Chief Joseph, Nez Perce struggled over miles of rugged, impossibly difficult mountainous landscape to within a few miles of safety in Canada. reflecting on the Nez Perce war of the last great armed conflict with native people in American history and one of its most shameful chapters. On we all need to commit ourselves to honoring Indigenous communities' rich histories, healing the wounds inflicted on these communities by white colonizers, and fighting for an equitable future for all Indigenous people. Exciting day in Portland! Had a great time watching the installation of the Blumenauer Bicycle and Pedestrian Bridge with some fellow bridge enthusiasts. My RESTAURANTS Act saved restaurants. Today\u2019s jobs report shows that we must finish the job. #ReplenishRRF ICYMI: When the heat dome hit, I called Oregon farmers to find out how I could help. They told me that extreme heat events didn't qualify for critical FEMA assistance. So we went to work and changed that! Great work, \u2066\u2069! This took longer than it should have, but thanks to you, we're on the right track. Thanks for having me ! We had a great conversation about the state of play of cannabis in Congress, and the urgent need to fight harder for equity and reparative justice in this movement. Illegal deforestation: -Destroys our planet -Poses serious threats to Indigenous communities -Hurts American jobs + businesses -Plays a central role in organized crime + corruption Thanks for your partnership in introducing the FOREST Act to stop it, + The strategy to trading with China is a laudable development in our bilateral relationship. This commitment to partner with our global allies to hold China accountable will lead to more constructive outcomes. A holistic approach that emphasizes enforcement couldn't be more important as we move forward. If you\u2019re taking reproductive freedom for granted, you\u2019re not paying attention. I\u2019m standing in solidarity with people in Oregon and across America who are marching today against the horrific Texas law that puts a bounty on people for making their own medical decisions. The House voted last month to pass the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would stop attacks on reproductive freedom in their tracks. It\u2019s long past time for the Senate to join us in passing it. Thanks to incredible leadership from both and , we're still moving toward passing the entire economic agenda. It's what Americans voted for, support, and deserve, and we will get it done. ALL of us need to listen to the young people in Oregon and around the world who are raising their voices today to demand climate action. They deserve a livable planet, and it's on us to deliver it. #ClimateStrike Today the House will pass the because nobody should have to worry about extremist politicians busting into their doctors appointments and controlling their most personal medical decisions. Can anyone explain to me why an industry that is destroying our planet and threatening our economy deserves special privileges over other businesses?! Enough is enough. Repeal the oil and gas subsidies. Evictions are a policy choice that we make that jeopardizes the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans. We need to pass the Keep Renters Safe Act. Disgusting. We need an immediate investigation, and to build a system that treats people the way we'd want to be treated. China Forbes amazing talent with Thomas at the beginning thomas Lauderdale\u2019s genius on full display: A Portland treasure! Storm brings down the house at edgefield in the rain. no one notices. Ari and Storm with Pink Martini: And now he is back an all time favorite The round of #ChildTaxCredit payments go out today! Almost three quarters of a million children in Oregon benefit from the credit, and we've been fighting on the Ways and Means Committee to extend it -- and hopefully someday to make it permanent. Our children deserve it. Enough with Republicans' phony attacks on the Build Back Better Act. People who think what happened on January was normal tourist behavior are schooled in denial. We can't be schooled in denial when we consider the threat of climate change and our economy's extreme inequities. As the House begins its work on the Build Back Better Act this week, I am fighting to with my End Oil and Gas Tax Subsidies Act! It is past time to end these senseless giveaways once and for all. Spending Labor Day with workers in Portland demanding they be treated fairly! #NabiscoStrike Make no mistake - by allowing a abortion ban to go into effect in Texas, the Supreme Court is chucking aside Roe v. Wade, invalidating nearly years of legal precedent, and putting abortion rights at risk for ALL Americans, not just those in Texas. This law, the most restrictive in the country, is a consequence of stolen Supreme Court seats and what the GOP did to pack the court with conservatives. But if the Supreme Court won't protect abortion rights, it's clear that Congress must act now to codify Roe v. Wade into law. This attack on reproductive rights underscores the stakes at the ballot box, as we can no longer take for granted that Roe v. Wade will protect against extremist laws. Even in a state like Oregon, we must be vigilant to ensure abortion access is guaranteed and not eroded. Like the Keystone XL pipeline, Line must be terminated. It\u2019s an attack on tribal communities and our environment. I\u2019m urging the Biden administration to Historic fires, hurricanes, and droughts. We're in the midst of a climate emergency and it's time for the United States to act like it! Congress must pass my legislation with and mandating the declaration of a national climate The day has finally come. It's a sad, predictable outcome, showing exactly why endless war is not the answer. While this chapter is now over, we must honor our to our veterans, Afghan allies, and all those who have dealt with the trauma of the last twenty years. Because of a late night SCOTUS decision, millions are now at risk of being evicted as the Delta variant surges. Congress must take action. Today, I've joined to urge Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer to advance legislation to extend the eviction moratorium. At the same time, we need state and local governments to speed up the process of sending billions in housing assistance out to the people who need it. Congress approved these funds months ago. Get the money out the door! Getting ready to honor my friend and former colleague by proudly voting for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, giving us the tools to fight racist voter suppression and restore the For voters, and for John, we must get this Every Democrat in Congress campaigned on a promise to Our budget resolution, that makes unprecedented investments in physical and human infrastructure, is how we do it. Enough with the games. Let's do what we were elected to do! A truly historic pick to lead our National Park Service. Congratulations to Oregon tribal leader Chuck Sams! It's been a delight to work w/ , a trailblazer and amazing resource to us all, for years. Liz \u2014 I couldn't be more excited with your new assignment and what a milestone it is to become the first woman to assume this critical position at . Solidarity to members at in Portland. I commend their courage and fully support their demands for a contract that honors their role as essential workers. We are reintroducing today. Named after my dear friend and former colleague, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act will fight racist voter suppression laws and restore critical provisions of the For voters, and for John, we must get this done. Being a friend should not be fatal, but the window to meet our promise of safety to our Afghan allies is shrinking by the hour. There will be time later to unpack exactly what went wrong. Now is the time to save lives. The U.S. must act quickly to evacuate our Afghan allies! Labor Rights are critical to the American Dream, and the movement lost one of its biggest champions in Richard Trumka. It was a pleasure to work with him on USMCA, another victory for working men and women. #solidarity #UnionStrong Besides extending the which should do NOW, state and local governments MUST get federal rent assistance out to the people ASAP! Then, we in Congress need to figure out next steps for when the first batch of money is gone. Two things need to happen today: needs to extend the State and local governments need to get renter relief money - which was approved months ago - into the hands of the people who need it. This is taking too long. I'm in full support of this. #StopEvictions Please take care of yourself and others during the current Heat Advisory. As a reminder, Multnomah County has cooling centers open today and tomorrow.

This is a long overdue step toward meeting our obligations to Pacific Northwest Tribes for disrupting their lives and livelihoods. It's the least we can do. It was great to see my friend @EnesKanter on Capitol Hill and discuss important human rights legislation. Of course, I had to send him home with a bike pin. Mass incarceration is ripping families apart. I joined to introduce the FAMILIES Act, modeled after an Oregon program, to create an alternative to incarceration for parents and caregivers. It's part of how we create a more fair and humane criminal justice system. As we move toward full legalization, I'm advocating for an appropriations amendment to protect legal state, territory and tribal cannabis programs from federal interference. The American people are demanding a change to our outdated cannabis laws. Congress must heed their calls.

How I feel about the federal minimum being stuck at for #RaiseTheWage The House has voted to #RaiseTheWage because we know that the current federal minimum wage isn't just a disgrace to workers\u2014it doesn't make sense financially. Nowhere in this country can someone making support a family without public assistance. We've seen businesses complain about finding workers. Well people want to work where wages are fair. They don\u2019t want to work for in what they feel is a dead-end job. It\u2019s time to pay American workers fairly and raising the federal minimum wage is an important start! I became a leader in the effort to protect Afghan allies after working w/ students at Portland\u2019s years ago. They knew that to be a friend shouldn't be fatal. Today, we passed another bipartisan bill to better protect the people who risked their lives to help our nation. This is why we are fighting to #ReplenishRRF. As I told , why should a family that is taking kids to Legoland pay a ticket tax, and other charges on their airline tickets, while billionaires in space have tax-free tourism? It's time for a Kevin McCarthy has empowered the most reckless and irresponsible members of the GOP. Having two rabid Trump apologists would have made it impossible for Committee to operate. This goes beyond partisanship. It's about protecting our democracy and holding people accountable! Always proud to stand with my Congressional Progressive Caucus colleagues. I just announced my Securing Protections Against Carbon Emissions (SPACE) Tax Act. Space travel isn't a tax-free holiday for the wealthy. We pay taxes on plane tickets. Billionaires flying into space\u2014producing no scientific value\u2014should do the same, and then some! #SPACETax You pay a tax when you fly on an airplane. Billionaires who fly into space to produce nothing of scientific value should do the same (and more)! As the space tourism race continues, I\u2019m working on a new #SPACETax to make this happen. Stay tuned. The expanded #ChildTaxCredit that Democrats secured in the American Rescue Plan will cut child poverty in half. Not a SINGLE Republican voted for it. Never let anyone say that elections don't matter. This is a BIG deal: Starting today, working families will get monthly payments (via direct deposit or mail) up to per child. You can learn more about the expanded #ChildTaxCredit Democrats secured at Encouraged by reports that Senate Dems may allow for a carbon tariff in their budget. As Trade Subcommittee Chair, I look forward to working w/ them to make it a reality. We mustn't allow polluters to be \"free riders.\" You either become part of the solution, or you pay the price! My virtual town hall is about to begin. Tune-in at PM Pacific Time to discuss the infrastructure, climate action, and more: A must-listen podcast episode with @AsteadWesley and . The extreme heat we experienced in Portland was a wake-up call to the coming attractions of the climate crisis and yet another sign that bold climate action is needed now before it's too late. Spent time today on Ave. The U.S. House bill we passed last week\u2014along with commitments from the Biden admin and local partners\u2014make revitalization of this transportation corridor a real possibility. I look forward to working w/ the community to make it a reality.: PBOT Over the past two decades, tens of thousands of Afghan allies have put their own lives, and the lives of their families, on the line to help our country. In return, we promised them safety and a new life in the United States \u2013 because being a friend should not be fatal. I helped create the Special Immigrant Visa program with former Senators John McCain and Ted Kennedy, two leaders who understood our duty to the people who helped America and relied on us to protect them. President Biden\u2019s announcement today is welcome news that we will keep that promise to our allies. It\u2019s critical to the lives of translators, the safety of American troops abroad, and our country\u2019s international standing. As I told , innocent people who've been wrongfully convicted deserve justice. Compensating them for time stolen by the mass incarceration system should be the bare minimum. Beyond our efforts in Congress, this is something Oregon must address as Time to get real America. It\u2019s past time to stop the failed War on Drugs. What\u2019s happening to Sha\u2019Carri Richardson is just one more example of its collateral damage large and small. The government needs to catch up with America and real life. #Olympics If Congresswoman Herrera Beutler wanted to be helpful, she could work within her own district to try and prevent the Proud Boys and other white nationalists who live there from spreading their hate and violence in Oregon and in our U.S. Capitol. No one is more committed to rebuilding and renewing America than my friend . His leadership as House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman will make a huge difference for Oregon and the country. This only underscores the urgent need to advance our For The People agenda. Our democracy is in danger and we need to act now to protect voting rights. Presiding over the House is always an honor, but especially as we pass the largest, most climate and equity-focused transportation bill in U.S. history. It's an unprecedented opportunity to deliver for Oregon and the country and we're ready to get the job We can no longer ignore the climate crisis, but it\u2019s time we start ignoring the climate deniers. It\u2019s unconscionable that we provide billions in tax giveaways to oil and gas companies each year! We're fighting to that are fueling the climate crisis and instead invest in clean energy solutions. The climate crisis isn't a coming attraction. We're experiencing it right now in Oregon as extreme heat puts us all at risk. It\u2019s long overdue that Congress passes my National Climate Emergency Act with and . We must get this done. The extreme heat in Portland is literally melting our critical infrastructure. It\u2019s yet another striking example of why our infrastructure package must center climate action to halt, reverse, mitigate, and prepare for the worst consequences of the climate crisis. It will be degrees in Portland today \u2013 the hottest day on record. This is not normal! But if we don\u2019t act now to address the climate crisis, it will be. We cannot afford for that to happen. #ActOnClimate As Oregon faces record-breaking high temperatures and extraordinarily dangerous fire conditions, please monitor alerts for air quality, extreme heat, and any need to conserve water and electricity. Reminder: Multnomah County cooling centers are now open. No one will be turned away, and anyone who needs transportation should dial Stay safe in the heat and let's look out for others. West Coast bow tie caucus! The reality of climate change and a warming planet is hitting home with full force. Part of our reaction needs to be common sense.

It was powerful to be there when Janis Shinwari \u2014who worked as an Afghan interpreter with our military\u2014 and his family reached safety in America, greeted by the Army captain whose life he saved. Today, we're advocating together for the many other heroes who can't be left behind. I welcome the long overdue withdrawal from Afghanistan, but time is running out to ensure safety for the brave men and women who risked their lives in service to our nation. We must act now to keep our promises and provide a new life in the U.S. for our Afghan friends and allies. Bees and other pollinators weren't immune from Trump's war on science and the climate. In fact, they were a target. I just introduced the Saving America's Pollinators Act with to suspend the use of harmful pesticides that are killing the pollinators we rely on. During join our effort as a citizen co-sponsor and urge Congress to pass this essential piece of legislation that will protect pollinators and keep America's food system thriving! Take action now to #SaveTheBees It's great to have official portraits of and in the Portland Federal Building.

This week\u2019s National Women\u2019s History Month highlight is Rell Sunn, the \u201cQueen of M\u0101kaha\u201d and a legend in the world of surfing. Even after receiving a serious cancer diagnosis, Rell continued to surf and give back to Hawai\u2018i for another years until her passing. In her final years, she spearheaded a counseling program for breast cancer patients in the state. Rell wasn\u2019t just an elite surfer and a pioneer in the sport for women\u2014she was a champion of her community who embodied the spirit of aloha in every aspect of her life. Her legacy will continue to inspire us for generations. I got to meet with students from \u2018Iolani School, Maui High School, and Kaua\u2018i High School today. Our future is bright with these students\u2014they had lots of insightful questions about what we're working on in Congress and issues in Hawai\u2018i. Mahalo for making the trip to DC! The historic funding we secured for Native housing and transportation is going to make a huge difference in Native communities\u2014but we can't fix generations of injustice in one bill. We have a trust responsibility to Native communities, and we're working in the Senate to bring us closer to fulfilling it. Had a productive meeting with President of the Federated States of Micronesia, Wesley Simina We discussed how we can work together on key issues in our vital partnership, like implementing the COFA agreement & ensuring US military vets in Micronesia get the benefits they deserve The US has a unique and important relationship with FSM\u2014it's one of our closest allies. Mahalo to President Simina for making the trip to Washington and working to help us keep our partnership strong. It was great to meet with students from Mililani Mauka and Ka\u2018elepulu Elementary Schools today during their trip to the Capitol. They had good questions about what it's like to be a US Senator and how we work together in Congress to get things done. Mahalo for visiting! The in funding we secured for Native housing is historic. It's a increase that will greatly improve access to affordable homes for Native families\u2014but it's still not enough We're working every day in to deliver Native communities the funding they need . is obstructing the fight against climate change. For years they've quietly propped up Big Oil, even after making a big show of creating a climate task force\u2014which turned out to be a sham. It's textbook greenwashing. They're not fooling anyone. This week\u2019s National Women\u2019s History Month highlight is Jean King, the first woman to be elected Lieutenant Governor in Hawai\u2018i history. She was pivotal in passing the first versions of the Shoreline Protection Act and the State Sunshine Law, statutes now viewed as foundational to improving environmental conservation and increasing governmental transparency. Jean King\u2019s legacy continues to serve as an inspiration for those in public service, and the impact of her work will continue to be felt for generations to come. After her historic election, Jean King used her position to make critical progress on a number of issues in Hawai\u2018i. She left her mark as a fearless trailblazer for women in Hawai\u2018i politics, a compassionate leader, & a champion for affordable housing & environmental policy I hosted a meeting with leaders from the Pacific Islands Forum today. We had productive talks about how the Senate can support their efforts to improve climate resiliency and disaster preparedness in the Pacific\u2014which is always top of mind in Hawai\u2018i. Conversations like these aren't just important for fighting climate change & protecting the safety of island states and nations, but also to continue growing these vital partnerships Our relationships with Pacific Island nations are for making the trip to DC Women make cents for every dollar that men make in our country. The gender pay gap robs women of hundreds of thousands of dollars over their careers, with women of color losing out on even more. On Equal Pay Day and every day, let's fight to secure equal pay for equal work. years ago we secured more than for Native communities in 's American Rescue Plan\u2014the largest investment in Native programs in US history at the time. We're working every day at to give Native people the support they need. AI has lots of potential, including helping us better predict and prepare for extreme weather events. That's why last week I introduced the TAME Extreme Weather Act, which requires federal agencies to use these crucial AI tools. Republican extremism on abortion has left families across the country facing impossible decisions. It's a more than project to take away women's ability to control their own bodies, and it's not going to stop anytime soon. We need to codify Roe into federal law. READ: We secured billion for COFA nations in the new appropriations deal, which includes provisions from our bill that will allow veterans living in COFA nations to receive health care from the VA. Our partnership with COFA nations is crucial. On International Women's Day, we honor the achievements of women and girls across the globe and reflect on the many ways they continue to advance necessary progress in our society. Although we\u2019ve come a long way, we need to keep up the fight for FULL gender equality. My statement on \u2019s State of the Union address. Honored to speak alongside Dr. Manayan, my colleagues and their #SOTU guests about the urgent need to restore reproductive freedom in America. Far-right Republicans are coming after it all. Abortion care, IVF, birth control\u2014you name it. We can't let them succeed. My guest to the #SOTU address will be Dr. Olivia Manayan, OB-GYN chief resident at . With reproductive freedom under attack by the far-right, doctors like Olivia practicing in states are working overtime to provide vital health care services. Met with postal supervisors from Hawai\u2018i yesterday to talk about how we can continue supporting the hardworking postal employees who we rely on every day to deliver our mail. It\u2019s important we do all we can to ensure they have the resources they need to do their jobs and receive the benefits they rightfully deserve after a career of hard work. Hawai\u2018i credit unions are vital to maintaining economic stability in our communities, and they offer important financial services to our residents. Great to meet with to talk about West Maui's recovery progress and other issues facing Hawai\u2018i families. Great news for Indian Country: is sending to Tribes & Alaska Native communities for home electrification projects We fought hard to include this funding in the Inflation Reduction Act. Far too many Tribal homes still lack money will help fix that For more info on how this electrification funding will help provide power for homes in Tribal and Alaska Native communities, click here. NEWS: We're bringing home nearly in earmark funding for projects and non-profits in Hawai\u2018i, with more on the way in the next funding bill. This money will help these organizations grow and support key projects across the state. No health care provider should have to be afraid of going to jail or losing their license for providing abortion care or helping people start a family. I'm doing all I can in Congress to protect reproductive freedom and support our OB-GYNs. Had the pleasure of meeting with physicians from Hawai\u2018i today. While the far-right assaults reproductive freedom across the country, OB-GYNs are on the frontlines providing critical reproductive health care. It was inspiring to hear their stories. NEWS: We protected critical investments for Hawai\u2018i in this year\u2019s appropriations bill. Billions of federal dollars will help fund projects across the state to improve our roads, increase access to food and housing, and strengthen benefits for veterans. Today I had the chance to speak at the Legislative Conference and later sit down with reps. There are few people more heroic than firefighters\u2014we saw that firsthand last August in L\u0101hain\u0101. We're doing all we can in Congress to support them & their needs. Important read\u2014rising PRC influence in the Indo-Pacific is troubling. Pacific Island nations are close friends & critical partners. More PRC control in the region means more corruption & security threats. Our COFA agreement promotes democratic principles. Renewing COFA will recommit the US to our vital partnership with these island nations and help fight the PRC playbook of using financial aid to sow instability in the Indo-Pacific. We've had this agreement for so long because it's a no-brainer. We must renew it ASAP. For too long, it's been unfairly difficult for wheelchair users to travel by plane. It's especially problematic in Hawai\u2018i, where air travel is essential to get around the state. I've been working with my colleagues to tackle this issue, and it's great to see take action. Great news\u2014the first EV charging station in Hawai\u2018i funded by the Infrastructure Law is now open for business Building charging stations makes EVs more accessible to Hawai\u2018i families. We're working hard to secure more federal dollars to help us build toward a clean energy future For more info on the new charging stations, check out this link. National Women's History Month is a time for us to lift up and celebrate the legacies of women who have made our country a better place. Each week, I'll be highlighting a different woman from Hawai\u2018i who had such an impact on our state. First up: Mary Kawena Pukui. As we continue working in the Senate to expand resources for \u02bb\u014clelo Hawai\u02bbi to be taught in schools, we look back on the legacy and example Mary Kawena Pukui left behind. Her passion and determination have inspired generations to continue fighting to not just preserve, but to amplify and celebrate Native Hawaiian culture at every opportunity. Today & I reintro'd the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The right to vote is a cornerstone of our democracy, but the far-right keeps launching attacks to limit people's ability to cast ballots. Passing this law is crucial. Gutting Roe was never going to be enough for Republicans. It was a gateway to an all-out war. Now they\u2019re attacking IVF, denying people the freedom to decide to have a family. Wanting to start a family is not a crime This isn't about protecting life\u2014it's about punishing women", "It's been an incredible yrs working on behalf of the people of North Dakota in the U.S. Senate. Proud of the chance to come to work every day to get so much done for ND. Thank you for allowing me to serve our great state\u2014I'll keep working to keep our communities strong & safe. This should not be happening. We must change bankruptcy laws now. It's unfortunate for families & workers that the federal gov't shut down again - the time in the past yrs. As I've done before, I'll donate my salary from the shutdown. It's the right thing to do when so many are feeling the impacts of this poor move by the administration. I'm donating my salary from the government shutdown to YouthWorks in ND. It's a critical organization doing important work to combat youth homelessness and help stop human trafficking. Just landed back in DC to vote no on the CR. The Senate already passed a bipartisan bill to fund the government. Now the House needs to pass it and the President should sign it. I have already supported billion once for border security and Republicans couldn't get it across the finish line. For two years, I've been asking for the plan for border security at the Southern Border. Crickets. No corporate board room would give a CEO money for a project without a plan. Some good news: Congress passed my bill to support Native American students so they can get a good education and my bill to help combat human trafficking by making sure health professionals are trained to identify trafficking and report it. Both will soon be signed into law. And the #FarmBill - which looks very similar to the bipartisan Senate bill I helped write, negotiate, and pass - was just signed into law. This is what working and getting results up until the very end looks like. Ask your member of Congress to tell to stop blocking #SavannasAct & to stand up for Native women who are murdered at the nat'l avg. We must stop these horrible crimes & we are so close to passing my bill in Congress. More from : Former ND Senator Kent Conrad has been an invaluable political mentor, confidant, & friend\u2014and I\u2019m honored to have him join me on this episode of #TheHotdish to talk about the importance of public service & the need for bipartisanship Listen here: In a new episode of my podcast #TheHotdish, the tables were turned & former ND Senator Kent Conrad interviewed me about my time serving the people of North Dakota, my legislative accomplishments and legacy, and the future of bipartisanship.

Listen & learn more here: Why we need #SavannasAct: On some reservations, Native American women are murdered at a rate times the national average.

Listen here: Thought the Republican tax bill was supposed to pay for itself. Guess not. . is blocking my bill, #SavannasAct, from moving forward. Call his office at to urge him to support this important legislation that would help address the epidemic of missing & murdered Native American women across our country. #MMIW If my bill, #SavannasAct, doesn\u2019t pass in the next few days, it would have to be reintroduced in the next Congress, & the process would start from square one. We are so close to passing #SavannasAct to help address the crisis of missing & murdered Native American women, and getting it signed into law. Let\u2019s get it across the finish line & help make sure these women are #NotInvisible. Thank you for being such a good friend, before I came to the U.S. Senate & during my time here working hard on behalf of folks across rural America. Thank you for the kind words. It was a privilege to work alongside strong & effective women in the U.S. Senate like my friend & colleague . This should not be happening. The House must pass #SavannasAct now to help stop the crisis of missing & murdered Native American women. The Senate passed my bill. Now let's get it across the finish line to help make sure these women are #NotInvisible. I gave my final speech on the U.S. Senate floor to highlight how I\u2019ve been working hard on behalf of North Dakota & rural America, the work that still needs to happen on many issues & the importance of bipartisanship. Watch here: I often shared the Native American principle called generations with folks in my office, which urges decision making in a way that looks at how this generation\u2019s decisions will affect the next generations, which helps guide our work toward a much broader purpose. When you take the time to rise above partisanship & rancor, I have found so much common ground with so many of my fellow members of the U.S. Senate. I am incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish, like my first bill to stand up for Native American children. Against all odds, with a prediction of only I joined the U.S. Senate. Growing up, my family struggled to get by & it\u2019s a great American story that somebody from my background could actually become a U.S. senator. In I was diagnosed with stage breast cancer. My oncologists told me I had a chance of living more than years. I knew right away that I had a chance to use what time God gave me for good & noble purposes. I chose to come to the U.S. Senate. Thanks @senrobportman for the thoughtful gift! I'll be saving your popcorn to eat in #NorthDakota, a state that shares #Ohio\u2019s appreciation of corn grown with pride & care. Today I helped pass the final strong, bipartisan #FarmBill in the U.S. Senate which includes many provisions I fought for to support #NorthDakota agriculture. Now, it\u2019s critical that the US House votes to push this bill across the finish line before the close of this Congress. Since we passed the last #FarmBill in I\u2019ve been working hard on to make sure it addresses the needs of North Dakota farmers & ranchers. Read more on about my meetings this year to make sure their voices are heard. Had a great conversation w/ \u2019s about how proud I\u2019ve been to fight for North Dakota and rural America in the U.S. Senate.

This story highlights the urgent work still to do to stop domestic violence. Congress must pass a long-term reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to give victims of abuse resources they need to seek justice & recover from trauma Tomorrow at CT, watch live on Facebook as I deliver my final speech on the U.S. Senate floor to share how proud I am to have gotten so much done for #NorthDakota over the last yrs & how I\u2019ll keep working to keep ND communities strong & safe.

Incredibly proud of this major step fwd. #MMIW #MMIWG", "Again and again, hardworking Americans have asked for student loan forgiveness\u2014and President Biden keeps delivering. House Republicans' would slash: \u2014Medicare \u2014Social Security \u2014Affordable Care Act Democrats won't allow it. President Biden's budget would strengthen these vital lifelines our working families rely on. Despite Trump trying to distance himself from the abortion bans he so proudly enabled, Arizona Republicans still blocked an effort to repeal the state's near-total abortion ban that is only enforceable because of Trump in the first place. Don't let him forget it. With gun violence being the killer of children in America, we should be doing everything we can to end this crisis. This new rule would help us: \u2014 Close the gun show loophole \u2014 Expand background checks \u2014 Save lives Now, it's time for Republicans to help us do more, too. Japan is one of our most strategic allies and strongest friends in the Indo-Pacific. I appreciated the chance to hear Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's address to Congress and will keep working to promote democracy, security and economic cooperation throughout the region. NEWS: and I introduced bipartisan legislation that would help ensure Amtrak stations across our country finally live up to the accessibility standards enshrined in the ADA. It\u2019s overdue. You can't believe anything Donald Trump says. He is STILL bragging about overturning Roe and is literally the reason why a national ban is even possible. NEWS: just announced its first-ever legally enforceable limit on PFAS in our drinking water. This new rule\u2014along with federal funding that comes from my DWWIA law\u2014will help clean up communities and protect our children and public health. Clean water is a right. As innocent civilians are still suffering in Gaza and Muslims are facing a spike in discrimination here at home, we have a responsibility to uproot hate wherever we may see it. Wishing a safe, meaningful Eid al-Fitr to all families who are celebrating. Eid Mubarak! The video released today and the violence captured in it is shocking and disheartening. My thoughts are with the friends, family and loved ones of Dexter Reed as they continue to mourn his tragic death. As the investigation into this horrible incident continues, we must allow it to play out fairly and responsibly. We must also refocus our efforts to bolster investments in comprehensive crime prevention initiatives, enhance efforts to keep illegal firearms off the streets and strengthen accountability over CPD, which must continue the hard work of rebuilding trust through transparency. Make no mistake: Trump is to blame for this near-total abortion ban in Arizona, too. He keeps bragging that he killed Roe v. Wade\u2014and now, thanks to him, the Arizona Supreme Court was able to drag that state back to the *Civil War era.* Congress must restore Roe. Now. Monday news recap: President Biden unveils new plan to cancel student loan debt for millions. Donald Trump reminds us that he\u2019s proud to have killed Roe. President Biden is working to move our nation forward. Trump is proud he set us back decades. Today, President Biden will unveil a new plan to cancel student loan debt that would deliver relief to over million Americans. Higher education should be a ticket to the middle class\u2014not a barrier to opportunity. The recent Alaska Airlines incident isn't the first time Boeing has failed to disclose a flight deck feature to MAX pilots. This has become a dangerous pattern and it has to stop. The FAA must act. I\u2019m terribly saddened to learn of Karen\u2019s passing today. Clerk Yarbrough was a trailblazer, a dedicated public servant and moreover, a dear friend. Sending my heartfelt condolences to her friends, family and loved ones today, may she rest in peace. Not a single House Republican voted for the Inflation Reduction Act that capped insulin costs at And now, with their new budget, they want to repeal it outright and force seniors to pay the up to they used to. This is a new level of cruel for Republicans. Republicans' bogus argument that my bill would interfere with safety regulations around IVF is a false attempt to distract people from what it would actually do: Protect IVF nationwide. years ago, we lost a guiding light in the movement for racial justice and equity. It's on each of us to uphold Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s legacy and ensure his dream becomes a reality for all Americans. Our nation's persistent wage gap prevents women from receiving the equal pay they've earned for their work. And AANHPI women are even further behind their white counterparts. This AANHPI Women's Equal Pay Day, it's past time we ensure equal pay for equal work. These heroes represent the best of us. While so many run away from danger, they ran toward it so they could help starving, innocent civilians in Gaza. This was unacceptable, and the Netanyahu administration must do MUCH more to protect aid workers and allow aid in. Sending my best to Clerk Yarbrough and her family right now. Keeping her in my thoughts and hoping she feels better soon. So many of our friends, neighbors and loved ones have autism or know someone who does. And they deserve equal opportunities, too. This World Autism Awareness Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to working toward a more inclusive, more accessible world for us all. During the Month of the Military Child, let\u2019s each take a moment to honor the kids who didn\u2019t ask for their parents to serve, but still sacrifice so much as their moms and dads defend our great nation. This we reject senseless hate and celebrate all of the transgender and non-binary Americans who enrich our nation. Everyone deserves to be who they are without fear\u2014today and every day. Happy Easter! To all who celebrate, may this day of renewal be filled with family, love and hope. Let\u2019s go Illini!! Last week, House Republicans released a budget that supports: \u2014A nationwide abortion ban with no exceptions \u2014Banning mifepristone \u2014Putting IVF on the chopping block And gutting funding for contraception. In Republicans' vision for America, women are second-class citizens. Devastating. My thoughts are with this deputy sheriff\u2019s family, loved ones and the DeKalb County Sheriff\u2019s office. Today we recognize and honor the service of all of the brave Americans who served in the Vietnam War. Your countless sacrifices to defend our nation will never go unnoticed. Alabama Republicans' state law is deeply flawed: it affirms the extremist view that discarding embryos is the same as merely provides immunity for doctors who provide it. That is not reproductive justice. If Republicans actually cared about helping hopeful parents start the families of their dreams, they'd help pass my bill to protect IVF nationwide. It's that simple. Horrified to learn of this senseless attack that left Illinoisans dead today. My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those we lost, the survivors and the entire Rockford community tonight. Please follow local law enforcement guidance and stay safe. It's Republicans that walked away from the most significant border deal in a generation with reforms you specifically asked for\u2014 Because Donald Trump told you to. But sure, keep tweeting like you care about the border. If you don't support abortion, don't get one. House Republicans\u2019 new budget demonstrates their values: they want to gut Medicare, Social Security and the Affordable Care Act. Democrats won\u2019t let it happen. Women should be in charge of their own healthcare decisions. Not judges. Thinking of all those impacted by the tragic collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge early this morning. I'm grateful to our Coast Guard and first responders for their swift response and will continue to monitor this situation closely. Today, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments that could determine the fate of mifepristone in America. The same Supreme Court that already threw out Roe v. Wade. As many worry what might come next, it\u2019s clear: Congress must protect reproductive freedom for all. In Sweden, hundreds of citizens and government leaders meet every Monday in support of Ukraine's fight for their lives against Russia. They call it a \"Monday Movement.\" Proud to join them and reiterate U.S. support for Ukraine This is not the first leadership shakeup we\u2019ve seen at , yet problems still persist and Boeing\u2019s safety culture continues to falter. While I\u2019m grateful Mr. Calhoun listened to my concerns, withdrew its safety waiver request and has committed fixing the safety defect aboard all MAX aircraft, I remain deeply concerned about Boeing\u2019s dangerous and ongoing pattern of keeping MAX pilots in the dark. It's a pattern that must be broken. As a pilot and as the Aviation Safety Subcommittee Chair, I will continue to closely monitor both Boeing\u2019s reforms as well as FAA\u2019s oversight to ensure the flying public is kept safe. Passenger and crew safety must come before profit. Happy Holi! Wishing everyone who celebrates around the world a joyous and safe festival of color. Since lives were so tragically ended in Parkland, gun violence has become the killer of kids in America. Thoughts and prayers won't solve this crisis. Republicans must help us protect our kids and save lives. #RepostYourRage When the Affordable Care Act became law years ago, millions of Americans gained quality, affordable healthcare coverage. Under President Biden, Democrats have worked hard to strengthen and expand it. Republicans want to repeal the ACA. Here's some of what they'd undo Under Democrats\u2019 leadership, a record-breaking million have signed up for healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act. More Americans than ever before have access to the healthcare they deserve. If Republicans repeal the ACA, this healthcare for millions is gone. And most people who shop for coverage at can find a plan for a month or less. That\u2019s a gamechanger for those most in need. Republicans who work to repeal the ACA are also working to eliminate these savings for working families. BREAKING: The Senate just passed a strong bipartisan package that fully funds the government for the remainder of the fiscal year without deep draconian cuts and extreme poison pills, invests in working families and helps move our country forward\u2014not backwards. Wadee Alfayoumi was a precious, innocent This resolution honors Wadee\u2019s life and legacy. It\u2019s also a reminder that we must be united in our shared goal of ending the needless suffering of innocent human beings. Some Republicans say they support IVF but block my bill to protect IVF nationwide... And then there's some that just go right ahead and say the quiet part out loud Again and again, hardworking Americans ask us to address our student debt crisis. President Biden is once again delivering\u2014this time providing relief to public service workers. Republicans can keep trying to block these efforts, but Democrats won't back down. Spring blew in quite the crowd at Constituent Coffee today! Thank you to everyone who joined us. Not a single one of these \"IVF-loving\" Republicans have come forward to cosponsor my bill to protect IVF nationwide. It's been years since MLK Jr., John Lewis and countless other heroes marched from Selma to Montgomery to secure the right to vote for all Americans. We cannot allow Republicans to undo all that they worked, advocated and bled for. We must pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Let me set the record straight: my bill DOES NOT allow wild-eyed hypotheticals like the creation of \"designer\" babies and \"human-animal chimeras.\" It would simply protect IVF for those who rely on it. I can't believe I have to say this. It's been years since the start of the Iraq War\u2014a war that changed countless lives, my own included. Last year, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to repeal the decades-old and AUMFs and formally end the Iraq War. Now, it's time for the House to do the same. Next time a Republican says they \"support IVF,\" ask them if they also believe in embryonic personhood. Newsflash: You cannot do both. NEWS: After I pushed for this, I'm grateful unveiled this wide-ranging report on our infant formula industry so we can better understand the best path forward to strengthen supply chains, support families and prevent formula shortages from ever happening again. For too long, women have been historically and categorically left out of medical research. After working for years to expand women\u2019s health research, I\u2019m grateful President Biden signed an executive order to do just that while helping improve lives. It\u2019s Election Day, Illinois! Make your voice heard today. There's too much at stake to sit this out. It\u2019s not too late to find your polling place and vote. Visit to learn how. Alabama was only the beginning. With Republicans continuing to push so-called \"embryonic personhood\" bills around the country, we must pass my legislation to ensure access to IVF is protected nationwide. Wishing everyone who celebrates a happy, festive and lucky St. Patrick\u2019s Day! Reminder: Illinois\u2019s Primary Election is Tuesday! Voting is your right\u2014make sure your voice is heard. If you haven\u2019t yet, there\u2019s still time to: Vote early Vote by mail or Find your polling place to vote in-person Visit today. For the safety of the flying public, I'm relieved that Boeing committed to fixing the known safety defect on its MAX before trying to certify and put yet another flawed aircraft into commercial service. When it comes to passenger safety, this fix cannot come soon enough. Three years ago, eight six Asian American women\u2014were senselessly killed in the Atlanta spa shootings. Every American deserves to feel safe and live their lives free of fear of gun violence, and no one deserves to be targeting just because of their race. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, I\u2019m proud I had the recent opportunity to visit the Netherlands and Sweden last month. Illinois is a world energy leader. In every meeting, I highlighted to our partners why Illinois is the perfect place for international businesses looking to expand in the United States\u2014which would bring more jobs and economic growth to our state. If we want to cut our global emissions, it is critical that we find partners with shared energy goals to learn from each other and lead by example. And this trip made progress toward doing just that. With growing air travel demands, President Biden's budget would help hire and train at least air traffic controllers to help us build a safer, more efficient aviation system for all frequent flyers. REMINDER: The last president tried to slash Social Security and Medicare every single year he was in office. President Biden's budget would protect and strengthen these lifelines that working families depend on. If someone needs IVF to start or grow the family of their dreams, they should be able to access IVF without fear of being criminalized. I\u2019ve long pushed to take stronger actions on EtO and I\u2019m proud this new rule will help us: Reduce these toxic, cancer-causing emissions Advance environmental justice Improve health outcomes Every American deserves to breathe safe air. Wadee Alfayoumi\u2014the who was murdered in a chilling act of hate against thePalestinian and Muslim communities in Illinois\u2014should still be alive today. I'm proud to help introduce a resolution today honoring his life and send the message: Hate has no place here. VETS: As of this month, all Veterans that were exposed to toxic substances during their service are now able to get the healthcare they need from the VA without applying for VA benefits first. Visit to get enrolled today! It\u2019s past time all of America's transit stations live up to the promises enshrined in the ADA\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what my ASAP Act in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is helping us do. If we passed President Biden\u2019s budget, we\u2019d invest millions to help finish the job. NEWS: Democrats are reconnecting communities that have been historically displaced by transportation projects. Creating new transit routes Improving infrastructure Advancing environmental justice Driving economic growth No community left behind. House Republicans, don't turn your backs on Ukraine. If you are pro-democracy and then it's time to pass the Senate's bipartisan bill to deliver Ukraine aid. Now. Budgets are statements of values, and President Biden\u2019s values are clear: he wants to keep building on our progress to grow our economy, lower costs and invest in working families. Republicans might say they support IVF. They might say they support those who serve. But last night, Senate Republicans blocked and my bill to expand access to IVF for our servicemembers and Veterans. Republicans' actions speak for themselves. Four years ago, Breonna Taylor was fatally shot in her own home by those sworn to protect her. We must #SayHerName, uproot systemic racism and pass commonsense reforms to help end these racially charged tragedies. After pushing to expand IVF coverage, I commend VA and President Biden for taking action to do right by our Veterans seeking to start or grow their families. It\u2019s easy to claim to support IVF, but as this announcement reminds us: Action is what matters to hopeful parents. Happy Birthday, ! Always proud to be a Girl Scout and thankful for the skills, relationships and experiences the organization taught me and countless other girls. years ago, thousands raised their voices while dozens got out of their wheelchairs to crawl up the Capitol's steps to demand from Congress: Pass the Americans with Disabilities Act. A few months later, Congress did. I'm forever grateful for the historic Capitol Crawl. Over the course of their lifetimes, women make hundreds of thousands of dollars less due to pay disparities. Women of color will make even less. The gender wage gap holds women back. It holds our economy back. On Equal Pay Day, it's time to ensure equal pay for equal work. The American Rescue Plan is doing what Democrats' wrote it to do\u2014it helped rescue our economy, kickstarting one of the fastest post-pandemic recoveries in the world while supporting working families and small businesses at the same time. Not a single Republican voted for it. As we continue to see an alarming rise of violence against the Muslim community, it's up to each of us to reject hate in all its forms and lead with compassion toward all. Wishing a peaceful start of Ramadan to all those who celebrate across the nation. Ramadan Kareem! Legislators keeping the lights on is the least Americans deserve. This deal includes so many critical priorities I pushed for including: Fully funding WICNearly billion for aviation safetyIncreased public safety for the DNC in Chicago When women are empowered with better opportunities, not only does it open up a world of possibilities for them\u2014but it also makes the whole world better, too. It was an honor to host Dr. Amanda Adeleye\u2014a healthcare provider for countless hopeful parents in Illinois who rely on IVF\u2014as my State of the Union guest. This International Women's Day, Dr. Adeleye and I agree: it's as important as ever that we protect IVF for all. Talk is cheap. If truly wants to protect IVF, she'll help me pass my Access to Family Building Act\u2014which simply provides patients with a federal right to receive IVF, and doctors a federal right to provide IVF if they want to nationwide. Tonight, President Biden underscored the historic progress Democrats have made for working families with one of the fastest and strongest post-pandemic economic recoveries in the world. As he reminded the nation of Republican\u2019s hypocrisy on everything from border security to reproductive rights, President Biden also reminded us that the American people can achieve anything when we are united toward common goals rather than divided by fear and anger. While we\u2019ve made great progress, I look forward to continuing our work to help make the President\u2019s vision for the future of our nation a reality: A future that improves lives, guarantees the right to IVF nationwide, restores Roe v. Wade and keeps our communities safe. So let me get this straight\u2014 believes life begins at conception, which means she thinks embryos are children... Which means she thinks IVF involves murder... But she just said she supports protecting IVF\u2026 Make it make sense. Today's GOP, ladies and gentlemen. They said they wouldn't overturn Roe. They said they wouldn't come for IVF. But they did. It's never been about being pro-life\u2014it's been about controlling women's bodies. We cannot allow the rights of embryos to be prioritized over the rights of women. Full stop. Again and again, hardworking Americans ask us to address our student debt crisis. President Biden is once again delivering\u2014this time providing relief to public service workers. Republicans can keep trying to block these efforts, but Democrats won't back down. It's been years since MLK Jr., John Lewis and countless other heroes marched from Selma to Montgomery to secure the right to vote for all Americans. We cannot allow Republicans to undo all that they worked, advocated and bled for. We must pass the Freedom to Vote Act. It's been years since the start of the Iraq War\u2014a war that changed countless lives, my own included. Last year, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to repeal the decades-old and AUMFs and formally end the Iraq War. Now, it's time for the House to do the same. Next time a Republican says they \"support IVF,\" ask them if they also believe in embryonic personhood. Newsflash: You cannot do both. For too long, women have been historically and categorically left out of medical research. After working for years to expand women\u2019s health research, I\u2019m grateful President Biden signed an executive order to do just that while helping improve lives. It\u2019s Election Day, Illinois! Make your voice heard today. There's too much at stake to sit this out. It\u2019s not too late to find your polling place and vote. Visit to learn how. Alabama was only the beginning. With Republicans continuing to push so-called \"embryonic personhood\" bills around the country, we must pass my legislation to ensure access to IVF is protected nationwide. Reminder: Illinois\u2019s Primary Election is Tuesday! Voting is your right\u2014make sure your voice is heard. If you haven\u2019t yet, there\u2019s still time to: Vote early Vote by mail or Find your polling place to vote in-person Visit today. For the safety of the flying public, I'm relieved that Boeing committed to fixing the known safety defect on its MAX before trying to certify and put yet another flawed aircraft into commercial service.

If we want to cut our global emissions, it is critical that we find partners with shared energy goals to learn from each other and lead by example. And this trip made progress toward doing just that. The Netherlands and Sweden also have a lot to teach the world about recycling, waste management and energy production. It was a pleasure to get a first-hand look at the innovative solutions being developed there that help tackle the climate crisis.

This is more proof our state is worth investing in. It was great to talk with Mayor Rod Bobo about water and wastewater infrastructure, working together to reduce and prevent crime, and the need for a community center in West Point. No jail cell or word limit has been able to stifle Vladimir Kara-Murza\u2019s advocacy. The world has benefited from his words. Last month, from Prison Colony No. in Siberia, he wrote, \u201cSometimes the most powerful tool of all is simply telling the truth.\u201d Every community needs reliable health care, but they all have unique needs. A approach fails to meet the particular issues facing different regions of Mississippi. Read more about this in my weekly report: Vladimir Kara-Murza was detained and put in prison in sentenced to years in jail after speaking out against President Vladimir Putin. I delivered a floor speech calling for the Biden administration to label Kara-Murza \u201cunlawfully and wrongfully detained.\u201d Strengthening deterrence in the Indo-Pacific requires advancing the U.S.-Japan alliance by upgrading our mutual and respective command and control. More effective U.S.-Japan alliance command and control will further integrate our two militaries. In order to achieve that benefit, the US needs to establish a fully operational Joint Task Force HQ, as mandated by NDAA, along with subordinate Joint Task Forces. I look forward to holding DoD accountable to implement this legislatively mandated requirement. I met with Long Beach Mayor George Bass today to discuss the city\u2019s unmet disaster recovery needs, including those from Hurricane Zeta. I will keep working with local officials to deliver results. The Biden admin's naval policies create more excuses than ships. Since took office, the Chinese Navy has grown their battle fleet while ours has shrunk. Congress will again need to act to prevent early ship retirements & provide sailors with the platforms they need to win. The Biden admin wants to put a on everything: Whether it is health care, nursing homes, or in this case, energy policy. Blaming rural states such as Mississippi for issues in major metropolitan cites in states far away is just silly. During this morning's hearing, I asked Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin questions about Israel and Gaza. His responses: This morning's hearing was the first time Biden administration officials have defended this year\u2019s defense budget request before . Watch my full opening remarks: Mississippi, severe weather is headed our way. Be alert and make a plan now. After Pearl Harbor and no one asked us about a ceasefire. Calling for a ceasefire, instead of hostage release and unconditional victory, creates a false equivalence between Israel & Hamas. My full remarks affirming Israel\u2019s right to defend itself: \"But instead of displaying American resolve, our President seems to be mollifying the left wing of his party,\" Wicker said. \"Calling for a ceasefire instead of hostage release and unconditional victory creates a false equivalence between Israel and Hamas.\" It was my honor to work together with other members of the Mississippi delegation to secure federal support for new projects at two health care centers, which will allow these providers to reach even more of our neighbors. Mississippi\u2019s federal delegation continues to reaffirm our support for Meridian to receive the mission at Key Field.

Veterans: Please make sure you apply for the PACT Act benefits you deserve. Call or visit before the end of September. More heartbreak from gun violence, sadly in our own state again. It's heartbreaking to see the destruction caused by the wildfires in Hawaii. My thoughts are with all Hawaiians, particularly those who lost loved ones and the heroic firefighters battling the fires on Maui. I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Tony Bennett. The world lost a wonderfully talented musician who inspired millions, San Francisco lost a beloved champion and I lost a dear friend.: Jeff Reinking: Liz Hafalia From riding the cable cars to celebrate their renovation to uplifting us by leading a city-wide singing of \u2018I Left My Heart in San Francisco\u2019 during the pandemic, Tony\u2019s love and support for San Francisco have been felt for decades. Tony was above all else a kind and generous person who was loved by so many and whose music transcended generations. His heart will forever be in San Francisco and ours will forever be with him. Those affected by Feb storms only have a few days left to apply for FEMA disaster help Help is available in: Butte, Kern, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Mono, Monterey, Nevada, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, Tulare, Tuolumne Call FEMA to apply:\u2026 Pleased to see that the Navy accepted the USNS Harvey Milk, built in San Diego, into the fleet. It's a fitting tribute to a great American, Navy veteran and my friend Harvey Milk it will continue to sail in service to our country for many years to come. Three of the largest and most destructive wildfires in California's history were started by electrical equipment. I just introduced a bill with to reduce that risk in our federal forests. Great news! The Senate just confirmed Rosie Hidalgo as the director of the Office on Violence Against Women at the Justice Department. I worked closely with her to pass the latest reauthorization of VAWA and know she will be an excellent advocate for domestic violence survivors. Happy Independence Day! Wishing everyone a safe and happy July holiday! The facts are clear: A woman is five times more likely to be murdered if her domestic abuser has access to a gun. If the Supreme Court strikes down this law, more women will be killed. It\u2019s that simple. It\u2019s extremely disappointing that on the last day of Pride month, the Supreme Court has enshrined discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. This is the first time the court has granted businesses the right to deny services to a protected class of people. I\u2019m fearful it has now opened the door for other forms of discrimination by businesses claiming First Amendment protections. The First Amendment protects an individual\u2019s speech. But it\u2019s not a tool to strike down other important constitutional protections, such as the right to be free from discrimination. This decision will harm real people who again can be treated as second-class citizens. This is a deeply disappointing decision by the Supreme Court. It will do long-term damage to our ability to build diverse and robust institutes of higher education. I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Peg Yorkin. Our country lost a feminist icon, but I lost a dear friend. Peg played a significant role in my first election to the Senate. Her foundation was backing women candidates. That support proved instrumental, helping elect four women to the Senate \u2013 including Senator Boxer and myself in California \u2013 in the \"Year of the Woman.\" It breaks my heart to know we\u2019ve lost such a powerful leader who helped secure so-much progress for women around the world. However, I take comfort in knowing that her work will continue in the millions of women she helped empower. I\u2019m deeply concerned about the escalating violence in Israel and the West Bank. Dozens have already been killed, hundreds injured and civilians on all sides will continue to suffer as long as the conflict continues. The only enduring answer to the conflict is a two-state solution. I urge the Israeli and Palestinian leadership to return to the negotiating table, end the violence and forge a path forward to a just and lasting peace for both peoples. Today is #Juneteenth, a day to celebrate the end of slavery in the United States and recommit ourselves to fighting racism and injustice. It\u2019s reprehensible that Republican governors are callously sending migrants, including families with minors, to California just to score cheap political points with their base. Prescribed burns are one of the best tools to prevent massive, catastrophic wildfires. As the EPA works to strengthen air quality standards, we want to ensure that California can still use this important wildfire prevention technique. Happy #Pride, Los Angeles! As the parade closes out this weekend\u2019s festivities, let\u2019s celebrate the progress we\u2019ve made and recommit to the fight for full equality. I\u2019m pleased we were able to raise the debt limit and avoid self-inflicted wounds to our economy by refusing to pay our bills. This was not a perfect bill, but it was the result of compromise and I applaud President Biden for successfully negotiating it. While I would have preferred to increase the debt limit without the conditions set by House Republicans, this was a far better outcome than defaulting on our debts. This brinkmanship with our economy must end. Holding the full faith and credit of the United States\u2019 hostage for partisan gain must not become the new normal. As you celebrate this Memorial Day, take a moment to honor the brave men and women of our armed forces who gave what President Lincoln called \u201cthe last full measure of devotion\u201d in service to our nation. We applaud the proposal agreed to by California, Arizona and Nevada and the federal government to conserve million acre-feet of water over the next three years from the Colorado River. This proposal shows the commitment that California has to saving the Colorado River system. Another weekend in the U.S. was marred by gun violence. A gunman in Chico killed a girl and wounded five other people at a house party. And then the horrific scene at a mall in Texas, where a gunman killed eight people and injured six more using an assault weapon. Sadly, too many have accepted gun violence as a normal part of life. I refuse to join them. Democrats have introduced commonsense bills - like requiring universal background checks and banning dangerous assault weapons - to prevent these tragedies. But it will require courage from lawmakers to stand up to the NRA and pass meaningful gun safety legislation. I hope that more will look at the violence we saw this weekend and realize we don't have to accept this as the new normal. #EnoughIsEnough Glad to hear the police have arrested an individual suspected of multiple stabbing attacks near UC-Davis. I will continue to monitor the situation closely. My thoughts are with the victims and their families. The Senate continues to swiftly confirm highly qualified individuals to the federal judiciary, including seven more judicial nominees who were confirmed this week. There has been no This includes the confirmation of Judge Wesley Hsu to the Central District of California. He will make an outstanding jurist and I\u2019m proud to see him join the federal bench. While the Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced eight strong nominees during my absence, I\u2019m disappointed that Republicans are blocking a few in committee. I\u2019m confident that when I return, we will be able to move the remaining qualified nominees to the Senate floor for a vote. Once again we\u2019ve witnessed another horrific mass shooting in the United States. My heart breaks for the five individuals slain by a gunman in an execution-style killing, including an child. Five people are dead because an angry individual had easy access to an assault weapon. And the news is constantly filled with headlines about similar tragedies. How many more people have to die before we act? I\u2019ve introduced bills to prohibit the sale of military-style assault weapons, ban high-capacity magazines and expand the use of red-flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. Each of these deserves to be debated and voted on. This Fox poll shows widespread public support for multiple bills I\u2019ve introduced to reduce gun violence. of Americans support raising the age to purchase guns to of Americans support expanding red-flag laws. of Americans want to ban assault weapons. Republicans in Congress should look at this Fox poll and recognize that the American people want to see meaningful gun safety legislation enacted into law. These are commonsense steps that will make a real difference in reducing gun violence. Seven of the largest wildfires in California history were in Northern California, and five of those were in the last five years. That\u2019s why and I are calling on the Forest Service to stand up a night firefighting air unit for Northern California. A night flying unit has been in place in Southern California for more than years and has an excellent record of safety and firefighting effectiveness. Establishing a Northern California unit would boost firefighting capabilities in some of our most vulnerable forests. Joshua Tree National Park is one of the most beautiful landscapes in California. It has a diverse ecosystem and is home to endangered species like the Desert tortoise and the park\u2019s namesake \u2013 the Joshua tree. Learn about it and California\u2019s other parks during", "Strengthening our background check system & closing the gun seller loophole will save lives. Great to see the Biden Admin implementing the Bipartisan Safety Communities Act & stemming the flow of illegally acquired firearms. We need to make sure that forever chemicals like PFAS are forever gone. Fantastic to see & taking actionable steps to get forever chemicals out of our drinking water\u2014keeping Americans safe & healthy. Tick borne diseases cruelly debilitate & destroy lives\u2014a menace growing worse as the number & variety of ticks & diseases multiply every year.

This incredibly impressive team has shown grit, determination, & heart throughout the entire season. Coach Hurley is an incredible leader & mentor. It\u2019s been a joy to watch the team\u2019s historic run. #HuskyNation will be cheering on tonight. Can\u2019t wait to see these champs claim back-to-back title victories. Good luck! No excuse for the president\u2019s unfettered Insurrection Act power. My measure would impose sensible limits. #Eclipse watching with bipartisan, inspiring solar sight. Honored to join in celebrating a magnificent heritage & culture at the Polish American Foundation\u2019s annual gala\u2014with gratitude for their steadfast support for Ukraine as it fights Russia\u2019s brutal murderous assault.

Honored to join Lisa, Dennis, & the WTNH team. Added to its national security & privacy threats, dangerous TikTok challenges continue to pose a deadly risk to young people. TikTok\u2019s denials ring hollow. Another reason for different owners, not the Chinese Communist Party. Gathered at Berlin\u2019s Gold Star Memorial\u2014in a chilly wind\u2014spouses & parents still grieving fallen loved ones honored their courage & sacrifice. Among them, Amy Antioho whose leadership helped us pass the PACT Act in memory of her husband Peter, a casualty of toxic burn pits.

The Chief\u2019s Cup in New Haven pits police vs. firefighters in one of the year\u2019s best hockey with dedicated public servants on both sides. Proud to be with you, even if not on the ice. Big Tech, including TikTok, has failed kids by putting profits over safety. Students at Hartford's Sport & Medical Sciences Academy made it clear that the time for stronger online safeguards is now\u2013that's why my Kids Online Safety Act has strong bipartisan support, cosponsors. Too many children lack access to health care health centers remedy that issue by providing physical & mental health services to students. The grant from the federal government for this health center allows us to keep kids healthy & ready to learn. Flooding in Hartford\u2019s North End has devastated hundreds of families & businesses in one of the poorest zip codes in the state. The million in federal funding is a key step towards addressing this issue\u2014a victory for the community that took a stand for environmental justice.

Congratulations to Ting Luo and The Green Teahouse in Farmington for being named the SBA Minority Owned Small Business of the Year. This award is a reflection of tireless hard work, courage, & the American dream. No excuse for silence or inaction with hate crimes spreading. Federal resources are available but still more are needed. This moment is critical for all to stand up, speak out. Saving Deer Lake was a true team effort\u2014 environmental activists, community leaders, and many others, most prominently, David Knapp. Preserving this gem for future generations is a huge win over developers. Tater Baseball was started by the Vargas brothers just a few years ago, & now makes bats for MLB players, as well as Little Leaguers. It\u2019s a great American baseball success story in Cheshire, CT!

Stopping puppy mills & other abusive animal profiteering requires stronger penalties & enforcement by the U.S. Agriculture Dept. My bipartisan Goldie\u2019s Act would help rescue animal victims, & hold abusers accountable. Gang violence\u2014fueled by illegal guns originating in the US\u2014is a humanitarian nightmare plaguing Haiti. We can combat this menace with the Caribbean Arms Trafficking Causes Harm Act. I stand with St. Patrick-St. Anthony Church parishioners in support of the Haitian people. Great morning in Rocky Hill with CT manufacturing leaders & innovators at the Marcum Manufacturing job growth, innovation & a strong economy, integrating AI safely into a new industrial revolution, & building workforce skills to meet global challenges. Shaken by Caroline Koziol\u2019s story\u2014social media upending her life w/ eating disorders driven by black box algorithms. Her demand for accountability & reform supports my Kids Online Safety Act, hopefully heading for Senate passage w/ bipartisan supporters. The Kids Online Safety Act provides tools to protect against toxic content online\u2014allowing people to make choices & maximize benefits, not censor or block content. At Naugatuck High School, I heard how students want freedom from algorithms & accountability from Big Tech. Tyler Belanger\u2019s courageous, visionary leadership at his family\u2019s Shady Oaks Assisted Living Facility has made it the Small Business Administration family-owned business of the year\u2014feels like a real home with world class care. To all celebrating this sacred holiday of faith & renewal, I wish you a joyful & peaceful Easter with loved ones & friends. Protecting student athletes\u2014not just NIL but education & health\u2014is critical. College athletics makes billions for schools & businesses, profiting from their blood, sweat & tears.

Powerfully moving funeral for Joe Lieberman brought tears, laughter & redoubled resolve to friends & family in Stamford. Even as he was mourned, his life was celebrated as exemplifying faith & family, patriotism & public service\u2014 rising above partisan rancor. An incredible demonstration of grit, perseverance, & determination\u2013 congratulations to CT's Ryan Fox for winning the Iditarod Trail foot race through the Alaskan wilderness! Joe Lieberman was my friend for over years. On world & national stages, he helped to define & frame an era of history. He was a fierce advocate, a man of deep conscience & conviction, & a courageous leader who sought to bridge gaps and bring people together. Joe was dedicated to family & faith, & he was a role model of public service. He never ceased listening to both friends & adversaries. He leaves an enduring legacy as a fighter for consumers, environmental values, civil rights, & other great causes of our time. Joe was tireless in working for Connecticut no matter how far or high he went. Cynthia & I are with his family in heart & prayer at this difficult time. I\u2019m in solidarity with Ukrainian American students at UConn who are bravely standing up & speaking out against hate speech\u2014 threats & intimidation aiming to deter their resolute support for Ukraine. Their courage is inspiring, & efforts to silence them are cowardly & condemnable. As more & more young people face nicotine addiction, I call on the FDA to take immediate action to impose regulatory safeguards on nicotine pouches like Zyn & remove these dangerous products from the market while it completes its review. Especially during March Madness, sports betting companies target problem gamblers\u2014 often in the military or among veterans. My GRIT Act will help them defend against predatory practices. Thank you to David Yeager & Amplify for helping veterans with gambling addictions. Honored to gather with CT leaders & advocates to deliver a message to SCOTUS\u2013 mifepristone is safe & effective, & it has been for years. Connecticut will keep fighting to defend reproductive rights and women's health care across the nation. Mifepristone has been safely & effectively used for decades as part of essential reproductive care. Today, radical Republicans are asking SCOTUS to overrule FDA\u2019s scientific judgement & limit access to medication abortion in all states. If they succeed, patients will suffer. Working dogs are warriors & heroes in our military & police forces. That's why I was thrilled to honor Bocci for Veterans Day. Thank you, Bocci & Officer Giansanti, for your hard work keeping us safe! Thrilled to grab bagels at Flanders Donut and Bake Shop in East Lyme this morning \u2013 a mainstay in the southeastern CT community for over years. While he\u2019s here, Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Gallant should have a word with Speaker Johnson \u2014 urging approval of the bipartisan aid package for Ukraine & Israel so vital to those countries & our own national security. Put it on the House floor for a vote. Shifting top Boeing execs is no substitute for changing culture\u2014 focusing on safety, not production speed. To regain respect & trust, Boeing must restore reliability, provide transparency, & fully cooperate with Congress & safety regulators like the FAA. Celebrating St. Patrick\u2019s Day in Mystic\u2014 a heartwarming, joyful parade under bright blue skies & green gear. Thanks to organizers\u2014 & huge crowds braving chilly winds. Red Flag Laws save lives\u2014as hard facts show & I\u2019ve repeatedly said in advocating my bills year after year. They separate people from firearms when a court finds they\u2019re dangerous\u2014to themselves or others. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provided a good step in funding for state laws but states still lack them. Thank you to the Vice President for elevating the impactful, important way Red Flag laws can stop gun violence & carnage. A Resource Center to help start & sustain Red Flag legislative efforts can make a big difference. I\u2019ll continue to push for action in Congress. The hideous ISIS-K attack carries a chilling warning about that terrorist group\u2019s continuing threat\u2014& the imperative for nations uniting against it. If Putin cared more about his own people than illusions of empire & paranoid delusions about America, he\u2019d cooperate in this cause. Our intelligence community warned Russia about the ISIS-K threat because we seek to protect innocent civilians\u2014one of America\u2019s great moral values. Craven tyrants like Putin care little for their civilians, let alone Ukrainians. Putin\u2019s refusal to heed our warning speaks volumes. I'm demanding of TikTok facts\u2014because the American people deserve & need to know the chilling truth about TikTok\u2014it\u2019s a clear & present threat to national security & privacy. It\u2019s a weapon pointed at Americans that all should see clearly. American intelligence & law enforcement officials on a bipartisan basis have repeatedly raised alarms that the Chinese government can use its direct & absolute control over ByteDance to exert malign influence over what users see on TikTok & spy on their private information. As we consider steps to separate TikTok from the Chinese gov\u2019t, the American people must understand the national security issues at stake. I\u2019m urging the of information about DOJ & State AGs\u2019 antitrust case against Apple is a historic fight for digital competition & consumer rights. Apple\u2019s ironclad grip on the iPhone & mobile market clearly raises prices on consumers & undercuts the next generation of tech rivals. Consumers should not be exploited by monopolistic gatekeepers. Congress must also do its part by moving forward with legislation like my Open App Markets Act that would free up the app economy to new competitors & give users more control over their own devices. I\u2019m heartbroken & furious about another anti-Ukrainian incident on UConn\u2019s & potentially inciting violence. I stand with the UConn Ukrainian community & will work with UConn as they investigate these acts of hate. Lots of joy & pride at Danbury Firefighters\u2019 promotion & awards ceremony. The community celebrated their skill, courage, & dedication\u2014the best of their profession. We are facing a paralysis of our health care system. Change Healthcare's cyberattack & data breach is causing ripple effects & soon patients will be deprived of quality care. UnitedHealth Group must issue robust financial assistance to providers & HHS must hold UHG accountable. As March Madness begins, I\u2019m demanding that sports betting companies stop targeting problem gamblers with promotions & pitches, spreading addiction & tragedy. Instead, they should offer treatment, & tools to self-exclude. My GRIT Act would provide federal resources for treatment & research to address gambling addiction\u2014half of revenue from the excise tax on betting. A small fraction of the federal budget, it could make a big difference. Federal resources could help tremendously important work of impressive organizations like Wheeler Clinic, No Kidding Social Club, & CT Renaissance, which I visited today. They\u2019re providing much needed counseling, peer support, role models, & more to recovering gambling addicts. Massive crowds. Brilliant sunshine. Abundant green. Greenwich did the Irish proud in its St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade. Thank you AOH! Ribbon cutting for the new Cure Rare Disease lab in Woodbridge was deeply moving\u2014enabled by million federal grant we secured. It will help develop genetic treatments for brave, strong heroes like Conner Curran, in his fight against Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Commissioning of the USS Idaho attests to the unmatched skill of CT shipbuilders\u2014a national defense platform unexcelled in power, versatility, & stealth, & strength. I will fight for subs a year to ensure our national security. Nick DeCerbo says he\u2019s \u201cdone the hard part,\u201d namely \u201cthe first years\u201d & \u201cthe next are easy.\u201d Great sense of humor! He fought in Patton\u2019s Army & behind enemy lines during WWII. Proud to present a flag & Certificate of Recognition. Magnificent monumental win for the Huskies. Grit, guts, grace\u2014& spectacular skill & strength! True champions. Meriden\u2019s annual St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade had the luck of the Irish\u2014great weather, crowds, & energy. Congrats to Grand Marshal Michael Collins & wonderful AOH organizers. Boeing has a problem. It\u2019s a safety problem bigger than one plane, one airline, or one incident. It\u2019s a systemic safety culture problem. Boeing must face it & solve it\u2014with the FAA & Congress making sure it does. Great day with Project IMO Base Camp. in federal funding helped open the doors of this program that creates a safe space for teens & paves the way for bright futures. Thanks to for sponsoring the program & providing invaluable services to Willimantic youth. This federal grant is a tremendous recognition of the importance of social & emotional learning. Thrilled Regional Youth Adult Social Action Partnership & Bridgeport Public Schools will be able to expand this educational tool\u2014making schools a more peaceful place to learn. I\u2019m joining a strong bipartisan message to Qatar\u2014that if Hamas refuses reasonable negotiations, Qatar should quit hosting this terrorist organization in Doha. As a safe haven, Qatar has key leverage\u2014use it. Meeting yesterday with Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, we were deeply inspired by his \u2019s magnificent work, including its first boat delivery\u2014 hundreds of tons of food arriving at a quickly built jetty. Hopefully, it will accelerate American efforts to deliver aid by sea & other means.", "Any additional funding for Ukraine must come with strong enforcement mechanisms to force to use the authority he has to secure our southern border. I hope House Republicans will make that a priority. Look at the cause and effect: this massive problem was sparked by Obama\u2019s DACA, essentially solved by Trump, and now exploding thanks to Biden and Democrats\u2019 open border policies. We need a president who actually wants to solve the crisis at the southern border. After the miserably failed response to COVID engineered in part by the World Health Organization, any agreement enters into with the WHO should come before the U.S. Senate for debate and a vote on ratification. The news media can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) connect the dots that massive deficit spending is the cause of inflation. It\u2019s why a dollar you held at the beginning of the Biden administration is now worth It\u2019s why people are struggling to buy homes and even groceries.\u2026 The federal government is completely out of control. Unfortunately, most members of Congress are not interested in conducting oversight of the largest financial entity in the world. We are plundering and mortgaging our children\u2019s future with reckless abandon. It is immoral, and\u2026 I appreciate delaying delivery of Articles of Impeachment so that the Senate can fulfill its constitutional duty and hold a trial. wants to ignore precedent and table the Articles so he can hide the disastrous results of Democrats\u2019 open border policy. Wondering why you can\u2019t afford a house? Massive deficit spending sparking inflation, which drives up the cost of homes and mortgage payments. \u2019s student loan debt forgiveness spends money we don\u2019t have, further plundering our children\u2019s future. Another example of buying votes and further plundering our children\u2019s future. The inevitable result of living in Joe Biden\u2019s weakened America. I hope the subcommittee will invite Dr. McCullough and others who can describe how science and the journals have been corrupted to testify alongside the journal editors. Looking forward to attending \u2019s Weaponization Symposium with government skeptics, investigators, and fellow patriots. . is either detached from reality, or completely detached from what his White House staff is doing. Actually, both are most likely true. Hoping everyone has a blessed Easter. This has to be a sick joke. If it isn't, we truly need God's help to end this madness. My sincere condolences to the family and friends of Senator Joe Lieberman. He was a gentleman and patriot who truly loved America. I\u2019ve been saying for years that and the Democrats\u2019 catastrophic open border policy is a clear and present danger to America. The ISIS attack in Moscow has awakened some \u2014 will it take a horrific terror attack here to cause Biden to finally secure our border? I hope not.\u2026 Excellent summary of why had to settle with COVID heroes (doctors who had the courage and compassion to treat COVID patients) to avoid legal discovery. Enjoyed meeting with Shannon and Yusuf today. These two gentlemen have successfully turned their lives around, and are helping others in Milwaukee follow their fine example. . and won\u2019t say this is a crisis, they\u2019ll only say it\u2019s a \u201cchallenge.\u201d No, Mr. President, this is an invasion, and you\u2019re doing nothing to protect America. projected deficits: Obama = t Trump = t Biden = t Biden = t Biden = t Biden = t And claims he\u2019s cutting the deficit trillion. Have we ever had a more dishonest President? Now that it's been exposed, will Democrats try to quietly strip the earmark like they did with Fetterman's sex club earmark last time? The evidence of the corruption of the Biden Crime Family is overwhelming. Democrats can bring in their convicted felon witnesses who lie, but the truth of the matter is that we have the documents showing the Bidens\u2019 corruption and influence peddling. . continues to withhold information that the American public deserves. won't even tell us why.

Members of Congress should take the Hippocratic Oath: \"First, do no harm.\" The federal government is more likely to cause or exacerbate problems than to solve them. has caused a LOT of harm. Sad that 's OMB Director did not know how much their massive deficit spending has degraded the value of the dollar. A dollar at the start of the Biden administration is now worth only We are screwed. The Biden administration is proud of a budget plan that\u2026 My sincere condolences to all the families and friends of the victims of this tragic accident. Democrats' open border is not only facilitating the business model of human, sex, and drug traffickers. is using taxpayer dollars to fund the NGOs who help orchestrate the invasion of military-aged men from China and other adversarial nations. That\u2026 Senate Republicans need to decide what we stand for and what we'll fight for. We need leaders who will not only articulate a clear mission, principles, and goals but will lead our conference in faithfully adhering to them. Q: Why won't Democrats, who control the \"world's greatest deliberative body,\" allow votes on germane amendments? A: Because they want an open border \u2013 even at the cost of American lives \u2013 and they don't want that truth exposed. The SOTU was a speech given by an angry old man. He can't defend his policies that opened our border, sparked high inflation, weakened America, and emboldened our adversaries. So he lashes out and blames others. Pathetic. Hey Joe, how about starting by making Hunter pay HIS fair share? If everything\u2019s so great, why is so angry. Weird. President Biden will try to put lipstick on this pig, but there is not enough lipstick in the world to cover up the disaster of this administration and Democrat governance. Tonight, President Biden should not only say her name, he should announce his support for the Laken Riley Act. The number one issue right now in America is Biden's open border. The high inflation has sparked has made your dollar worth only Americans are feeling the pain of this administration, and it's not going away. It's time to recognize reality. Putin will not lose. Instead of sending billion to fuel a bloody stalemate, any support should be focused on bringing Putin to the negotiating table to end this destructive war. This is an invasion, and is having American taxpayers pick up the tab. Democrats know exactly what they want: grow government while plundering our kids\u2019 future, open borders, destroy our fossil fuel industry, and divide America for political advantage. Elected Republicans need leadership that will effectively counter the left\u2019s destructive policies\u2026 Every additional day under the Biden administration and Democrat governance, America becomes less recognizable.

But this article shows that service is actually getting worse with each new dollar spent. We need Cameron in the House!

My heart goes out to all affected by the tragic Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. I extend my deepest gratitude to the brave first responders. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the entire community during this difficult time. They are more concerned with shoveling the money out the door than they are with the death of this young woman, and trying to prevent this from happening to other people.

Republicans exposed the crisis and \u2019s willful dereliction.", "The Biden admin is again weaponizing the tax code against American energy producers. The president\u2019s plan would raise energy prices for Louisiana families even higher. The Biden admin is punishing non-union employers, and that makes it harder for Louisianians to find jobs and build careers on their own terms. Louisianians fall down times and get up when floods come on the heels of hurricanes. I saw that firsthand today when I caught up with heroes like Ms. Geraldine in Carencro. We\u2019re not talking about some snow-bro who eats Chicken McNuggets and smokes weed and has an opinion here\u2014It\u2019s the U.S. HOUSE that has thoroughly investigated the border crisis and impeached Sec. Mayorkas. And Sen. Schumer wants to violate years of precedent to avoid a trial. You don\u2019t have to be Mensa material to understand that when you spend the extraordinary amounts of money Pres. Biden has spent, you\u2019re going to have inflation. These subpoenas are unlawful, and the threat they represent is unethical. Senate Democrats are trying to punish and defame the Supreme Court because they can\u2019t control it. The American people deserve to hear the evidence through a Senate trial in the Court of Impeachment. Our letter urging Sen. Schumer to do the right thing: If Senate Democrats bury the charges against Sec. Mayorkas, they\u2019re telling the American people that they endorse the lawlessness and misery that Biden admin's broken border has brought to this country. Woke medical schools are prioritizing race and gender over saving lives. I\u2019m glad to work with to introduce the EDUCATE Act in the Senate and help get it passed here. Thanks for sounding the alarm, ! Sec. Mayorkas said that the Biden admin is now THINKING about taking steps to secure the border. I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t do it years ago. Woke universities force future doctors to care more about race & gender than saving lives. The EDUCATE Act ensures taxpayer dollars don\u2019t fund med schools that discriminate against students or peddle identity politics. Senate Democrats are blocking an impeachment trial because they say the evidence doesn\u2019t support the House\u2019s allegations against Sec. Mayorkas. How do they know if they haven\u2019t heard the evidence? Too many people in Washington are deeply weird, nauseously woke, and they hate everyone from George Washington to Mr. Potato Head. The only people I can think of in this country who are better off today than they were four years ago are illegal immigrants. \"Anywhere from to million illegal aliens have entered the U.S. during the Biden If Senate Democrats ignore Sec. Mayorkas\u2019s impeachment, they will have placed their seal of approval on the lawlessness at the border and the chaos it has brought to so many American communities. Becky and I are praying for all Louisianians affected by the tornadoes and bad weather in our state. Senate Democrats may try to dismiss the impeachment charges against Sec. Mayorkas, but they can\u2019t sweep the Biden #BorderCrisis under the rug\u2014not even a rug as big as the United States of America. A majority of the American people think that, as a result of Sec. Mayorkas and Pres. Biden's behavior, our southern border is an open bleeding wound. And they believe that this chaos is by design. Democrats\u2019 efforts to bury the #BorderCrisis impeachment articles without a full trial is unconscionable. It ranks right up there with getting rid of the filibuster. Tornado warning issued for south Louisiana. Please follow local guidelines and stay safe! If Republicans were trying to bury impeachment articles like Senate Democrats are doing, the media would be catatonic and foaming at the mouth in outrage. Nicolas Maduro is on track to make billion selling Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas\u2014because Pres. Biden lifted the sanctions on Maduro\u2019s regime. The Biden admin would rather let dictators pump their oil than allow America to use our own energy resources. My office and our local passport agency are hosting an event tomorrow to help Louisianians apply for or renew their passports. It\u2019s a great opportunity to plan ahead and make sure your summer travel isn\u2019t affected by unexpected delays. School and office closures are in effect around Louisiana due to weather conditions. Stay safe, folks! Friends, please take care as we face severe weather threats throughout our state. Visit for road closure updates. Friends in NELA, please take precautions during this flash flood warning. Senate Democrats are treating the articles of impeachment against Sec. Mayorkas like spam that landed in their inbox. Meanwhile, the border crisis is bringing death, drugs, violence, chaos, criminals, and mayhem into American neighborhoods. A study found that roughly of people who received transgender treatment If the figure holds, gender activists will have wrongfully mutilated or sterilized more than American children from alone. The Biden admin has repeatedly waived sanctions on Iran, and they just did it weeks after Iran killed American soldiers. Every dollar Pres. Biden gives Iran access to will support terrorism aimed at Americans and our allies. In Pres. Biden\u2019s America, it feels like inflation is turning toilet paper and frozen pizza into luxury goods. It would be more intellectually honest if Sec. Mayorkas would just say he believes in open borders. When it comes to the Biden border crisis, Senate Democrats seem to think it's a brave new world, and they want to set a dangerous new precedent\u2014by burying the Mayorkas impeachment. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics () decided today to block biological men from competing in women\u2019s sports. It\u2019s the correct decision. Even Pres. Biden\u2019s former Chief of Staff admits that prices are high and \u201cpeople feel that pinch.\u201d The problem is that Biden\u2019s policies are the ones doing the pinching. Sec. Mayorkas told me he thinks the situation at the border is \u201cvery serious.\u201d So why hasn\u2019t he taken common-sense steps to fix it? America already has a solution to student debt: It\u2019s called a job. Pres. Biden lost his last student loan scheme at the Supreme Court. But now, he\u2019s trying to buy votes again. Sec. Mayorkas told me he\u2019s trying really hard to secure the border. The numbers tell us he\u2019s failing. Illegal immigrants have attempted to break into our country more than MILLION times under Pres. Biden\u2019s watch. It\u2019s clear that the Biden admin believes in open borders. Thanks to for a great conversation: illegal immigrants broke into our country. The Biden admin caught them and released them. So they started squatting in an American home. We\u2019re hosting an event this Thursday to help constituents apply for or renew their passports before the summer rush. There was a ceasefire on Oct. and six months ago today, Hamas terrorists chose to end it. Pres. Biden must stand with Israel until Hamas is in ruins. Congratulations to and Coach on another well-played and successful When Hurricane Ida struck Jefferson Parish, Louisianians bravely weathered the storm. This will help cover the costs of disaster recovery management in our communities. It hasn\u2019t even been months since Oct. Hamas is still holding AMERICAN hostages. Israel must destroy Hamas, and Pres. Biden should stop making it harder for the only democracy in the Middle East to take out unrepentant terrorists. Much of the transgender movement has spiraled into deep insanity. Louisiana is full of compassion and common sense. We know the transgender agenda is dangerous and outrageous. So does the United Kingdom. Because of Pres. Biden\u2019s economic blunders, keeping a roof over your head in Louisiana costs an extra every month. If we discovered life on Mars tomorrow, Pres. Biden would send it money. But the president\u2019s reckless spending isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s crippling Louisianians. In opening up the southern border, Pres. Biden and the Democrat party have summoned spirits that they can\u2019t control. Hurricane Ida damaged Terrebonne Parish schools, and Delta pummeled many of our state buildings. This will help Louisianians rebuild our communities. He is Risen! Becky and I wish Louisianians a happy and blessed #Easter! Today, we reflect on the sacrifice Jesus Christ made to save us from sin. Have a blessed #GoodFriday. The Laken Riley Act is one more attempt by Republicans to stem the chaos at border\u2014because that chaos is hurting innocent people in Louisiana. Pres. Biden and Sec. Mayorkas have QUADRUPLED the monthly rate of illegal immigrants pouring into our country. The new estimate says there are MILLION illegal immigrants in America. Secure the border Louisiana families are burning through cash every time they go to the grocery store. Food costs them an extra every month in Pres. Biden\u2019s America. Pres. Biden and his minions have politicized our judicial system by prosecuting one of their political opponents right before an election. That\u2019s the sort of thing that happens in countries whose Powerball jackpot is chickens and a goat. This is a dangerous precedent. The North American Wetlands Conservation Act is an important step to preserve Louisiana's wildlife and protect our environment\u2019s natural defense system. It\u2019s always a pleasure to get back to real America and chat with the Livingston Parish Chamber of Commerce. Make no mistake: The border is chaotic by design. Democrats clearly believe in no distinction between legal and illegal immigration. The Green New Deal agenda isn\u2019t a plan. It\u2019s a fantasy. Because countries like China, Russia, and Iran expect America to pay TRILLIONS for all of it\u2014and so does Pres. Biden. You shouldn\u2019t highlight your opinion if you can\u2019t defend it. Every month, Louisiana households are losing an extra to higher energy costs because of the Biden admin\u2019s failures. This Democrat witness\u2019s testimony reminds me of the celebrities who incessantly lecture hardworking Americans . . . but then have to lie down if they think too hard. IRS bureaucrats should have no control over Louisiana families. But now Biden wants to give the IRS even more power. Friends, a Flood Advisory is in effect until PM CT for Ouachita, Caldwell, Winn, LaSalle, Grant, E Jackson and SE Natchitoches Parishes. Please take caution. Pres. Biden\u2019s State of the Union speech the state of the Union today can best be seen at the grocery store and at the southern border. Summer is coming up, which means many Louisianians need to apply for or renew their passports. We're hosting an event to help constituents enjoy their summer travel plans without unexpected delays. Hurricane Ida ripped through Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, and Hurricane Laura wreaked havoc in Calcasieu Parish. This will help Louisianians in south Louisiana continue restoring their communities. When Hurricane Ida hit, she battered community buildings and local infrastructure that folks in SELA have had to rebuild. This will support recovery work that Jefferson & Terrebonne Parishes have been doing for the last years. As we look forward to Easter next week, Becky and I wish Louisiana a blessed #PalmSunday honoring Jesus\u2019 arrival into Jerusalem. Adeel Mangi is not qualified to be a federal judge because he supports organizations that celebrate people who kill law enforcement officers, hate Americans, and hate Jews. It\u2019s not Islamophobic to recognize that. It\u2019s our job. Judge Maldonado wants to ban assault weapons but can\u2019t define what one is. Most of my Democratic colleagues who are paying attention understand that too many of Pres. Biden\u2019s judicial nominees aren\u2019t qualified to judge a pie eating contest. These projects would bring construction jobs to our state and provide more options for reliable, clean energy to Louisianians. I hope the House joins us in voting to save these hydropower projects ASAP. Of all district judges confirmed last Congress, Judge Maldonado has the THIRD WORST record when it comes to issuing rulings in a timely manner. But Pres. Biden wants to promote her to an appellate court. Why? No matter what the Obama judge says, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have the right to own a firearm. Foreign nationals who are in our country illegally are not Americans. Duh. The Senate just unanimously passed my common-sense solution to help the private sector & federal officials work together to better respond to hurricanes and other emergencies. I\u2019ll keep working to get Louisianians the help they need when disaster strikes. For a state with a median household income around losing to Biden-flation is a world of pain. Democrats want to spend TRILLION to become carbon neutral & held a hearing to tell us why. Dem witness: Carbon dioxide is \"a huge part of our atmosphere.\" Me: \"It\u2019s actually a very small part of our atmosphere.\" Dem witness: \"Well, okay. But, yeah. I don\u2019t know.\" Democrats' witnesses support abortion up until the moment a child is born. Many Louisianians are still recovering from Hurricane Ida\u2019s damage. This will help repair electric lines in south Louisiana and support Lafourche Parish Hospital\u2019s continued recovery. Small businesses create good jobs. Big Biden government shouldn\u2019t crowd out private lenders that are already doing a good job getting funds to the small businesses that need them. Biden judge: \u201cAssault weapons may be banned because they're extraordinary dangers and are not appropriate for legitimate self-defense purposes.\u201d The same Biden judge: \u201cI am not a gun expert.\u201d Razor wire won't hurt you unless you try to go over it or through it. So I've never understood politically why Pres. Biden wants to oppose barriers at the southern border\u2014other than the fact that he really does believe in open borders. Some of my Democratic colleagues call folks who are in our country illegally \u201cundocumented Americans.\u201d They're not undocumented Americans. They're foreign nationals, and they're in our country illegally. Last year\u2019s drought hammered Louisiana\u2019s crawfish producers. I joined the Louisiana delegation in urging the SBA to help our crawfish producers get the help they need. Louisiana\u2019s small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and they deserve a fair shot at working with the federal government. Here\u2019s one thing I\u2019m doing to make that happen: Real wages just can\u2019t keep up with #Bidenflation. So, hardworking Louisianians feel like they\u2019re running a race they can\u2019t win. It\u2019s impossible to fully undo the effects of cross-sex hormones or heal the scars of mastectomies or genital surgeries. So why do some activists insist that parents rush kids into sex-change surgeries and inject them with sterilizing drugs? Becky and I wish Louisiana all the Luck of the Irish we can muster this #StPatricksDay! Sometimes I think that the Biden White House would lower the average IQ of an entire city. You can't borrow and spend the kind of money that Pres. Biden has without causing inflation. This is basic ECON Why are energy costs up almost under Pres. Biden? He\u2019s spent years bowing to neo-socialists who think America has no right to be energy independent. TikTok hasn\u2019t proven that the Communist Party of China doesn't have access to our data. Leftist leaders put wokeness above learning, and Americans are facing a real crisis: of fourth graders can\u2019t read Pres. Biden and Sec. Mayorkas may want to let dangerous lawbreakers come roam America illegally, but Congress doesn't. The Laken Riley Act would get criminal aliens out of our country before they victimize more Americans. Hurricane Ida left many in southeast Louisiana without a safe place to work. I\u2019m grateful this will help cover the costs of temporary offices in Houma. When waterways overflow, Louisianians\u2019 homes and businesses are at risk of serious damage. I\u2019m grateful to see that this will reduce the risk of flooding in Concordia Parish. The Biden admin wants to limit Americans\u2019 freedom to get affordable, short-term health insurance plans that fit their needs. My Patients Choice Act would make sure bureaucrats can\u2019t force Louisianians to pay more for insurance through Obamacare. #Bidenflation is literally eating Louisianians out of house and home. The Senate cannot and should not turn a deaf ear to the democratically elected members of the House by dismissing their charges against Secretary Mayorkas without a full and fair trial. Louisiana families don\u2019t have an extra to burn every month. But that\u2019s what #Bidenflation now costs them. Left-of-Lenin wokers can\u2019t wake up to reality fast enough. The United Kingdom, Sweden, Luxembourg, Finland, Denmark, and Belgium have all prohibited sex reassignment surgeries for children. Other countries are proving themselves wiser than America. Unelected bureaucrats shouldn\u2019t be able to strip veterans of their Second Amendment rights unilaterally. Because my legislation is now law, veterans will get the due process they deserve to protect their freedom. The majority of Americans support building the WALL. Meanwhile, the Biden admin remains addicted to its open border. Any fair-minded American knows that Pres. Biden\u2019s guiding principle has been, \u201cLet's do the dumbest thing possible that won't work.\u201d And it\u2019s now costing Louisiana families every year. If the Senate dismisses the impeachment charges against Sec. Mayorkas without a trial, it will set a new and boldly anti-democratic precedent. Pres. Biden\u2019s pretty words can\u2019t hide his price hikes: Grocery store staples cost Americans more under his economic mismanagement. The Biden admin has been breathtakingly awful.#SOTU Pres. Biden seems to have more respect for the \u2018rights\u2019 of illegal immigrants than for those of loving parents and of unborn children. The president\u2019s policies fail because his priorities are backwards. Insanity has consequences, and Pres. Biden would rather allow those consequences to hamstring American families than admit his mistakes and change course. Thanks to Bidenomics, Louisiana families are paying an extra every month just to make ends meet. Pres. Biden created the border and then ignored it. His admin let the border wall languish and paroled MILLIONS of aliens into the country illegally. Tonight, Louisianians will be thinking, \u2018Nice try, President Biden\u2019 because they know that he\u2019s replaced the American Dream with high prices, open borders, energy dependence AND rampant crime. Any fair-minded person can see that the House\u2019s impeachment charges against Sec. Mayorkas are serious and demand a full, fair trial. Crawfish are a big part of Louisiana culture, but a bad drought has devastated local farmers\u2019 businesses. My CRAWDAD Act would help give our farmers the emergency relief they need to keep putting crawfish on our tables. Kids change their minds. That\u2019s why God gave them parents. No sane person would give an anorexic teenager Ozempic or staple her stomach because she thinks she\u2019s fat. But gender activists rush to inject girls with irreversible cross-sex hormones and inflict double mastectomies on them\u2014all in the quest to \u201caffirm\u201d gender confusion. The SEC\u2019s CAT could put the personal data of Americans at risk. That\u2019s why I introduced a bill to protect Americans from this prying database and demanded the SEC investigate the CAT\u2019s privacy risks. Transgender surgeries are mutilating and sterilizing America\u2019s sons and daughters. Doctors cut out healthy organs from minors to build a pile of flesh that may never regain full sensation or function properly. It\u2019s barbaric. Today\u2019s SCOTUS decision is a victory for the rule of law, the Constitution, and common sense. Protecting democracy means letting Americans vote for who they want. Hurricane Laura rocked southwest Louisiana and the facilities that provide folks with electricity. This will help cover the cost of getting the local electric system back online. Democrats held a hearing on abortion. When I walked them through the violent steps doctors take to kill a baby at weeks, a Democrat cut me off. If abortion is too horrific for liberals to even hear about, shouldn\u2019t they agree it\u2019s too horrific to . and I believe that Louisianians shouldn\u2019t have to live in fear when pumping their gas, getting groceries, or walking in their own neighborhoods. Louisiana\u2019s crime wave didn\u2019t appear overnight\u2014our last administration wrote it into law. Now, I\u2019m glad to see our state lawmakers and leaders making progress to take back our streets from criminals. The FDA is putting women and babies in danger by making abortion pills available by mail\u2014without so much as a doctor\u2019s visit. It\u2019s reckless. It\u2019s also illegal. can\u2019t drive. They can\u2019t get a tattoo. They can\u2019t see an R-rated movie by themselves. But children can begin taking cross-sex hormones\u2014which could leave them sterile for life\u2014at age This insanity is dangerous. \u201cDo you support abortion up to the moment of birth?\u201d Democrats\u2019 witness: \u201cThat's a really hard question to answer.\u201d No, it\u2019s not.#ProLife If a tells you he\u2019s a NASCAR driver, you don\u2019t give him the keys to your sedan. But activists pressure parents to affirm gender confusion and subject their kids to life-altering surgeries and hormone treatments. Yet another \"'known associate' of a terrorist organization\" tried to cross the border this month. How many people on the terror watchlist need to be caught at the border before Pres. Biden acts? Louisiana\u2019s crawfish farmers have worked hard to weather a bad freeze and devastating drought. My CRAWDAD Act would give mudbug farmers the help they need to keep delivering quality Louisiana fare to crawfish lovers everywhere. The Biden admin has been a conga line of failures. With Pres. Biden, Americans can only look forward to more hurt\u2014inflation, crime in the streets, the open bleeding wound at the border, our enemies no longer respecting us, and the sacrifice of our energy independence. Since Oct., Chinese immigrants have tried to break into America illegally through Pres. Biden\u2019s broken border. Who knows how many Communist spies have already crossed into the U.S because of his love for the #OpenBorder? Congress passed the First Step Act, and the federal govt released criminals. The Bureau of Prisons couldn\u2019t even tell me how many of them committed more crimes or if officials bothered to warn victims that the criminals got a free pass. The incompetence is breathtaking. An illegal immigrant has been arrested for brutally attacking multiple people in Louisiana. I\u2019m praying for the victims and demanding Pres. Biden stop putting out a welcome mat for criminal aliens who sneak into America and victimize innocent people. \u201cDo you support abortion up to the moment of birth?\u201d Dems\u2019 abortion expert: \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d In fact, abortion up to the moment of birth is legal in Vermont, New Jersey, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Alaska, and Washington, DC. \u201c'Reproductive justice is economic justice.' Do you agree with that?\u201d Dems' expert: \u201cI do agree with that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not true for the baby, is it? . . . There is no economic justice for the baby because the baby's dead, right?\u201d Dems' expert: \u201cI don't really know how to answer.\u201d America is boiling over with some of the most radical pediatric gender policies on Earth. Activists want to put children under the knife or pump them full of hormones before kids have a chance to grasp the costs. If you want to know where Democrats\u2019 soft border policies are taking America, just look at NY: \u201cMore than hotels have been converted into emergency shelters, at an estimated cost topping billion.\u201d Nothing disturbs me more than the notion that a child\u2019s upbringing should be determined by some bureaucrat rather than by the child\u2019s parents. Especially when those bureaucrats use the power of the government to maim children. It makes me want to throw up. Illegal aliens are charged with violently attacking people in Louisiana, Georgia, NY, and across the country. That\u2019s why the Senate needs to hold a full, fair trial into what the president\u2019s DHS Secretary has done to fuel this crisis. Any reputable economist who didn\u2019t get his degree from Costco will tell you that Pres. Biden\u2019s economic policies caused both inflation and shrinkflation. Advice from the police as anti-cop policies allow violent crime to surge: \"Stop listening to people who tell you to defund the police. Start listening to citizens, victims and police officers.\u201d Makes sense to me. There\u2019s a \u201csurge\u201d of \u201cSouth American theft groups\u201d hitting American communities. In just a month, at least groups of illegal immigrants have allegedly stolen thousands in goods from businesses in a single small town. The Biden admin\u2019s case against Idaho is the president\u2019s latest scheme to force his radical pro-abortion ideology on all Americans. There\u2019s no legal basis to overrule a law Idahoans passed democratically. #ProLife Under Pres. Biden\u2019s watch, million migrants have tried to cross the southern border illegally. My bill would give judges a critical tool to help them better manage their overwhelmed dockets and cut down on the backlog of immigration cases. Chicago is a \u201csanctuary city,\u201d and its citizens say, \u201cWe are at our wits\u2019 end.\u201d Woke immigration policies have led to illicit drug use, prostitution, shoplifting, and trash strewn about local neighborhoods. Pres. Biden\u2019s economic policies have been reliably and dependably wrong. That\u2019s why the president is polling right up there with chlamydia. Among y/o kids, sex change operations are spiking. Instead of protecting children from irreversible damage, Wokers are encouraging them to make life altering decisions. Hurricane Ida dealt a tough blow to south Louisiana\u2019s electrical infrastructure. I\u2019m grateful to see this help rebuild the roads that support these communities. A new survey says Pres. Biden\u2019s poll numbers are on a journey to the center of the earth. What\u2019s driving the plunge? His choice to keep the border wide open. \u201cNasty as they come.\u201d That describes the migrant gang member responsible for car jackings, robberies at gunpoint, and more. The has paved the way for migrant gangs who apparently came to America to terrorize our cities. The Biden admin\u2019s Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) could put Americans\u2019 data at risk. The appeals court should stop the madness before bad actors exploit the CAT to hurt innocent Americans. Hurricanes hit SELA and SWLA so hard that they\u2019re still rebuilding. I\u2019m grateful this will help Louisianians in Jefferson Davis and Lafouche as well as at NOLA\u2019s Temple Sinai recover. The Biden #BorderCrisis is dangerous, outrageous, and avoidable. The Senate needs to hold a full, fair trial into this crisis and its causes. The Biden admin wants to keep states from using TANF funding to help crisis pregnancy centers. Our Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act would stop the loon wing of the president\u2019s party from coming after centers that protect life. I played a little basketball back in the day, but not as well as the Lady Tigers! Congratulations to and Coach for bringing home a great win against Auburn! #GeauxTigers Hurricanes Ida and Laura and severe winter storms have left parishes throughout our state with damage. I\u2019m grateful for this which will help Louisianians rebuild and recover. On day one, the Biden admin repealed common-sense border security measures. Since then, CBP has seen more than MILLION encounters at our southern border. Like I said in December, Pres. Biden has sent the Senate some awful nominations, but his pick of Adeel Mangi to the Court of Appeals is one of the worst. Here\u2019s why: The Biden admin's priorities: Using taxpayer money to fund a study that gives monthly \u201cmicrogrants\u201d to transgender people because COVID supposedly hit them especially hard. Want to impress your Valentine with a nice steak dinner? Under Pres. Biden\u2019s bad economic policies, that steak will cost you more. Chocolate covered strawberries are a sweet #ValentinesDay tradition, but the bitter truth is that they now cost Americans more under #Bidenflation. On #AshWednesday, Becky and I wish all who observe Lent a season full of prayer and reflection. #Bidenomics is breaking hearts: Even cookie prices are up from when Pres. Biden took office. Wishing my friends in South Louisiana a very happy Courir de Mardi Gras. May you find all your gumbo ingredients and remember to laissez les bons temps rouler! I\u2019m grateful for this which will help Louisianians in New Orleans rebuild after Hurricane Ida and folks surrounding the Sabine River recover from severe flooding. Wishing all Louisianians a happy and safe #MardiGras! Laissez les bons temps rouler! Too many times, Pres. Biden has been a sock puppet for a faction of neo-socialists who want to destroy America\u2019s hard-earned energy independence. . joined Alphonse and me at my office for a friendly King Cake Challenge. There\u2019s no denying that Louisiana is the best place in the world to eat a little king cake and spend Mardi Gras. Pres. Biden is committing energy suicide. Too many times in the past years, we\u2019ve seen Pres. Biden act as a sock puppet for a faction of neo-socialists who don't like our country and have turned its sights on America\u2019s hard-fought energy independence. Hurricane Ida struck New Orleans and left many buildings with damage. I\u2019m thankful to see that this will help the St. Joan of Arc School recover from the storm. The VICTIM Act would provide law enforcement with key support to help bring violent criminals to justice and give victims closure. I asked Pres. Biden\u2019s latest nominee to the federal bench about an interview in which she said, \u201cI was in my Marxist phase.\u201d I asked whether she was still a Marxist, and she immediately replied, \u201cI had no idea that that interview was something that was going to be published.\" I asked Sec. Yellen if the high prices caused by Bidenomics are here to stay. Her answer: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to get these prices down.\u201d Apparently the Biden admin\u2019s position is that, if Americans don\u2019t get a big pay raise, they\u2019re screwed. Judges are trying to give priority to lawyers based on their race or sex rather than on the merits of the case or the importance of the oral argument. This policy is both unethical and Biden-flation has robbed Louisiana families of nearly on average. Even if price hikes stop today, those families won\u2019t get their money back. Pres. Biden\u2019s policy would end TANF funding for crisis pregnancy centers in LA\u2014that provide vital care to expecting moms. Our bill would ensure these community resources get the support they need to serve vulnerable women & The border bill is as dead as Woodrow Wilson. I will vote against the deal when the Senate formally kills it today. If Pres. Biden really wants to secure the border, he can change his policies and follow the law. Every day that Pres. Biden is in office, the American dream becomes less affordable for American families. Under #Bidenomics: \u2022 mortgage rates are up more than \u2022 Average used car prices are up \u2022 Median house prices are up \u00adHurricane Ida\u2019s storm surge hit Jefferson Parish hard. I\u2019m grateful to see this help cover Louisianians\u2019 recovery costs. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees is not working for the Palestinians. They're working for Hamas. It\u2019s inexcusable. The Biden admin has to STOP funding the UNRWA. The Biden admin keeps yielding to the demands of radical climate extremists. It\u2019s putting Louisiana jobs and our national security at risk. We won\u2019t allow the Biden Energy Department to wage war on American LNG without a fight. Under Pres. Biden, most people are barely getting by because of high prices caused by Bidenomics. Now, fewer than half of Americans could afford to pay in an emergency . . . In just months, Border Patrol agents in Texas caught known child predators trying to enter our country illegally. Imagine how many we don\u2019t know about. Is our technology greater than our humanity? A question social media platforms need to answer. We know where these attacks are coming from: Iran and the terrorist groups it sponsors. Iran is able to financially support these terrorists because Pres. Biden isn\u2019t enforcing sanctions against its oil. Welcoming Bishop Philip Mounstephen to the Capitol was an honor. Religious freedom is under threat across the globe, and I\u2019m thankful for courageous voices like the Bishop of Winchester who defend that liberty and the men and women who suffer oppression for their faith. Social media platforms have become a killing field for the truth. Their algorithms target users with content that plays on their emotions without their consent. The Don\u2019t Push My Buttons Act would keep social media accountable for polarizing and provoking. It\u2019s unconscionable that our government would use American taxpayer dollars to fund research that exploits or depends on the taking of innocent life. If the Biden admin won\u2019t stop this immorality, Congress should.#ProLife I\u2019m glad to see that HSGAC unanimously passed our common-sense solution to help the private sector and DHS work better together to respond to emergencies. I look forward to the Senate sending this critical bill to the House. There's no question that these social media platforms are harming our children in very specific ways. We have bills that would create legal liability for the platforms when they allow this child sex exploitation and that would pass if put before the entire Senate. The Peace and Tolerance in Palestinian Education Act would ensure that not a single U.S. taxpayer dollar goes to schools that teach young children the same hate that inspired the Oct. attacks against Israel. . employees actively participated in massacring Israeli civilians on Oct. The U.S. shouldn't bankroll a group that helped Hamas attack our greatest ally in the Middle East, and the Biden admin shouldn't turn a blind eye to its #BorderCrisis. Mexico\u2019s cartels have been exploiting our open border to terrorize Americans for years. Their weapon of choice is fentanyl. Louisiana lost more than loved ones to fentanyl poisoning in alone. The recent hacking of 's X account proves just how badly Americans need the Protecting Investors\u2019 Personally Identifiable Information Act to safeguard their sensitive data. The risk is clearer than ever, and so is Congress\u2019s responsibility to act. Pres. Biden and the loon wing of his party just believe in open borders. They believe that anyone who wants to ought to be able to come into the U.S. without any vetting. Pres. Biden is trying to stop LNG permits, and it is bone-deep, stupid. Hurricane Laura and other storms have rocked SWLA, and this will help Calcasieu Parish rebuild and stay resilient in the face of future storms. grams of fentanyl will kill people. This will get dealers only years minimum in prison. grams of meth\u2014which may not kill anybody\u2014also gets a dealer years. My Fairness in Fentanyl Sentencing Act would correct this disparity. With his new attack on LNG, Pres. Biden is intentionally killing jobs and threatening our national security to placate confused climate extremists. Louisiana is no stranger to natural disasters, and our people need help when the unthinkable happens. Our bill would enable the private sector and FEMA to help Louisianians more effectively, for the long haul. \u201cWhat it cost me to make a large pot of gumbo, I\u2019m gonna get maybe three-fourths of that now at the same cost.\u201d Pres. Biden\u2019s prices may be rising at a slower rate, but they\u2019re still rising\u2014and Louisianians are taking the hit. Pres. Biden\u2019s border policies are not just a human rights disaster. They have also provided the perfect cover for terrorist sympathizers, child sex offenders, and cartel associates to enter the U.S. illegally. The numbers will make you throw up: Louisianians are working hard to recover from hurricane damage and protect their infrastructure from future storms. This will help Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes with their recovery from Ida and help Cameron Parish prepare for future disasters. Pres. Biden nominated someone to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims who has never even argued a motion or tried a case there. \u201cSo, the answer is zero?\u201d \u201cThat is correct, Senator.\u201d For years and years and years and years, New Orleans\u2019 Sewage and Water Board has been a model of inefficiency. We can do one of two things to fix it. Becky and I send our deepest sympathies to our friend John Barrasso on the loss of his wife, Bobbi. She faced cancer with grace and courage, and I know her family misses her dearly. We are keeping the Barrasso family in our prayers. FEMA said that a lot of Louisianians would see their flood insurance premiums decrease. Terrebonne Parish will see a increase. Lafourche Parish: Up Plaquemines Parish: Up FEMA lied. Pres. Biden\u2019s failed border policies have wreaked havoc in every corner of our country, including Louisiana. According to one estimate, Louisianians pay an additional PER illegal migrant\u2014that\u2019s about MILLION per year\u2014in state taxes because of illegal immigration. Mardi Gras season is all about honoring Louisiana\u2019s unique culture. Every year, it\u2019s my honor to welcome our esteemed Queens and Princesses\u2014who hail from every corner of the state\u2014to our nation\u2019s Capitol. We use petrochemicals to make just about everything you can think of\u2014plastic, packaging, medical equipment, and more . . . I\u2019m thankful to the LA Chemical Association for being the biggest job providers in Louisiana, and producing the supplies Americans rely on every day. We need to finish the wall. #BorderCrisis It\u2019s always a pleasure to welcome the good folks of the CENLA Regional Chamber of Commerce to Washington to discuss creating good paying jobs for LA families. I\u2019m grateful to for protecting Louisianians by bringing criminals to justice in Louisiana. It\u2019s time for America to wake up and smell the incompetence: The border is wide open. I read somewhere that if the White House were a football team and performed like this, we would\u2019ve already fired the coach, the athletic director, and the mascot. Sec. Hillary Clinton said it takes a village to raise a child. What she meant was that it takes the federal government to raise a child. No, it doesn't. Parents have the right to raise their children according to their own values. Friends across Louisiana, road closures are underway due to flash flooding throughout the state. Please stay safe and be careful when traveling. Sandbags are available to residents at the following locations as we continue to deal with heavy rain: Acadiana: LA: Securing the border isn\u2019t quantum physics. We\u2019ve done it before. But Pres. Biden keeps fighting us every step of the way. Since Pres. Biden took office, workers in America have lost of their weekly real wages. In other words, it\u2019ll take more than a modest pay raise to make up for #Bidenflation. When are we going finally going to get control of the border? Probably when we change presidential administrations . . . because Pres. Biden and my Democratic colleagues keep throwing up obstacles to our getting a border bill done. Louisiana and America\u2019s brave veterans are underserved because they\u2019re not able to receive both retirement and disability compensation. It is only right that our combat veterans are able to retire peacefully with full benefits for their sacrifices. Hurricanes Ida and Laura and severe storms ripped through Louisiana, and many communities are still rebuilding. I\u2019m grateful to see that this will help Louisianians\u2019 recovery efforts in Natchitoches, Lafourche, and Ascension Parishes. This will sound like common sense to most fair-minded people, but the Biden admin should not ship Americans\u2019 hard-earned taxpayer dollars overseas to fund abortions. Let\u2019s protect life at home and abroad. Update on Louisiana primaries. Thankful to work with , , and on a solution. Few things fill my heart as much as seeing young people travel from every corner of this country to give a voice to the #ProLife All human life, whether it's years or seconds old, is precious. I will never stop defending America\u2019s defenseless unborn children and am proud to receive an A+ rating from . America does not have a shortage of gun laws. We have a shortage of enforcement. Iran is behind all of the unrest in the Middle East. The best way to stop Iran is to choke them economically. Pres. Biden won\u2019t enforce the sanctions on Iranian oil because he thinks it\u2019ll make them mad. But Iran has already said it wants to kill all Jews and all Americans. After the Biden admin took the Houthis off the terrorist designation list, the Iran proxies aimed their aggression at U.S. troops. I urged the pres last year to face facts before the Houthis escalated their attacks on Americans, but he didn\u2019t listen. Officials have arrested CONVICTED MURDERERS crossing our border since October. Violent criminals keep taking advantage of chaos at Pres. Biden\u2019s border because they know the president won\u2019t stop them. Hurricane Ida damaged Houma\u2019s power plant badly. I\u2019m grateful that this will help make sure Houma and nearby parts of Terrebonne Parish have the energy infrastructure they need. Opponents of the Second Amendment have painted themselves into a corner. They want to reduce gun violence, but they think cops are worse than criminals. They want more gun laws, but they don\u2019t want to punish people who break those laws. Because of Pres. Biden\u2019s inflation, people are having to borrow more money and raid their savings. Even if inflation comes down, these high prices are permanent. Hurricane Ida hit SELA hard. I\u2019m thankful to see this allow the people of Jefferson Parish to continue to care for their senior citizens after Ida damaged their facilities. Getting caught with enough fentanyl to kill every man, woman, & child in Knoxville, TN earns a dealer only yrs minimum in prison. We need to crack down on dealers by lowering the threshold for mandatory minimum sentences. My Fairness in Fentanyl Sentencing Act would do that. Sanctuary city leaders are finally admitting just how bad Pres. Biden\u2019s border crisis is. Meanwhile, every American with a shred of common sense is wondering what took them so long. Friends in SWLA, road closures are underway due to weather conditions. Avoid driving if possible, and please visit for updates. In response to the winter storm warning, residents in NELA may now visit warming centers in their region: Louisianians in SELA may now seek shelter at warming stations in their region: Warming centers are also available in Northwest Louisiana: With courage and love, Martin Luther King Jr. helped our country become a more just and perfect union. Friends in North LA who are facing winter weather, please refrain from using roadways unless absolutely necessary. Visit for up-to-date travel guidance. Stay safe and stay warm! It\u2019s pretty clear to Louisianians that parents don\u2019t have a right to mutilate their children irreversibly and that we can protect parents\u2019 rights and vulnerable kids at the same time. The Biden admin has made our southern border a magnet for terrorists and the poster child for human suffering. It\u2019s a national embarrassment and our country's biggest threat. The border is open because Pres. Biden wants it open. Too often, woke officials become catatonic and foam at the mouth when parents make decisions about their own kids' education and upbringing. Congress must protect Moms and Dads, and that is what our bill will do. Because of Bidenomics\u2019 high prices, people in my state have to use their credit card more. People have to spend their savings. Pres Biden\u2019s inflation is a cancer on the American Dream. Common sense is illegal at , yet some of my colleagues failed to protect the privacy of small business owners across America from the Biden woke, invasive rule. Pres. Biden sent us a nominee who didn\u2019t know the basics of the U.S. Constitution. Judge Bjelkengren is right to bow out, but Pres. Biden just keeps trying to put unqualified people on the bench\u2014for life. People who don't know the law have no business running our courtrooms. If the SEC can\u2019t secure its own Twitter (X) account, it can\u2019t expect the MILLION Americans who invest in stocks to trust the agency. The SEC\u2019s CAT database remains a ticking time bomb of sensitive info that hackers would no doubt love to exploit. This illegal immigrant was deported times before a judge put him back onto the streets after his last DUI. Four days later, he allegedly drove drunk AGAIN and killed a mother and her About of the seafood we eat is imported, and failing to inspect foreign shrimp hurts all Americans who love seafood. I wrote a bill to fix the problem easily\u2014for the health and safety of all of us. The Audubon Zoo is one of the top attractions in New Orleans. I\u2019m grateful to see that this will help restore facilities at the park so that families from around the country can continue to enjoy animal Mangi sat on the advisory board of an org that sponsors terrorist propaganda yet claims he wasn't aware of its hateful activities. But turns out he gave it and helped get his firm, Patterson Belknap, to donate twice that. And we're supposed to believe he wasn't aware? The American people aren\u2019t stupid, but they think Pres. Biden is. This president is running out of toes to shoot off, and the border is Exhibit A. Capt Maurice d\u2019Aquin out of Lafitte at Doc's Fishing Charters put me on this huge redfish that we happily released after a min fight! Wishing all Louisianians a happy King\u2019s Day and a festive start to Mardi Gras season! Dr. Claudine Gay doesn\u2019t understand the purpose of a university. The purpose of a university is to make young people think, not to make them comfortable. Iran is shooting missiles at ships, and the Biden administration is quoting Socrates to them. That\u2019s just the way the Biden admin works. Real wages during Pres. Biden\u2019s term are down The only way to control inflation is to stop spending more money than we take in and to stop borrowing money to fill the gap when we don\u2019t. The average American and Louisianian looks at the situation at Harvard and it triggers their gag reflex. It\u2019s time universities go back to being universities instead of factories that espouse, \u201cI hate America.\u201d So far, border negotiations are a multiple vehicle pile-up. My experience is that Democrats are happy with the way things are . . . Being a small biz owner is stressful enough w/o the gov making you answer questions about sexual preferences in order to apply for a loan. We could've protected the personal info of small biz owners from the CFPB's rule, but Pres. Biden vetoed my bill. My hope for the people of Louisiana is that is their best year yet! Becky, Preston, and I wish all Louisianians a very happy New Year. In Louisiana, Pres. Biden is about as popular as herpes. Why is that? reasons: The people of Louisiana are not stupid. They think the Biden admin is. They think its stupidity runs from the river to the sea. Biden has made some bad nominations, but his pick of Adeel Mangi to the Third Circuit is one of the worst. Did Patterson Belknap sponsor the Center at Mangi\u2019s urging? Did the firm\u2019s sponsorship fund these despicable events? If Mangi got his firm to fund the Center, are we still supposed to believe he did so without looking into the types of events it put on? Bottom line: Adeel Mangi sat on the advisory board of a group that marked the anniversary of with an event featuring speakers with ties to actual terrorists. Mangi stayed on the board, and Pres. Biden wants to give him a lifetime seat on an appeals court. Additionally, it seems that Mangi may have misled senators. At his committee hearing, Mangi told me that he only gave advice on academic research. But his firm, Patterson Belknap, is one of the Center\u2019s few \u201cLaw Fellow Sponsors.\u201d The USDA\u2019s purchase of of Gulf shrimp will help Louisiana shrimpers and those in need during this holiday season. The loon wing of the Democratic Party has consumed Pres. Biden and many of my Democratic colleagues. And you see the result of their policies. Pres. Biden says inflation is coming down. What does that mean? Only that prices are rising less quickly. Meanwhile, people are running out of money. Pres. Biden and the loon wing of the Democratic Party believe our border laws are racist and that anybody who wants to come into our country should be able to come into our country. That\u2019s very dangerous and violates the law. Merry Christmas, Louisiana! My family and I are praying that all Louisianians enjoy the peace and joy this season brings. To stop the flow of illegals across the border, all Pres. Biden has to do is: \u2022 Refine the definition of asylum \u2022 Implement Remain in Mexico program and Safe Third Country policy \u2022 Finish the WALL \u2022 Deport people who don\u2019t qualify for asylum All Louisiana families want for Christmas this year is back from the Biden admin. It\u2019s like Pres. Biden\u2019s team has put together their Middle East policy with vodka and darts. My SALE Act will provide crucial broadband access by giving the FCC the authority to finish transferring spectrum. Pres. Biden signed my bill into law so now more Americans will have the tools they need to do their jobs and grow their businesses. With milk prices up because of #Bidenflation, Santa Claus might just have to settle for a glass of water with his cookies this Christmas Eve. AI is relatively new, so existing law isn\u2019t sufficient. AI will make our lives better if it doesn\u2019t kill us first, so our bill would start managing the AI threat by stopping people from using AI to commit financial fraud. The loon wing of the Dem Party owns Pres. Biden. That\u2019s why keeping the border wide open is more important to him than Israel or Ukraine funding. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t reach a deal on the bill before us. No one knows how to have more fun with the ones they love than the good people of Louisiana. Becky, Preston, and I want to wish you and your family peace and hope and joy during this Christmas season. Merry Christmas! Federal judges should know the difference between a law book and an L.L. Bean catalog. But Pres. Biden keeps nominating people who can\u2019t answer basic legal questions. AI is moving quickly, and our laws must prevent AI manipulation from rattling our financial markets. I\u2019m working with to help ensure that AI threats don't put Americans\u2019 investments and retirement dreams at risk. Chairman Martin Gruenberg led the FDIC while his agency apparently tolerated a culture of debauchery and sexual harassment. America is no country for creepy old men. Gruenberg should resign. As part of the National Defense Authorization Act, the Senate passed my bill to create a lead Inspector General so American taxpayer money being spent in Ukraine will not be wasted or stolen. Pres. Biden has tried to appease America\u2019s enemies. They no longer fear him, and therefore do not fear America. Even Democratic Governors now understand that Pres. Biden\u2019s open border policy isn\u2019t working. Stupid should hurt more. Some foreign shrimp being sold in our country have enough chemicals in them to make you grow an extra ear. My bill will increase inspections of foreign seafood. \"President Biden is in political trouble. His poll numbers are practically on the ocean floor. of the American people think his first car was a chariot. At times, his VP talks like she\u2019s from outer space.\u201d Allowing companies to run their own big full-service banks without effective oversight puts individual Americans and the U.S. financial system at risk. I\u2019m working to close the shadow banking loopholes that have left consumers vulnerable: Hurricanes Laura and Ida devastated so many parts of south Louisiana. I\u2019m thankful this will help cover some of the damage these storms did to Louisianians\u2019 utilities, hospitals, schools, and playgrounds. Big seafood exporters, like India and Ecuador, are flooding America\u2019s markets with illegal shrimp and selling it for cheaper than our quality Gulf shrimp. My bill would save jobs and protect Americans from unsafe food. Congress just passed my bill to counter China\u2019s communist antagonism by establishing a special envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum. Beijing pressures the Pacific Island states each day. It's time to put this strategic solution in place. Fixing the #BorderCrisis is as simple as returning to the policies that Pres. Trump had in place the day before Pres. Biden took office. Americans don\u2019t have the slightest idea who is coming across the southern border. Pres. Biden has left it wide open for more than MILLION people to come in illegally. The American people know things: Pres. Biden lied to them about his son\u2019s business and his involvement in it. Hunter Biden had to have lots of help. So what did Hunter do for the money, who helped him, and who did he share the money with? This year\u2019s NDAA includes big investments for Louisiana and America. The funding will give our service members a pay raise, strengthen border security and keep China, Russia and Iran in check. Louisianians are thankful for the 's years of service to America! The CFPB\u2019s woke small business rule could expose private personal information to the world. I\u2019m thankful to work with to stop the Biden admin from invading Americans\u2019 privacy and hurting job Main Street job creators. People from countries that hate America are coming into our country UNVETTED. The phrase \u2018from the river to the sea\u2019 is a call for genocide against Jewish people. It\u2019s a call to annihilate Israel. The only appropriate response to that threat is to condemn it. Jayden Daniels earned this Heisman Trophy with talent and grit. Louisianians will celebrate his legacy as a dual-threat quarterback for many years to come. Geaux Tigers! Pres. Biden and some of my Democrat colleagues are pretending they can talk about U.S. national security without addressing the border crisis. The president\u2019s open border is dangerous, and he has to do something to stop it. Countries that hate America know that Pres. Biden has left our border wide open. This October, border officials apprehended more than Chinese single adult men.\u201d My SALE Act gives Louisianians more access to broadband. I\u2019m thankful that the House has sent this bill to the president\u2019s desk so that the job providers who depend on wireless communications can continue to support rural economies. Louisianians in Calcasieu, Lafourche, and Terrebonne Parishes have been working hard to recover from Hurricanes Laura and Ida. I\u2019m grateful to see this help them Many hard-working employees across America won\u2019t get a bonus this Christmas season. Why? Bidenomics is CRUSHING small biz owners. Congrats to LSU\u2019s Jayden Daniels on the well-earned Heisman win! #GeauxTigers Ultimately, Hamas must be destroyed, and the Biden admin can\u2019t get weak-kneed about it. Kevin paid to buy milk, bread, toilet paper, laundry detergent, fabric softener, cling wrap, mac n cheese, a TV dinner, OJ & a bag of plastic army men when \u2018Home Alone\u2019 debuted. The same items now cost families thanks to #Bidenflation. Happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating across Louisiana, America, and the world! The average Louisiana family is losing every month to #Bidenflation. That can eat up a lot of their ability to put presents under the tree this Christmas. Some people in Washington seem confused as to why America backs Israel. In Louisiana, we understand that the debased people who slaughtered hundreds of young people at a peace concert are the bad guys. The Biden admin would rather debate whether men can breastfeed than protect America\u2019s interests against our enemies. I\u2019m grateful to see that this in Hurricane Ida aid will help southeast Louisianians rebuild in Gretna and Lafitte. The Biden White House has done very little to deter America\u2019s enemies throughout the world. years ago, the attack on #PearlHarbor claimed American lives. We will never forget the brave Americans lost that tragic day. There were more than migrant encounters at our southern border yesterday\u2014our highest single-day total ever. Pres. Biden and his party need to let us fix his broken, open border and stop the suffering that it\u2019s causing. The national debt is TRILLION. But Democrats seem content to ignore the crisis. The FBI got Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop on Dec. Social media companies took down the NY Post story when it published nearly a year later. Why didn\u2019t the FBI tell Americans then that the laptop was real? As Louisianians continue to recover from Hurricanes Laura and Ida, this will support that recovery in Orleans Parish, Lake Charles and at the Louisiana Children\u2019s Medical Center. The FBI attacked Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights by pressuring social media giants to censor users that the FBI didn\u2019t like. But the FBI won\u2019t take responsibility for its actions. Illegal immigration is destroying legal immigration. It\u2019s time to end the open, bleeding wound at the southern border. This will help Mt. Olive Baptist Church and Goodwill Church and their communities rebuild from Hurricanes Laura and Ida. The Biden admin shouldn\u2019t protect bureaucrats at the expense of vulnerable children who are in federal custody. The Biden broken border policies never stop. Fleet leveling would help preserve our fighter squadron at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in New Orleans. Pres. Biden\u2019s inflation is even hitting the partridge in its pear tree. According to the Christmas Price Index, the cost of the tree that the little bird calls home is up \u201creflecting overall growth in housing Pres. Biden\u2019s border is so open that \u201ccartels and people smugglers deliberately change tactics and send migrants to different areas to test for weaknesses\u201d\u2014and these lawbreakers find them way too often. So far, the U.S. is standing by Israel in its fight against Hamas, but some in Washington seem confused as to why we would do that. But Louisianians see through the hand-wringing of Israel\u2019s critics. The CFPB is putting small business owners at risk of having their private financial affairs exposed to the world. I hope Pres. Biden signs this legislation quickly to stop the bureau from enforcing its woke rule. The Biden admin\u2019s rule would make life more expensive for Americans and our auto industry more reliant on China. At a time of high inflation, no one should be forced to buy an electric vehicle. Grocery prices grew by in less than years. In the years before that, groceries didn\u2019t even go up The cost of barely getting by keeps getting higher under Bidenomics. Hurricanes Laura and Ida brought a great deal of destruction to our state and left debris in their paths. I\u2019m thankful that this will help Jefferson Davis Electric and Terrebonne Parish with recovery efforts. An gang member who has been living in America illegally just pleaded guilty to stabbing a man in Virginia. He had a \u201chistory of violence,\u201d but the Biden admin never deported him. For anyone wondering why what Judiciary Democrats did today is so dangerous, here's key context: Didn\u2019t get to vote \u201cno\u201d again today because Democrats shut down all speech on why this Biden nominee is so radical. Every day, scans thousands of Americans\u2019 faces without their permission and without making it clear that travelers can opt out. We have to protect Americans from Big Brother\u2019s attempts to get bigger. In less than months in Del Rio, border agents caught men who \u201chave all been convicted of a slew of sex crimes involving young children\u201d trying to sneak into our communities illegally. Why won't liberals help us protect kids by securing the border? Hurricane Laura\u2019s winds, rain, and flooding did severe damage to the arts and humanities building at SOWELA Technical Community College. This will help them continue to educate Louisianians. The Biden admin\u2019s open border policies can hit lower-income Americans the hardest. This Thanksgiving, Americans had to compete for a hot holiday meal with people who just crossed the southern border. Even the NY Times admits Biden voters are struggling under Biden's economy: \u201can accountant and single mother of four . . . feels the sting of inflation every time she goes to the grocery store \u2014 she spent on groceries this past month and didn\u2019t even fill her deep freezer\" American parents can go to the store and choose from breakfast cereals to feed their kids, but too many have no control over which school their children can attend. couple is working jobs but barely getting by. That\u2019s Bidenomics in action. Pres. Biden spent trillions of taxpayer dollars and caused an inflation disaster. Now, Louisiana families are on the hook for more each year than when he took office. How many of the illegal immigrants who crossed our border in weren't from Mexico? Sec. Mayorkas wouldn\u2019t answer. It\u2019s If we had effective Safe Third Country Agreements, millions of the people Pres. Biden allowed in would\u2019ve stopped before entering U.S. communities. Small businesses make up more than of Louisiana\u2019s businesses. They\u2019re the backbone of our economy. On we're grateful for our state\u2019s biggest job providers! Today, we give thanks for so many blessings\u2014our family, loved ones, and our state and country. God has truly blessed the United States and the people of Louisiana. No one is coming to save our schools in Louisiana but ourselves. If we want a prosperous future, we can\u2019t keep trapping students in classrooms where they can\u2019t learn. It\u2019s time for school choice in our state. In order to have peace in the Middle East, Hamas has got to be wiped out. Period. End of discussion. States that embraced school choice are climbing the ranks in student achievement. Louisiana should do the same. America can\u2019t be partners with Iran. We have to wipe Hamas off the face of the earth. The House passed a bill to support Israel by reducing the billions of dollars Pres. Biden gave the IRS. The Senate ought to pass it. The southern border is an open, bleeding wound. Since Pres. Biden took office, million people have poured across it . . . and we don\u2019t have the slightest idea who many of them are. If you allow Hamas terrorists to survive, they\u2019re going to attack Israel again. It\u2019s just that simple. Louisianians in Lake Charles and the rest of Calcasieu Parish are still working hard to recover from Hurricane Laura. I\u2019m glad this will help them continue to do just that. Too many of our schools have become failure factories\u2014where violence is common and learning is rare. Parents should be allowed to take their children out of failing schools and send them to schools that will help them thrive. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you that wage increases have made up for #Bidenflation. Real wages are down more than American workers have lost ground. The consolidated audit trail is as dangerous as it is un-American. The doesn\u2019t need to collect information on every single transaction an American investor makes. \u201cWhat is the difference between a stay order and an injunction?\u201d \u201cA stay order would prohibit . . . I\u2019m not sure that I actually can give you that.\u201d A federal judge has to grasp fundamental court orders. Why does the Biden admin keep trying to ram through nominees who don\u2019t? Hurricane Ida ripped through south Louisiana, leaving many buildings with significant damage. I\u2019m grateful that this will help repair New Orleans\u2019 NASA facility so that our scientists and rocket builders can continue their important work. Pres. Biden and his team decided early on that, if they were just nice to Iran, Iran would be nicer to us. As a result of that, Iran has been able to earn billions more from oil and got in money via the IMF. Sec. Yellen could have stopped that and didn\u2019t. Hurricanes Laura and Ida did a great deal of damage to so many buildings and facilities in Louisiana. I\u2019m grateful this will help Louisianians rebuild and repair. If ensuring that the has a professional work culture is\u2014as Chair Gruenberg claimed this week\u2014a \u201ctop priority for the FDIC,\u201d he should agree with my call for his resignation. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, just tell me.\u201d \u201cI certainly do know collateral estoppel. I\u2019m finding that the bright lights of the moment are making it hard for me to recall it.\u201d \u201cSo, you don\u2019t recall.\u201d Another day, another Biden nominee who doesn\u2019t know basic legal principles. For those who are tempted to forget or rewrite history in favor of the terrorists: On September Islamic extremists murdered people from countries. The attacks were evil then, and they\u2019re evil today. When Pres. Biden nominates activists to judgeships, my Democrat colleagues don\u2019t do anything about it. Any American with a retirement fund should be worried about \u2019s Consolidated Audit Trail. It\u2019s a ticking timebomb of sensitive personal information that hackers can\u2019t wait to detonate. South Louisiana is still recovering from Hurricanes Laura and Ida. I\u2019m thankful for this which will help cover repair costs at McNeese University and in Lafourche Parish. A great victory for religious freedom\u2014Finnish court unanimously upheld the acquittal of P\u00e4ivi R\u00e4s\u00e4nen & Juhana Pohjola. I\u2019ve urged our State Dept to defend religious liberty against overzealous prosecutors and welcome this decision to protect free speech. Part of the reason the world is on fire in the Middle East and elsewhere is the Biden admin\u2019s weakness and naivete. The cost of insulin is rising for too many diabetic Louisianians. This bipartisan report shows why Congress needs to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act. We can improve lives and save money. We\u2019re not going to have peace in the Middle East until Hamas is obliterated. There's no middle ground on this issue. Louisiana Tech student Colin Campbell\u2019s courageous actions may have helped save lives amid the horrific stabbing yesterday. I\u2019m so grateful Colin was there to help. Becky and I are praying for all those injured and affected by this violence. #Bidenflation is costing families in Louisiana an extra a year. Good people shouldn\u2019t be expected to max out their credit cards or borrow from their kids\u2019 college education plan to get by. Hamas has murdered more than Americans and is holding others captive. What\u2019s it going to take for the Biden admin to push the UN to sanction Hamas? Many European countries have Safe Third Country policies. It\u2019s a smart move. Pres. Biden and Sec. Mayorkas haven\u2019t pursued effective Safe Third Country Agreements re the southern border, and unvetted people are flooding into America. Hurricane Laura struck south Louisiana hard and left buildings with water damage. I\u2019m glad to see that this will help Lake Charles Memorial Hospital address mold from the On #VeteransDay, we honor the service of the millions of patriotic men and women who have protected the United States. We are beyond thankful for all they have done for our country. Inflation is gutting people. The southern border is an open wound. The rest of the world is on fire because Pres. Biden thinks he can achieve peace through weakness. And what do Congressional Democrats do? They attack SCOTUS\u2014a separate branch of govt. Since the U.S. Marine Corps has honorably served America. Louisianians are thankful to the U.S. Marines for their commitment to our nation. Hamas burned babies alive while yelling for joy. Spare me the retort that \u201cHamas is oppressed.\u201d Democrats started threatening to tear down SCOTUS\u2014and then Justice Kavanaugh became the target of an assassin. Have Pres. Biden and Sec. Mayorkas vetted all of the MILLION people who have crossed our southern border under their watch? Doesn\u2019t sound like it . . . How many folks have come into America illegally under Pres. Biden\u2019s watch? Are most of them from Mexico or not? What countries are they coming from? How many are seeking asylum? The Biden admin can\u2019t tell you. If folks would read a book, they\u2019d learn that many Israelis are refugees or descended from refugees. There\u2019s no cause in the world that can justify what Hamas did. These are evil people. Senior Master Sgt. John McNeece has an amazing dedication to preserving the legacy of the iconic bomber at Barksdale Air Force Base. Louisiana is proud of our generations of servicemembers! We're learning quickly that a lot of college students believe in diversity, equity, exclusion, and the right to kill Jews. The fellas see the baseless attacks Democrats are launching at SCOTUS. Many liberals think SCOTUS should be able to rewrite the Constitution to achieve radical policy goals that voters have rejected. And when they fail, they sling mud. If you want to strangle Iran, you cut off their oil. The Biden admin is choosing not to do that, and now they wonder why Iran\u2019s proxies thought they could get away with attacking Israel and, by extension, America. So many communities in south Louisiana were left devastated by Hurricanes Laura, Zeta and Ida. I\u2019m grateful to see this help their recovery. Sec. Blinken should quickly seek comprehensive UN sanctions against Iran\u2019s ballistic missile and drone programs. I\u2019m proud to sponsor the VA Home Loan Awareness Act to help make the American dream a reality for those who courageously serve our country. Forcing the Biden DHS to issue a detailed report on the hundreds of thousands of immigrants it releases into the U.S. would give the American people the truth about how the admin is fueling lawlessness at the border and around the country. With the cash it\u2019s making from oil sales, Iran is fanning the flames of global instability by enriching uranium and sponsoring terror. I\u2019m proud to support the SHIP Act to hold ports and refineries that Tehran does business with accountable. Here are the facts: Pres. Trump put tough sanctions on Iran, but Pres. Biden hasn\u2019t really enforced them. When Judge Kasubhai tells people who appear before his court to announce their pronouns, that isn\u2019t \u201cvoluntary.\u201d It\u2019s oppressive. Pres. Biden wants him on the federal bench. If I could vote \u201cno\u201d twice, I would. The fundamental issue that some Democrats have with SCOTUS is that they don\u2019t like some of the Court\u2019s opinions. I\u2019ve disagreed with many SCOTUS opinions myself. But I haven\u2019t tried to destroy the Court. The Houthis are a terrorist organization. The Biden admin needs to act like it. The White House must stand firm against Iran\u2019s proxy army by imposing sanctions and preventing the Houthis from launching further attacks on Israel. Pres. Biden doesn\u2019t have a plan to fix inflation because that would require him to spend less taxpayer money. Pres. Biden\u2019s economy gets a \u201cD.\u201d People in Louisiana have to sell blood plasma to afford a trip to the grocery store. Of course banks and lenders should be able to consider immigration status before issuing loans. Ignoring that factor could hurt the banking sector and larger U.S. economy. The and Biden admin are throwing common sense out the window. Parts of the world are on fire. Why is that? In part, it\u2019s because Pres. Biden has sent every message of weakness possible to Iran, China, and Russia. Hurricane Ida left a great deal of damage behind when it hit Terrebonne Parish. I\u2019m grateful to see this help these Louisianians as they rebuild for the future. Officials caught people on the FBI\u2019s terror watch list trying to cross the southern border last month alone. Border security is national security. Pres. Biden has made the mistake of approving BILLION in IMF allocations for Iran, China, and Russia once. Congress can't stand by and let him bankroll terrorists and genocidal regimes again. The latest in : #Bidenflation is drowning out the American Dream. Housing alone is costing Louisiana families an extra each month. Border Patrol caught a record migrants illegally crossing our southern border in September. The majority of them were single adults. There\u2019s a reason most Americans don\u2019t think Pres. Biden has this crisis under control. Hurricane Ida caused bad damage to Lafourche, Terrebonne and St. Helena Parishes, as well as to New Orleans. I\u2019m thankful to see that this will support Louisianians\u2019 recovery efforts. Louisianians can't afford to wait for FEMA payments before beginning the disaster recovery process. The Emergency Advance Payments Modernization Act ensures FEMA has tools it needs to rapidly issue advance payments for flood insurance claims: Louisianians know the damage that flooding causes all too well. I\u2019m grateful that this will help support upgrades to the Ascension Parish pump stations and levee system. Seems like the people with the most radical climate agendas are the ones who can\u2019t give me straight answers on how much it will actually cost to go carbon neutral. No fair-minded policymaker wants to embark on something that even these \u201cexperts\u201d can\u2019t explain or guarantee. Pres. Biden just kept giving Tehran money. And in the last few weeks, Iran has attacked U.S. assets repeatedly. More members of the FBI terror watchlist are sneaking into our country than ever before. Congress needs transparency from so we can address the threats that open borders pose to American communities. Happy to fight to prevent government workers from unduly stripping veterans of their right to bear arms. Since Pres. Biden took office, how many people have come into our country illegally or on the basis of an asylum claim? Biden officials had no answer for me today. It\u2019s MILLION. That\u2019s Nebraskas. Congratulations to my good friend @RepMikeJohnson on becoming Speaker. The House has selected an outstanding leader to navigate an unprecedented time. Mike isn\u2019t just a consistent a courageous one. My full statement: Louisiana families\u2019 monthly energy bills are up thanks to #Bidenflation and the president\u2019s war on American energy. This is and it puts about MILLION Americans at risk. Collecting and storing your personal data in the CAT has no regulatory purpose. I wrote a bill to stop from putting investors\u2019 personal info into Big Brother\u2019s database. It\u2019s official: the broke yet another record. Border crossings in fiscal year hit an all-time high\u2014over million. For everyone keeping track, that\u2019s now million people illegally crossing our borders under Pres. Biden\u2019s watch. AI is moving quickly, and so are the scammers who are using it to exploit unsuspecting Americans. Our bill would tell consumers whether what they\u2019re reading, seeing or hearing is the product of AI, and that\u2019s clarity that people desperately need. Hurricane Laura dealt southwest Louisiana a tough blow, but its people are as strong as ever. I\u2019m glad to see this help Cameron Parish prepare for future storms by elevating at-risk structures. We\u2019re praying for everyone suffering in the wake of the tragedies. If you\u2019re looking for a way to help, many local blood donation centers are in This administration is gutting Louisianians like a fish. Louisiana families are now losing out on every month because of #Bidenflation. In addition to the the Biden admin released to Iran, the president gave Iran through the IMF. I introduced the No Dollars for Dictators Act to make sure Pres. Biden can\u2019t do it again. What do America\u2019s enemies see? Pres. Biden cut and ran in Afghanistan. He\u2019s been reluctant to give Ukraine the weapons it needs to win. His admin hasn\u2019t really been enforcing sanctions against Iran. The Biden admin's woke proposal to block the sale of gas-powered cars benefits Chinese manufacturing. I\u2019m proud to support the CARS Act to stop the EPA from making the American dream more expensive for millions of hardworking people in our country. The adults behind Louisiana\u2019s new graduation requirement plan aren\u2019t putting kids first. Every kid in Louisiana can learn. Sometimes they need a little bit longer, but it's not going to do the next generation any good to give them a diploma that they can\u2019t even read. Jack Lew was an architect of Pres. Obama\u2019s Iran Deal, which allowed the regime to do the damage it\u2019s doing today. We don\u2019t need an ambassador who believes in appeasement. Confucius Institutes promote Chinese Communist propaganda and suppress students\u2019 academic liberty. The CONFUCIUS Act would give universities control over these organizations, so that campuses can safeguard our First Amendment rights. I\u2019m not opposed to humanitarian aid. I\u2019m opposed to humanitarian aid that ends up in Hamas\u2019s hands, which is used to kill more innocent people. Hurricane Ida wreaked havoc throughout our state. This will help defray recovery costs for our Children\u2019s Medical Center and St. Charles community. Pres. Biden's CFPB wants to collect data on small biz owners' race, ethnicity, and sex when they apply for a loan. I'm grateful the Senate passed my resolution to block this woke attempt to burden small businesses even more than inflation already has: I\u2019m glad to work with on a bipartisan bill to protect the welfare of our four legged friends. The Better Care for Animals Act gives the DOJ more tools to rescue these creatures from abuse\u2014there\u2019s no reason my colleagues can\u2019t pass it. America\u2019s enemies have concluded that we have a president who is weak on national defense. And peace through weakness never works. The Biden admin green-lit a deal that sent BILLION to Iran and another BILLION to China and Russia. Congress can\u2019t afford to let this White House do it again. After the Biden admin made shameful negotiations to transfer to Tehran, Iran sponsored a devastating terror attack on Israel, killing and taking Americans hostage. Allowing the transfer to go through would enable and embolden Iran\u2019s proxy armies. Pres. Biden\u2019s #OpenBorder is encouraging people from regimes that hate America to sneak into our individuals on the terror watchlist. Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana\u2019s hospitals hard, and I\u2019m thankful to see this help southwest health care facilities recover from the damage. On day one in the White House, the Biden admin declared war on American energy. That means Americans pay higher prices and our country has to depend on foreign nations for oil. Congratulations to Louisiana Governor-Elect Jeff Landry. Louisiana\u2019s future CAN be better than our present and our past, and I look forward to working with our new governor to make that happen. The Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel are despicable and depraved. As we mourn the hundreds of lives lost, including at least U.S. citizens, we must also remain vigilant in our efforts to safeguard our communities at home. Our statement here: #Bidenflation is basically just a tax at the grocery store. The United States Navy has served our country honorably for years. Today and every day, we thank the men and women of the Navy for their dedication and service to America. Even if #Bidenflation fell to zero tomorrow, prices would still be higher than when Pres. Biden took office. Radical liberal policies have already coddled violent criminals in our communities. And now Pres. Biden\u2019s open border is letting gangs from across the border victimize Americans, too. Hurricane Laura hit Louisianians in Alexandria hard, with a lot of damage being done to their electrical power system. I\u2019m grateful to see this million help cover these necessary repairs. American taxpayers are paying for Pres. Biden\u2019s weak border policies. Louisianians alone will foot an estimated MILLION in costs from illegal immigration. When Pres. Biden took office, gas cost Louisianians an average of per gallon. Today, it\u2019s up more than across our state thanks to #Bidenomics. The terrorism Hamas has launched against Israel and its civilians cannot go unanswered. Iran directs and finances Hamas, and both are clearly emboldened. This cannot be tolerated. Israel has the right to defend itself fully from these attacks, and America must stand with them. Hurricane Ida struck a blow to Louisiana, leaving debris throughout our state. I\u2019m grateful to see that this will help dredging efforts in Lafourche. At just years old, Arianna Prince is a hero. Her family and the Winnsboro community should be very proud. Hurricanes Laura, Delta, and Ida hit Louisiana hard, and many of our people are still dealing with their disastrous impacts. This will help Louisianians as they recover and leave us better prepared for future storms. The SEC is warehousing more than Americans\u2019 private information with its Consolidated Audit Trail, and it\u2019s a national security threat. My letter with : I\u2019m grateful to see this help Louisianians in Calcasieu Parish and all over our state recover from flooding and prepare for future disasters. Pres. Biden removed the smart border policies he inherited, and the illegal immigrants started flooding in. America\u2019s political leadership has got to stop demonizing cops. Costs are not coming down. American families are stuck with Pres. Biden\u2019s high prices\u2014even if inflation goes to zero tomorrow. Inflation in America is man-made, and that man\u2019s name is Pres. Joe Biden. Bidenflation is robbing Louisiana families of a year. That\u2019s almost that they could be putting towards their mortgage, car payment, or retirement savings. Anyone with ties to the Iranian regime should not have a security clearance at the Department of Defense\u2014that\u2019s common sense. Our letter to Sec. Austin here: Protecting Americans and half-a-million Louisianians from a lapse in flood insurance is an overwhelmingly bipartisan in the midst of hurricane season. It\u2019s reckless to block this simple solution the day before coverage could lapse. Louisiana is proud of our LA National Guard soldiers for an exceptional job in the military intelligence contest! Sen. Feinstein cared about her country and her state. We didn\u2019t agree politically, but she was a delight to serve with. I so valued our friendship and am praying for all of her loved ones. It\u2019s regrettable and dangerous that my bill to extend Louisianians\u2019 flood coverage was blocked today. million Americans and almost Louisianians rely on the National Flood Insurance Program to protect their homes and businesses. The Biden WH claims it\u2019s doing \u201ceverything it can\u201d to address its that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s time to designate cartels as foreign terrorist organizations so the U.S. can better fight the crime and suffering coming through our border. Bidenflation is costing Louisiana families more each month\u2014that\u2019s almost a year. Is your income rising enough to keep up with that? Cartels are encouraging swaths of immigrants to overwhelm CBP agents so that the gangs can traffic fentanyl and humans into America. And Pres. Biden\u2019s #BorderCrisis is making the cartels\u2019 job easier: The CFPB\u2019s funding scheme reveals much about what\u2019s wrong with big government. Our bill would do away with the CFPB\u2019s unfair pay advantage and begin to put the agency\u2019s staff on equal footing with other hardworking federal employees. Since the president took office, Louisiana families are losing a month to inflation. How many tanks of gas, electricity bills, or grocery store runs does that represent for your family? Louisianians fall down times and get up when floods come on the heels of hurricanes. I saw that firsthand today when I caught up with heroes like Ms. Geraldine in Carencro. The Biden admin is again weaponizing the tax code against American energy producers. The president\u2019s plan would raise energy prices for Louisiana families even higher. No matter what the Obama judge says, illegal immigrants don\u2019t have the right to own a firearm. Foreign nationals who are in our country illegally are not Americans. Duh. The Senate just unanimously passed my common-sense solution to help the private sector & federal officials work together to better respond to hurricanes and other emergencies. I\u2019ll keep working to get Louisianians the help they need when disaster strikes. Democrats want to spend TRILLION to become carbon neutral & held a hearing to tell us why. Dem witness: Carbon dioxide is \"a huge part of our atmosphere.\" Me: \"It\u2019s actually a very small part of our atmosphere.\" Dem witness: \"Well, okay. But, yeah. I don\u2019t know.\" Many Louisianians are still recovering from Hurricane Ida\u2019s damage. This will help repair electric lines in south Louisiana and support Lafourche Parish Hospital\u2019s continued recovery. Biden judge: \u201cAssault weapons may be banned because they're extraordinary dangers and are not appropriate for legitimate self-defense purposes.\u201d The same Biden judge: \u201cI am not a gun expert.\u201d Razor wire won't hurt you unless you try to go over it or through it. So I've never understood politically why Pres. Biden wants to oppose barriers at the southern border\u2014other than the fact that he really does believe in open borders. Some of my Democratic colleagues call folks who are in our country illegally \u201cundocumented Americans.\u201d They're not undocumented Americans. They're foreign nationals, and they're in our country illegally. Louisiana\u2019s small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and they deserve a fair shot at working with the federal government. Here\u2019s one thing I\u2019m doing to make that happen: Real wages just can\u2019t keep up with #Bidenflation. So, hardworking Louisianians feel like they\u2019re running a race they can\u2019t win. It\u2019s impossible to fully undo the effects of cross-sex hormones or heal the scars of mastectomies or genital surgeries. So why do some activists insist that parents rush kids into sex-change surgeries and inject them with sterilizing drugs? Sometimes I think that the Biden White House would lower the average IQ of an entire city. You can't borrow and spend the kind of money that Pres. Biden has without causing inflation. This is basic ECON Why are energy costs up almost under Pres. Biden? He\u2019s spent years bowing to neo-socialists who think America has no right to be energy independent. Pres. Biden and Sec. Mayorkas may want to let dangerous lawbreakers come roam America illegally, but Congress doesn't. The Laken Riley Act would get criminal aliens out of our country before they victimize more Americans. Hurricane Ida left many in southeast Louisiana without a safe place to work. I\u2019m grateful this will help cover the costs of temporary offices in Houma. When waterways overflow, Louisianians\u2019 homes and businesses are at risk of serious damage. I\u2019m grateful to see that this will reduce the risk of flooding in Concordia Parish. The Biden admin wants to limit Americans\u2019 freedom to get affordable, short-term health insurance plans that fit their needs. My Patients Choice Act would make sure bureaucrats can\u2019t force Louisianians to pay more for insurance through Obamacare. Louisiana families don\u2019t have an extra to burn every month. But that\u2019s what #Bidenflation now costs them. The United Kingdom, Sweden, Luxembourg, Finland, Denmark, and Belgium have all prohibited sex reassignment surgeries for children. Other countries are proving themselves wiser than America. Unelected bureaucrats shouldn\u2019t be able to strip veterans of their Second Amendment rights unilaterally. Because my legislation is now law, veterans will get the due process they deserve to protect their freedom. The majority of Americans support building the WALL. Meanwhile, the Biden admin remains addicted to its open border.", "More than Washingtonians are living with Alzheimer's disease. It was good to meet with WA advocates from to discuss funding for research into new treatments, and how we can do more to support our state's dementia patients and their caregivers. Thank you to the WA dentists and dental students from the who visited me to talk about ways to support dentists and make dental care more affordable for Washingtonians. Congress is delivering million in critical funding to make health care more accessible \u2013 especially for our rural communities. People from Mill Creek, Lynnwood, and Edmonds are now able to get this reliable service, leaving every minutes on weekdays. And that is the reliable service they deserve. Over the last two decades, this agreement has fostered so much progress along more than miles of the Columbia River. It's enabled a bypass, and helped protect juvenile salmon and steelhead, bolstered the hatchery programs with more sustainable fish production, and showed real progress on habitat restoration in the mid-Columbia. Happy Easter! Wishing all who celebrate a happy and joyful day! Congrats to the for another historic hoops accomplishment. And good luck to and today as you play to reach the Elite Eight! Yesterday I was in Bellingham to celebrate the opening of the Laurel Forest Apartments, a affordable housing project made possible by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. Getting this done at a federal level \u2013 building many more projects like Laurel Forest -- has to be our nation's priority. We're in a big fight right now in the United States Senate on legislation that I've sponsored to increase that tax credit and provide more units nationwide, more units in the State of Washington over the next two years. As cherry growers prepare to kick off their new season, this disaster designation will help them access federal assistance to keep this billion industry going \u2013 and ensure Washington's famously delicious sweet cherries make it into shopping carts. Mifepristone is a safe and effective abortion medication that has been used by over five million people since the FDA approved it over two decades ago. Abortion opponents won't win in the court of public opinion, so they decided to file this lawsuit threatening patient access to mifepristone and challenging the FDA\u2019s scientific process instead. I want to ensure everyone knows that mifepristone is legal and accessible in the State of Washington right now \u2013 but the Supreme Court\u2019s eventual ruling in this case could affect mifepristone access nationwide. My prayers are with all those affected by the bridge collapse. Thank you to the Coast Guard and the brave first responders who continue to tirelessly work on rescue efforts and I will continue to monitor the situation closely. The Affordable Care Act was signed into law years ago today. Thanks to the #ACA, millions of Americans have better access to affordable health care through Medicaid expansion and protections for people with pre-existing conditions. I will continue working to drive down health care costs and to ensure that all Americans have access to high-quality health care. On the anniversary of the Oso landslide, we honor the people whose lives were suddenly and tragically cut short years ago today. We also renew our gratitude to the first responders -- those who searched for and comforted survivors, and those who restored services to areas cut off by the landslide. Being there in the aftermath with the community is something I will never forget. This is a disaster we never want to see repeated, which is why I worked with Rep. DelBene to pass a law that improves our ability to recognize and prepare for catastrophic landslide risks, and am now working with Senator Murkowski to renew and expand that program. Today #MarchMadness gets into full swing and WA has four amazing teams in the tourneys! Congrats and good luck to , , , and . This funding will support the Lummi Nation's restoration of the South Fork Nooksack River Watershed, the Makah Tribe's new wastewater infrastructure to keep their community and environment safe, and the Hoh Tribe's efforts to move residents and Tribal facilities to higher ground. Today\u2019s announcement is a huge investment in the future and growth potential of the Pacific Northwest\u2019s Silicon Forest, including supporting jobs and innovation in Southwest Washington. Leveraging private sector investments to boost and secure our domestic chip supply chain are exactly the kind of investments the CHIPS and Science Act was designed to spur in order to secure America\u2019s national security and economic prosperity. I enjoyed meeting with #RegeneronSTS science competition finalist Saraswathy Amjith, a senior at Redmond's Tesla STEM High. Saraswathy developed a new tool to identify illegal logging by using machine learning to help analyze satellite and radar imagery. It's so important right now to get more young people into the sciences. That\u2019s why I advocated for increased STEM funding in the CHIPS & Science Act. Investments in smart infrastructure are a win for public safety. The Yakama Nation\u2019s new alert system along will improve safety on one of the state\u2019s most dangerous highways. What a perfect day to welcome professional soccer to Spokane! I was thrilled to join & a sold out crowd for FC\u2019s first-ever home match. Happy #PiDay! Today we celebrate our STEM educators, students, and workers. WA has the concentration of STEM jobs in the U.S. \u2013 our workers are essential to maintaining our nation\u2019s R&D leadership. Today is #EqualPayDay, a reminder that even in women working full-time are still only paid cents for every dollar paid to a man. Every American deserves equal pay for equal work. It\u2019s past time Congress passed the Paycheck Fairness Act to end gender pay discrimination. Ramadan Mubarak to all those in our Muslim community in the State of Washington and around the world who are fasting during the holy month. I wish you all joy and peace in the coming year! #RamadanKareem Today on Billy Frank Jr. Day, we celebrate the life and legacy of this legendary civil rights leader and his fight for Treaty fishing rights and salmon restoration. I am looking forward to when we will welcome a statue of Billy Frank Jr. to the National Statuary Hall in our nation\u2019s Capitol. When so many in our country are fighting for equity and social justice, it is fitting that we share his story with the entire nation. I am honored to have been named a Humane Society Champion, an award for members of Congress who scored a on the annual legislative scorecard. Happy International Women\u2019s Day! It is more important than ever to honor all of the courageous women who have fought for equal opportunity and gender equality worldwide. While we still have much work to do, today is a day to celebrate how far we\u2019ve come. President Biden made clear tonight how to keep investing in America's future -- building on the success of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS & Science, and the Inflation Reduction Act. He wants to further reduce drug costs, invest in more affordable housing, and train and skill more people for the good paying American jobs that have been created. Spokane is growing, and that puts more pressure on the need for affordable housing. So we have to be very vigilant about building more supply. I was proud to author legislation to establish this program. The whale desk will operate hours a day, seven days a week and will serve as a vital tool for protecting whale populations in Puget Sound. Today is the start of -- a time to applaud the trailblazers who opened doors ahead of us. Our country is stronger and more successful when women are included in every board room, every ballot box, and every discussion in our communities. Last year there were more than robbery attempts at marijuana dispensaries in the State of Washington. This bill will take the target off the backs of our state\u2019s dispensaries by updating federal banking laws so they don\u2019t have to do all their business in cash. The shocking Alabama IVF ruling revealed the next front of the anti-choice crusade, attacking all forms of reproductive health care, not just abortion. Today, our Republican colleagues chose to block legislation that would allow millions of Americans to continue to use IVF to help expand their families. These personal medical decisions belong to families, not the government. I was proud to co-sponsor this year\u2019s Senate resolution designating February \u2013 March as Public Schools Week. Thank you to all the teachers in Washington state and around the country who work tirelessly to teach and inspire the next generation. Congress commissioned the Expert Panel\u2019s report as part of the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act to hold Boeing accountable for improving the safety culture of its Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) unit. The report makes clear that Boeing's safety culture and SMS need to improve, and FAA should hold them accountable in doing so. The FAA and manufacturers should listen to both Machinists and SPEEA who are asking for a stronger safety culture to improve certification and production quality. It\u2019s urgent the U.S. deliver the support for Ukraine to keep fighting Russia\u2019s unprovoked war. It is critical to preserving democracies in the region and protecting America\u2019s immediate and long-term national security. I stand with and my other Senate colleagues currently in Ukraine in proclaiming the U.S. won\u2019t abandon its ally and that the House must immediately take up the bipartisan Senate-approved funding package. The package will deliver vital support to our democratic allies Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, as well as desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza and Ukraine.

While the approval of this declaration is key to helping these communities heal, this is another stark reminder of how slow federal assistance can be to arrive in the aftermath of a disaster. I will continue working with my colleagues on legislative changes to speed disaster recovery aid delivery to rural communities. LIVE: Sen. Cantwell joins WA apple growers and India Consul General to celebrate huge apple export Today is the for Japanese internment.

It is up to the House to pass this Senate-approved funding package that delivers vital support to our democratic allies Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan, as well as desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza and Ukraine. This funding is critical to America\u2019s immediate and long-term national security. I continue to support President Biden\u2019s vigorous efforts to facilitate the return of Israeli hostages and avoid a wider regional war. The international community should do everything it can to protect and get aid to innocent Palestinian civilians.

Trump is the reason women across our nation are suffering. The Arizona Supreme Court ruled an extreme abortion ban from the with no exceptions for health, rape, or incest will go into effect. Trump is responsible for this. I\u2019m in Tucson to discuss the fight ahead for our reproductive freedom. Tune in. In I called on states to expand Medicaid postpartum coverage to months. States across the country have answered the call. states now have months of postpartum coverage\u2014and I look forward to the day when it is as we improve maternal health across America. I\u2019m headed to Arizona, where the state Supreme Court ruled that an abortion ban from with no exceptions for health, rape, or incest will go into effect. The fight for reproductive freedom continues. Women across our country are suffering at the hands of extremists who say they\u2019re motivated by the well-being of women and children but ignore the crisis of maternal mortality. Black women are times as likely to die because of complications than their white counterparts. As we begin Black Maternal Health Week, we must ensure Black women get the care they deserve throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. Elections matter. Organizing matters. Showing up matters. The strength and power of our voice matter. Together, we will fight for the freedoms, liberty, rights, and dignity of all people. Since taking office, and I have made the largest investment ever to tackle the climate crisis. Over the next years, a trillion dollars will be invested in creating jobs, clean energy, and small businesses as we build a clean energy economy.

More than in women of reproductive age live in a state with an abortion ban. If Trump has his way, he'll gut abortion care in every state across the country\u2014and he has plans to do it. and I will do everything in our power to restore women's reproductive freedom. Arizona just rolled back the clock to a time before women were even allowed the right to vote. There's only one person responsible: Donald Trump. President and I will do everything in our power to stop him and restore women's reproductive freedom. If Trump has the opportunity to sign a national abortion ban, he will. If Congress passes a law restoring the reproductive freedoms of Roe, will sign it. The contrast could not be clearer. There is an extreme abortion ban in every state in the South, except for Virginia. I spoke with a medical school student in North Carolina, Antoinette, who shared her experience living in a state where women have been robbed of their reproductive freedom. Donald Trump declares again he's proud of his role in overturning Roe. He is the architect of this health care crisis and because of him, in women today live in states with bans. Black women are as likely to die from complications. Native women are as likely to die. Women in rural America are more likely to die. We are determined to ensure women get the care they deserve throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. Apprenticeship programs are pathways to good-paying union jobs. President Biden and I are taking action to expand apprenticeship opportunities because when we invest in the American worker, everyone benefits. In people voted in record numbers.

President would veto any attempt by the United States Congress to pass a national abortion ban. To truly protect reproductive freedoms, we must restore the protections of Roe. When Congress passes a bill that reinstates those protections, President Biden will sign it into law. If reelected, Trump has openly said he intends to weaponize the Department of Justice against his enemies. He openly talks about his admiration for dictators and has vowed to be a dictator on day one. It\u2019s on us to recognize the threat he poses\u2014the choice is clear in\u2026 Congress must pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an assault weapons ban.

On Easter Sunday, we are celebrating hope and faith in renewal. Wishing everyone a happy Easter. Tomorrow marks the last day of Women\u2019s History Month. President Biden and I will continue fighting every day to build a country where every woman and girl has the opportunity to thrive. Donald Trump has made clear his fight is not for the people. He fights for himself. President and I are guided by a fundamental belief: We work for you, the American people. In America, in women of reproductive age live in a state with an abortion ban in effect. This is a direct result of Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. He is the architect of this health care crisis. Millions of women want to start a small business but don\u2019t have access to the capital that allows them to do that. and I have now invested billions of dollars to expand access to capital for women entrepreneurs and lift up the economic status of women. President and I have forgiven nearly billion of student loan debt for over million people, including teachers, firefighters, and public servants, erasing their debt completely. Red flag laws can help save lives from gun violence before tragedy occurs. states have passed red flag laws. I challenge the remaining states: Come on over. Donald Trump is proud that women across our nation have been robbed of their fundamental freedoms. Since Roe was overturned, I have met with women who were refused care during a miscarriage. One woman was turned away repeatedly in the emergency room because the doctors were afraid they might be thrown in jail for helping her\u2014it was only when she developed sepsis that she\u2026 Tonight, , , and are hosting a historic grassroots fundraiser in New York City.

Historic investment in youth mental health. Strengthened the Affordable Care Act. Over the past three years, and I have made health care more accessible and affordable for Americans. The contrast is clear. President and I expanded access to affordable health care. Trump and extremists around the country are trying to take away health care coverage. ., , and are hosting a grassroots fundraiser to talk about the stakes of this election. Chip in now to reserve your spot: Once Congress passes a bill that restores the protections of Roe, President will sign it into law. The choice in November is clear: we must elect to strengthen and expand Social Security so our seniors can retire with dignity. Trump engineered the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Since that time, extremists in states across our nation have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and punish women. We must do everything we can to fight for reproductive rights. When we took office, I called on states to expand Medicaid postpartum coverage to months. states have answered the call. Donald Trump wants to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act. If he's successful, over million people will lose their health coverage. Protecting access to health care is on the ballot in November. Everyone should be able to access the health care they need regardless of who they are, where they live, or how much they earn. That is why we will continue using every tool to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. During his first term in office, Donald Trump was one vote away from repealing the Affordable Care Act. Now, he\u2019s promising to try to repeal it again and gut health care for the millions of Americans who rely on it. President and I will not let that happen. On March the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. Since then, it has been the most consequential health care legislation passed in generations in our country, delivering high-quality, affordable health care to million Americans. Donald Trump is committed to repealing the Affordable Care Act and ripping away protections for millions of people with preexisting conditions.

Nearly million jobs created since President and I took office. President Biden and I stand with the majority of Americans who believe women should have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and lives. We remain committed to defending access to reproductive health care, including medication abortion. Donald Trump openly talks about how he is proud that he overturned Roe v. Wade.

It was a pleasure to visit , where Latina small business owners like Juanny power our communities with their dreams and ambitions. We will continue to fight for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws. States across our nation have been passing anti-voter laws. These laws have cut back early voting, limited polling locations, and made it harder for people to vote. We\u2019re pushing against extremists\u2019 attacks and working to ensure all Americans can exercise their right to vote. In voters said we must do more to help folks struggling with student loan debt. President and I canceled nearly billion in student loan debt for almost million Americans, an average of more than per person. I know I won\u2019t be the last. Let us keep the gate open and make it bigger and wider for all who follow. Donald Trump hand-picked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe v. Wade. states have extended Medicaid postpartum coverage from months to I challenge the remaining states to answer my call.

The Arizona Supreme Court ruling allows an abortion ban to go into effect. There are no exceptions for rape and incest, and it threatens doctors and nurses with prison time. It does not have to be this way. Congress must restore the protections of Roe. Happening Now: I am back in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for a roundtable discussion about our continued work to cancel student debt for millions of Americans. President Biden and I have forgiven nearly in student debt for almost people. We also created the SAVE Plan to cut monthly student loan payments in half. On SAVE Day of Action, I am urging people across the nation to apply today: While in Minnesota earlier this month, I stopped by Saint Paul Central High School to say hello to their softball teams. When I see these girls' leadership, heart, and competitive spirit \u2014 I know the future of our nation is bright. While in the Twin Cities yesterday, I thanked health care professionals who are on the frontlines of our fight for reproductive freedom. They dedicate themselves to providing care for the women of Minnesota, as well as those from states with extreme abortion bans. I am back in Minnesota today for the sixth stop on my nationwide Fight For Reproductive Freedoms Tour. and I will never stop fighting to protect a woman\u2019s ability to make decisions about her own body. We trust women, and women trust us to fight for reproductive freedom. As the head of the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, I am proud to announce that all gun dealers must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell. This will save lives and keep our communities safe. I am wishing a very happy birthday to my dear friend, Dolores Huerta. Women, workers, and immigrants across our nation are better off because of your leadership and organizing. May your day be filled with joy and celebration. Undefeated. Undisputed. Congratulations to Coach Dawn Staley and the entire team on your National Championship. I can\u2019t wait to see you again \u2014 this time, celebrating at the White House. In the Grier Heights neighborhood of Charlotte, homes like Levon's were built with windows, good insulation, and electric appliances. Our historic investments will help families across our nation upgrade their homes and lower their energy bills. This Alabama hospital ending its IVF services is another devastating example of what happens when extremists attack reproductive freedom and criminalize providers. Overturning Roe has triggered a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect. Women in America die in connection with childbirth at a higher rate than women in any other wealthy nation in the world. President Biden and I are fighting to make sure women get the health care they need. We didn't let a little rain get in the way of a fun-filled day at the White House Easter Egg Roll! Beyonc\u00e9: Thank you for reminding us to never feel confined to other people's perspective of what our lane is. You have redefined a genre and reclaimed country music\u2019s Black roots.

To , and all the leaders who joined me: Thank you for the work you do every day to lift up women and girls across our nation and around the world.

Happy Holi to the South Asian community and all who celebrate. To the families of Parkland: nobody should have to endure what you have experienced. Our nation has a duty to remember this tragedy, bear witness to the pain each of you carry, and honor the memory of your loved ones with action that saves lives. Before and I came into office, only borrowers had received student debt relief through Public Service Loan Forgiveness. We made it easier for teachers, firefighters, and others to have their debt forgiven \u2014 and as of today, public servants have benefitted. Louisiana\u2019s abortion ban criminalizes doctors and includes no exceptions for rape or incest. This extremism has real consequences with one OB/GYN warning, \"There are going to be deaths that didn't have to happen.\" We must restore the protections of Roe. Let's dance. Eid-eh Shoma Mobarak \u2014 happy Nowruz and happy New Year to all those celebrating. In these challenging times, Nowruz's promise of renewal offers us hope as we stand together and pray for prosperity, health, and peace around the world. My mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a scientist who had two goals in life: to cure breast cancer and to raise her two daughters.

Further, the omnibus appropriations legislation provides a significant down payment on critical disaster assistance for millions of Americans affected by recent storms and fires, as well as continued support for the Ukrainian people fighting for their freedom and survival.

Honored to welcome Ms. Lee to partake in this important moment in the Japan-U.S. relationship. Kansas recently welcomed the Japan-based company Panasonic to build a electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto. These kinds of partnerships bolster the economies of both our countries and advance our shared technological priorities. Sec. Mayorkas has an obligation to use the tools Congress provided to enforce legislation Congress has already passed. Waiting for comprehensive reform is an excuse to do nothing. Mayorkas\u2019 inaction & leniency towards enforcing the law has resulted in the crisis at the border. Today, the women who stepped up to help manufacture planes during WWII & who were the inspiration for the icon \u2013 Rosie the Riveter \u2013 received a Congressional Gold Medal. Connie Palacioz of Wichita was one of the original Rosies who worked on the Superfortress during WWII. For years, NATO has served as a pillar of security, deterring adversaries and protecting our world as the most successful alliance in history. In today\u2019s complex and dangerous world, NATO is essential to preserving American peace and prosperity. The historic failure at our southern border is not an accident. Migrants know the Biden admin resists detaining those who cross the border illegally, has failed to harden border infrastructure & the admin's abuse of the parole system increases the chances of remaining in the US. Joining my colleagues on the Senate Floor at ET to discuss the national security crisis at the southern border. Watch live here On we pay tribute to our nation's Former POWs- especially the servicemembers who were imprisoned in the Bataan Peninsula during WWII.

Watch here After hearing President Biden\u2019s SOTU, it is no surprise his budget proposal calls for an historic amount of spending & new taxes. His proposal doubles down on the same failed policies that have exacerbated inflation, the border crisis & halted American energy production. The American people have felt the burden of President Biden\u2019s policies at the grocery store, gas stations & utility prices. Excess spending and raising taxes are not the solution to the problems facing our nation. The President\u2019s proposal is just that \u2013 a proposal. I will evaluate the details of the President\u2019s budget and work with my Senate colleagues to craft appropriations bills that supports jobs and American competitiveness while maintaining responsible fiscal boundaries. Caregivers are the forgotten heroes to the post-service success of our nation\u2019s veterans. I joined my colleague in introducing legislation that expands caregiver transition programs once their services are no longer needed. The PACT Act helps thousands of veterans and their families. With its expansion, we must make certain that VA is prepared and delivers on its promise that toxic-exposed veterans receive the support they have earned and deserve. My full response to President Biden\u2019s State of the Union address: The state of chaos at the southern border is nearing breaking point. Biden must take action to end this national security crisis by fortifying the border, slowing illegal migration & detaining criminals. Great to have honorary Kansan, Sen. Elizabeth Dole, attend & speak at the VA committee hearing today. As a veteran caregiver, she advocated for the Elizabeth Dole Home Care Act, which helps VA better support veterans & their families.

Thank you to everyone across Kansas who has helped those in need! Cecil O\u2019Brate was a farmer, entrepreneur, businessman, philanthropist, and a good friend and mentor. Cecil was a strong advocate for southwest Kansas and held an extraordinary commitment to help others succeed. Through his investments in the community & generous scholarships, Cecil & his wife Frances have positively transformed countless lives. I have no doubt the O\u2019Brate Foundation will continue to provide educational opportunities to Kansans for years to come. To nearly everyone Cecil O\u2019Brate met, he would share that there was no substitute for an honest day\u2019s work, an inquisitive mind, and a desire to always do more.

I applaud Chairman and his colleagues for listening to the whistleblowers who came forward in their pursuit of justice. Harassment cannot be tolerated in any workplace, let alone the VA office that sets the workplace conduct standards for the entire department. The strikes by U.S. and allied forces are a necessary step to degrading the capabilities of the Houthis and the threat they pose to one of the world\u2019s most critical chokepoints. President Biden and his administration must get serious about applying pressure on Iran and its proxies to punish the terrorism they wage against the U.S. and our interests in the Middle East.

This week I met with Comptroller General Gene Dodaro from to discuss the on-going investigation into the mismanagement of the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) which I initiated after whistleblowers contacted my office with concerns for the health & safety of veterans nationwide.

It would disrespect Alaska Natives on the North Slope, who were ignored in a sham public process. It would openly defy federal law while ignoring rising energy prices and growing global volatility.

I always appreciate our annual meetings during Capitol Connection with Awake America Ministries. Congratulations to on a historic run and winning the ACC Championship! It was a pleasure to meet with North Carolina members of this past week at my DC office. As Senator, I will continue to be an advocate to eradicate antisemitism here at home and support our ally Israel in its mission to destroy Hamas. It is outrageous for President Biden and Chuck Schumer to be meddling in the free democratic election of one of our closest allies. Israelis can make their own decisions independent of an American president who is more concerned about winning Michigan than standing by our ally. It\u2019s clear President Biden\u2019s priorities are reckless sanctuary policies over the American people\u2019s safety. It's time for Congress to step in and put an end to this madness. That is why this week, I introduced two bills to hold sanctuary cities accountable and empower ICE to gain\u2026 Thank you for hosting today's roundtable with Nick Saban and ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips to shine a light on this important issue. .: Tillis bills target sanctuary cities after Laken Riley's death Under Biden, there have been over million illegal border crossings, and his administration still has no plan to fix the crisis of their own doing. Biden\u2019s anti-energy policies have weakened America\u2019s energy independence and are benefiting enemies like Russia, China, and Iran at the expense of the American people. The media has been tougher on for a story highlighting the tragic consequences of human trafficking than they are on Biden for allowing million illegals into our country. We are not better off with the crippling inflation we see every time we go to the grocery store. We are not better off with a raging crisis at the border that was caused by this failed policies. We are not better off with a who abandoned our\u2026 Phenomenal job by last night. And she is exactly right, the American people know we can do better. With a change in direction, we will do better. Tonight, we saw Joe Biden fail to take accountability for his failed policies. Americans know that our great nation can do better. And with a change in direction, we will do better. He was indeed taking a nap. Because of the hard work of North Carolina\u2019s farmers, North Carolina is the producer of sweetpotatoes in the U.S.! I was glad to join this morning to welcome commission members to our nation\u2019s capital. High prices and burdensome regulations are crushing small businesses and raising costs for working families. It was an honor to catch up with Senator Elizabeth Dole today. She continues to tirelessly advocate for our nation\u2019s veterans. The Senate will greatly miss Senator Sinema\u2019s strong bipartisan leadership.

Biden\u2019s trip to Texas is nothing more than a photo-op. Under Biden\u2019s watch, nearly million illegal immigrants have entered our country. More will continue to come into our country illegally until he uses his authority to fix the problem. . is a true legend of the U.S. Senate. Under his historic leadership, the Senate secured a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, passed historic tax reform, and enacted bipartisan legislation to save our economy from the brink at the start of the pandemic.\u2026 As President, Biden decided to: -Halt border wall construction -Cancel Remain in Mexico -Allow Title to expire -Rely on failed policies like catch & release And because of all this, we\u2019ve seen the worst border crisis ever unfold at our Southern border. Bad policies can have tragic consequences. Instead of deporting this illegal immigrant, Biden gave him parole. When this same illegal was arrested for harming a child, the sanctuary jurisdiction of NYC released him back on the streets instead of handing him over to ICE. This is a tragedy that could have been avoided. It is a failure at every level of government. Biden repealed all of Trump\u2019s executive actions that secured the border, and has mass released illegals (including potentially this suspect) instead of detaining and deporting them.\u2026 During Biden\u2019s first days in office, he took executive actions to weaken our border security. This crisis could\u2019ve been addressed long ago. Instead, Biden has been playing political games and appeasing leftists. After years, America is back on the moon! Congratulations to all the men and women of , , and who contributed to Odysseus\u2019 historic moon landing. Liberal protestors are deploying new tactics by blocking roads and stopping traffic. This reckless and dangerous behavior must be stopped. That is why I have introduced legislation to make blocking roads, highways, and bridges a federal crime. Another disastrous decision from Biden that will leave the American taxpayer footing the bill. Student loan forgiveness is nothing more than a redistribution of wealth at the expense of hardworking taxpayers. Far too many murder cases go unsolved, leaving families of victims without justice. I\u2019m proud to introduce the bipartisan VICTIM Act, to provide the necessary resources to law enforcement agencies to reduce the number of unsolved homicide cases and make our communities safer. Hillary Clinton went to Munich and needlessly fear-mongered and scared our allies by claiming Trump will unilaterally withdraw from NATO (he can\u2019t and won\u2019t). The irony is that Trump\u2019s tough talk pushed our allies to start meeting their spending obligation. It was Hillary who\u2026 Navalny laid down his life fighting for the freedom of the country he loved. Putin is a murderous, paranoid dictator. History will not be kind to those in America who make apologies for Putin and praise Russian autocracy. Nor will history be kind to America\u2019s leaders who stay\u2026 Ah yes, Russia is so much better than the U.S. with all those cheap groceries and lavish subway stations! The Soviets had a term for people like Tucker: useful idiots. Good. Happy Valentine's Day to the love of my life, my wife Susan. I love you! This Congress cannot be remembered in the pages of history for emboldening Putin and Xi. That\u2019s why I voted in favor of the national security assistance package to support Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. Law enforcement officers are heroes who risk their lives to protect our communities. Anyone who commits senseless acts of violence against law enforcement officers must be held accountable. That\u2019s why I introduced a bill that would create harsh federal penalties for criminals who\u2026 Is this a joke? The Amendment case before the Supreme Court today is exactly why I have introduced the Constitutional Election Integrity Act. Liberal partisan activists shouldn\u2019t decide who we elect as our next President. Congratulations to on its new facility in Winterville! My staff was proud to attend the groundbreaking to support this wonderful organization that will be helping even more children and families in Eastern North Carolina. I commend Senator Lankford for the hard work he put in during months of negotiations, especially on asylum and parole reform, and he secured the best deal he could with an administration that tried to put up every roadblock imaginable. With that said, I have repeatedly said it\u2026 Thank you to the members of the for inviting me to speak at about the importance of supporting women and young farmers of the . Because of their hard work and contributions, North Carolina's agriculture community has boosted our economy and\u2026 Radical left-wing protestors blocking roads, highways, and bridges to shutdown traffic is reckless, dangerous, and could even get someone killed. It\u2019s time for Congress to pass my bill and make this out-of-control behavior a federal crime. These radical left-wing activists are bragging that they shut down roads and blocked traffic in D.C. They know there will be no consequences because of DC\u2019s weak-on-crime politicians. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve introduced legislation that makes this a federal crime. No more slaps on the\u2026 Liberal politicians and Biden\u2019s open border policies have turned NYC into a real-life Gotham City. I\u2019m sure NYPD would have liked nothing more than to turn this pathetic criminal over to ICE for deportation. But they couldn\u2019t because of NYC\u2019s sanctuary city policy. Great hire! Instead of clawing back money to pay off our debt, some Republicans are intent on spending every single taxpayer dollar they can, even if it\u2019s to send checks to illegal immigrants as this bill does. This is not a good example of how Congress is supposed to make law. House Republicans are rushing through a bill they wrote with Senate Democrats that would send checks to illegal immigrants and subsequently allow Democrats to hold an extension of the Trump tax cuts hostage. This is not a good idea, . I immensely enjoyed meeting with the FIRST Robotics Competition team at my DC office. Not only are they breaking barriers as an all-girl team, but they are paving the way for future generations of women in STEM. I am proud to support the G-Force Robotics girls and\u2026 This is no doubt another attack from an Iran proxy, this time with tragic results. My condolences go out to the families of the servicemembers killed in this terrorist attack, and I\u2019m praying for the full recovery of our servicemembers who were injured.

I'm glad to see the CHIPS Act provide smart federal investments to boost regional economic development & our innovation ecosystem. Shutting down our liquified natural gas exports is an insane decision by President Biden, caving to the far-left fringe of his base. It's terrible for America's economy. It\u2019s terrible for America\u2019s national security. And the biggest winner of this is Vladimir Putin. Access to a quality education remains one of the biggest roadblocks to ensuring that each and every child in our country has a shot at achieving their American Dream. That\u2019s why we need #schoolchoice. School choice is helping to break that barrier by empowering students and\u2026 I have no patience for Hamas sympathizers. Susan and I send our most heartfelt condolences to and his family following Bobbi's passing.

For all those in the affected area, please be careful while on the roads this weekend and follow warnings from local officials. The American people should be able to elect the president of their choosing, not radical judges and left-wing activists. Out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs continue to skyrocket putting more pressure on hardworking Americans\u2019 pocket books. My colleagues and I recently called on Biden Administration officials to use the tools available to lower rising out-of-pocket costs for Americans. This is exactly why catch and release is bad policy. Violent, dangerous illegal immigrants are being empowered to stay and live in our communities through Biden\u2019s weak immigration policies. Because of Biden\u2019s failed policies, our Southern border has gotten completely out of control.

If you are a veteran in crisis or concerned about one, call the Veterans Crisis Line then press .: Sen. Thom Tillis moves to block other states from disqualifying Trump after Colorado decision American voters, not partisan activists, should decide who we elect as our President. My Constitutional Election Integrity Act would put any constitutional challenges in the sole place they belong: the Supreme Court. It\u2019s outrageous to see left-wing activists make a mockery of our political system by scheming with partisan state officials to remove presidential candidates from the ballot. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll be introducing legislation to stop this nonsense and ensure any constitutional challenges\u2026 This is awesome. It's heartwarming and incredible to see young North Carolinians like Landon embracing the true North Carolina spirit to help one another, especially during Christmas. The Biden Border Crisis continues to reach new heights because of the policies this Administration put in place. My staff and I are proud to continue this wonderful tradition with Tucker by sending messages of gratitude and support for our troops during Christmas. The numbers don\u2019t lie. Biden\u2019s failed border policies have fueled one of the greatest immigration crises our country has ever seen. Follow the money. China is a serious threat to America\u2019s national security. Despite being nearly miles away from Israel, the Houthis have made a deliberate choice to engage in Iran-enabled terrorism against the our partners and allies. The Biden Administration must take action and re-designate the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization\u2026 It would be a dereliction of duty to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on Israel and Ukraine\u2019s national security without providing the resources and policies needed to protect our own national security at the Southern border. I will only vote for a security funding package\u2026 Liberal politicians can\u2019t help themselves from defending their sanctuary city policies. Hardworking Americans' taxpayers dollar should absolutely not be used to bail out Democrats who recklessly protect criminal illegal immigrants. Biden could fix the border crisis right now if he wanted to. But we know he won\u2019t. I am proud to co-sponsor this critical legislation because I believe that illegal immigrants should never be getting more support from our federal government than our veterans. It is despicable that the Holocaust memorial in Greensboro was defaced. We have recently seen a surge of antisemitism and individuals displaying their bigotry against Jews, including even elected officials. We cannot allow antisemitism to become the new normal. I stand in support\u2026 Iredell County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies just seized enough fentanyl to kill million people. Fentanyl being smuggled across North Carolina is yet another consequence of President Biden\u2019s failure to secure the border. Every state is now a border state. A Salisbury to Asheville rail line would be a gamechanger for Western NC. I\u2019m proud this investment was made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that I helped negotiate, write, and pass into law. Anti-Israel protestors making a mess of the Senate. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll change hearts and minds by making hardworking Senate custodial workers spend their entire day cleaning up the mess they created. Thank you to Capitol Police and the Senate facility staff for upholding\u2026 Biden could end this crisis right now without a single bill being passed. His disastrous decisions and failed policies have fueled this crisis and will be a lasting stain on his legacy. This would be a shocking abuse of power by the Biden Administration. Seizing patents is a move that we see in dictatorships, not the United States. America leads the world in drug discovery and development, due to strong intellectual property protections. This misguided decision\u2026 Susan and I wish a Happy Hanukkah to all who celebrate! We proudly stand with all our Jewish friends whether they be in North Carolina or Israel.

President Biden and Democrats in Congress must work with Republicans to secure our border and\u2026 Today, we honor those who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor on December We will never forget their sacrifice. Our enemies and adversaries are using college campuses to undermine our nation\u2019s interests.

The DETERRENT Act is crucial to transparency and protecting\u2026 This will fail if it does not include substantial policy changes to secure the border.

This project is a big win for\u2026 Biden has been president for three years. And in three years, we have nearly four times the crossings that we did in the Trump Administration. Biden needs to fix the disaster his reckless policies have caused. Instead of issuing waivers, the Biden Administration must deploy every tool possible, including crippling sanctions against the Iranian regime, to hold them accountable for aiding and abetting Hamas\u2019 evil attack against Israel. Americans are going broke because of Biden\u2019s disastrous policies. If the continues at this pace, then by election day almost over million illegal immigrants will have crossed the Southern border. Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was a historic trailblazer and an inspiration to girls and young women across our nation. During her career, she earned the distinction of being among the fairest and most well-respected jurists. Susan and I extend our condolences to Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s family\u2026 The American people have sent a clear message that they are concerned about the crisis at our border. Biden needs to work with Congress and fix this problem. Henry Kissinger was a truly legendary figure in diplomatic history, his vast knowledge and counsel was subsequently sought by his successors in both parties. May he rest in peace. The is out of control. That is why I will not support a supplemental bill that does not include meaningful border security that will work to address managing future flows immediately. It's time for my Democrat colleagues to prioritize the American people by\u2026 I am glad the EPA reversed its decision to allow wastewater with GenX to be sent to a facility in Fayetteville.

Antisemitism has no place at the VA and this behavior should not be tolerated. should remove this employee immediately. Since Biden took office, more than million reported encounters at our Southern border have occurred. The state of our Southern border is the worst our country has ever seen and makes our country far less safe. I remain grateful for 's continued efforts to contain the wildfires in Western North Carolina. My office remains in contact with local leaders and stands ready to assist as communities begin to focus on rehabilitation efforts. It is a great relief that Aviva Siegel and Abigail Mor Edan have been released. However, Aviva\u2019s husband and NC native Keith Siegel remains a hostage after being kidnapped by Hamas. It is time for Keith and all other hostages to be immediately released.\u2026 In October, there were illegal immigrants encountered at the Southern Border. That's a increase from October The border crisis keeps getting worse, and for a third year in a row, the Biden Administration continues to ignore it.

Show support for your local North Carolina small businesses and shop small today on Small Business Saturday! #shopsmall As we gather with friends and family to celebrate Thanksgiving traditions, I want to recognize North Carolina farmers who provide quality products to feed our nation. As the state for turkey production, our NC poultry producers have much to be proud of. This Thanksgiving, I join all North Carolinians in taking time to be grateful and reflect on the gift of freedom and democracy we have in our country.

I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure America & Israel\u2019s economic relationship continues to grow during this difficult time. We\u2019ve heard it before and have seen what happens when antisemitism is normalized. And we are not going to let it happen here. We must stand by our ally Israel as it defends its people and its very existence. And we must fight off antisemitism here in America. The world has watched devastating events unfold in the Middle East at the hands of Iran-backed Hamas. The free world, including the U.S. has long designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. It\u2019s long past time for the UN to do the same and enforce sanctions. The men and women who serve in the National Guard and Reserves provide an invaluable service to our nation. I am proud to co-sponsor bipartisan legislation that will ensure protections for members if they fall on financial hardship. Happy Birthday to our great state, North Carolina! On this day years ago, the General Assembly ratified the U.S. Constitution, making North Carolina the state to be admitted to the Union. Wishing the best of luck to the North Carolinians competing in this year\u2019s National Dog Show! Most Americans calling for a cease-fire are sincere in not wanting to see more innocent civilians lose their lives. This is a fair position; however, it is not a realistic one, especially if the end goal is to truly save lives and end the cycle of violence in the Middle East.\u2026 The recent amendments proposed to the Constitution were appalling and I am glad to see that they were defeated. The proposals were a flagrant attempt to disenfranchise state tribes like the Lumbee Tribe, while stripping them of having a voice on tribal matters.\u2026 .: North Carolina politicians question EPA on approval of GenX waste imported to Chemours The toxic work culture at the is inexcusable and it\u2019s clear that there have been major leadership failures at the top that have allowed this behavior to go unchecked. Desperately needed changes at the FDIC are not possible if the agency is still being led by an\u2026 The violence from protestors that occurred last night outside of the DNC was appalling. Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack against innocent Israelis was pure evil and should have united us all against hate, not fueled out-of-control, pro-Hamas protests. Susan and I are excited to see another tree from Ashe County selected for display at the ! Earlier today, my staff joined local leaders from the Fleetwood community to congratulate Cline Church Nursery on this beautiful honor and to send off the White House Christmas\u2026 One hard lesson America learned from the COVID pandemic is that we should never put ourselves in the position to be dependent on China. As President Biden meets with Xi Jinping, I hope he speaks from a position of strength instead of making new concessions to our adversary. President Biden's disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal was a massive setback for stability within the Middle East. Now, more than ever, we need to send a clear message that Iran-enabled terrorism against America and our allies will not be tolerated and met with swift repercussions. I am grateful for the continued work of , first responders, and local leaders to contain the wildfire in Western North Carolina. For residents in the area, please continue to heed warnings and follow directions from local officials to ensure everyone\u2019s safety. Susan and I send our deepest condolences to the SOAR family and Special Operations community and the families of the fallen soldiers. Their service and dedication to our country will always be remembered. We cannot allow radical voices to succeed in their attempt to normalize antisemitism. Americans who insist on speaking out in support of a ceasefire have a right to do so, but they also have a moral obligation to condemn antisemitism & the atrocities committed by Hamas. It was great to host another Bipartisan Safer Communities Act roundtable in Charlotte today. Thank you , NC Sen. Burgin, and other leaders for joining me for a thoughtful discussion on mental health care and school safety in North Carolina. Today, we celebrate years of The Few, The Proud. Happy Birthday, ! #SemperFi Absolutely heartbreaking. May they all Rest in Peace. We cannot continue to allow senseless crimes to go on unchecked at our border. We must do everything possible to stop the crisis at our Southern border and reduce future flows. Biden\u2019s failed border policies have allowed millions of illegal immigrants into our country unchecked. We cannot continue to risk the safety and security of millions of Americans. We must secure the border. Susan and I are praying for the two Robeson County Sheriff's deputies who were shot in the line of duty today. Glad to see the Secretary of Education act on the letter my colleagues and I sent requesting action to protect Jewish students amid rising antisemitism on college campuses.

I know the perfect person for the job\u2026 Please join Susan and me in praying for Gen. Eric M. Smith\u2019s health and recovery. When it comes to the border, Biden: -Halted border wall construction -Canceled Remain in Mexico -Allowed Title to expire -Relies on failed policies like catch & release Because of all this, we're seeing the worst border crisis ever. We must continue to remain united, denounce hate, and combat anti-Semitism in all of its forms. The Iranian regime is complicit in aiding and abetting Hamas\u2019 attacks against Israel.

We must secure the border and harden our laws to prevent foreign criminals and terrorists from infiltrating our communities. Iran is complicit in supporting and funding Hamas in its attacks against Israel. We must continue to put our foot on the pedal to apply as much pressure as possible to hold the Iranian regime accountable.

I am grateful for the brave work of the men and women of our NC . From protecting our coasts to conducting search and rescue missions to eliminating drug trafficking, our Coast Guard performs crucial duties to serve North Carolina and our country.

It's a disgrace that , who has a long history of anti-Semitic remarks, gleefully promoted Hamas\u2019 false propaganda that fomented outbreaks of violence across the Middle East. She\u2019s now refusing to take down her lies. She needs to be held publicly accountable. Iran is the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism & its continued financial support of Hamas enabled the cold-blooded murder of innocent Israeli civilians. We must ensure the U.S. does not provide the Iranian regime with more resources to fund terrorism & attack our allies.

The Supreme Court made the right decision today. Colleges should not be able to discriminate against applicants based on the color of their skin.

Bernstein's failure on inflation demonstrate he's not a serious economist and not right for the job. Please join me in wishing all of our athletes the best of luck as they represent USA in Berlin! The number of unaccompanied minors at our Southern border has skyrocketed. We must hold those accountable for fabricating family ties or guardianship over a minor to enter our country illegally. This is deeply disturbing. We cannot turn a blind eye towards China\u2019s actions. We need to secure our border now! I enjoyed joining community leaders for the \u2019s Parallel Runway groundbreaking ceremony. As the seventh busiest airport worldwide for arrivals and departures, this new addition will go a long way in helping Charlotte enhance the travel needs of North Carolinians.

The Biden response has been severely lacking to the increased risk to unaccompanied minors of sexual abuse & human trafficking at the Southern border.

Congratulations to the Butler High School marching band on an excellent performance! They did a great job representing North Carolina at our nation\u2019s capital. Freedom is not free. That is why today, on Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedoms. We will never forget them. Biden\u2019s spiraling inflation has eclipsed hardworking Americans\u2019 paychecks. We must do everything possible to get our economy back on track and help Americans keep more hard-earned dollars in their pockets. Illegal immigrants are crossing our Southern Border because they know under the Biden Administration, they get to stay here instead of being quickly expelled. We need to stop this and regain control of our border. Congratulations to the new Women\u2019s Golf National Champions!! #GoDeacs After two years of reckless spending, we've seen sky-high inflation and our national debt balloon. Americans cannot afford any more of Biden, Schumer, and the Democrats' reckless spending sprees. Looking forward to joining the Foundation to participate in the #HatchCenter webinar on IP protections. Registration is still open! Through his partisan temper tantrums, it\u2019s clear that Roy Cooper isn\u2019t handling being a lame duck governor very well. The students put on an excellent performance! I enjoyed their singing and was proud to honor our nation's flag as they sang the national anthem on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Thank you to all the men and women of and the first responders who answered the call to help ensure the safety of North Carolinians. Susan and I are grateful for their courage and service to our community. Last month, there were illegal crossings along the Southern Border. And that was before Biden allowed Title to expire. Biden\u2019s disastrous policies and open borders have created a catastrophe at our Southern Border. Joe Biden\u2019s policies are failing North Carolinians. Special Counsel Durham\u2019s report on acts of bias within our intelligence community is deeply disturbing. The Senate Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing on this report and invite the Special Counsel to appear before us as soon as possible. There have been over million illegal crossings at the Southern Border. Under Joe Biden, we are seeing the worst border crisis in our nation's history. North Carolina's agriculture industry just passed a huge milestone: more than billion in economic impact. Commissioner Troxler set this goal and did everything he could to made it happen, a big testament to the dedication of our hardworking farmers. President Biden needs to appoint an independent investigator to look into what caused the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank, and Signature Bank. The American people deserve answers. Over the last year, North Carolina tragically lost three law enforcement officers who were killed by others in the line of duty, in addition to a number of officers who died from other causes, including car accidents and illnesses. Please join me in taking a moment to honor the\u2026 To the men and women in blue in North Carolina and across the country: thank you for everything you do. You deserve our gratitude. According to recent reports, over Camp Lejeune water contamination claims have been filed in the past months, yet the Navy has taken no action to resolve a single claim. I joined and a bipartisan group of NC legislators to demand answers. Congratulations to on a great maiden speech! I look forward to working together to secure wins for North Carolina. Terrorists and cartels see Biden\u2019s open borders as opportunities. This border crisis is a serious threat to our national security. Congress should take action to pass legislation I introduced with to extend Title expulsion authority. We need to restore law and order within our country, including increasing penalties for attacks against our brave men and women in law enforcement. I am proud to #backtheblue and to co-sponsor the Back the Blue Act. Americans cannot afford more of Biden and the Democrats' reckless spending sprees. President Biden and Chuck Schumer need to step it up and negotiate in good faith to get a deal that controls spending. I am proud to back North Carolina's men and women in blue. Thank you to all of our police officers for keeping us Wishing a Happy Mother\u2019s Day to all moms, especially my mom, my mother-in-law, my wife and my daughter. Thank you for all that you do! #MothersDay This is a complete and total failure of leadership. Joe Biden and his administration have failed the American people. I am glad a bipartisan group in the House has introduced a companion version of my bill with to extend Title expulsion authority. The Biden Administration had no plan to mitigate the fallout of ending Title and there is clearly bipartisan agreement that\u2026 Happy This is a good first step in the process of addressing the crisis at our Southern border. It\u2019s time for Biden and Congressional Democrats to take this border crisis seriously and begin discussing border security and enforcement legislation. Ending Title will be a catastrophe. When the Biden Administration allows Title to expire tomorrow night, our borders will be wide open. We\u2019ve got to stop this from happening and act quickly to extend Title authority. Our safety and national security are on the line. Because of sky high inflation and reckless government spending, too many North Carolinians are struggling to provide for their families. Because of this, I will not vote for cloture on any bill that raises the debt ceiling unless there are substantive spending and budget reforms. The Biden Administration has failed to secure the border and the situation will get even worse once Title is allowed to expire on Thursday. Thank you to all the farmers who joined and me for yesterday\u2019s Farm Bill listening session. We appreciated hearing about the many important issues impacting North Carolina\u2019s agricultural community. I\u2019ve received lots of feedback from servicemembers and have advocated for improving their housing conditions at Fort Bragg. So I was glad to tour Fort Bragg today with to see the work being done to build new barracks for soldiers. North Carolina has a proud tradition of military service, and I am grateful for the bravery and sacrifices of our men and women in uniform. To all our servicemembers, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all you\u2019ve done and continue to do. This is a crisis. Biden and Mayorkas have failed to take control and have left our borders wide open. Congress needs to take up legislation I introduced with to take action and extend Title authority to prevent catastrophic consequences at our borders. As the proud father of a nurse, I have a profound appreciation for our nurses. Thank you to all the nurses on the frontlines who took care of our nation during unprecedented times and for continuing to devote their time and efforts to providing quality care to others in need.\u2026 Biden\u2019s inflation crisis is still outpacing wages for most hardworking Americans. I applaud the NCGA for passing a commonsense bill to protect life. It represents the views of a vast majority of Americans by limiting abortion during the and trimesters with exceptions for rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, and protecting the life of the mother. This\u2026 The Biden Administration has failed to secure the border and the situation will get even worse once Title is allowed to expire next week. That is why I introduced bipartisan legislation with today to extend Title expulsion authority for two years. House Republicans did their job and passed legislation to take default off the table. Now, it\u2019s time for Biden and Schumer to negotiate in good faith so we can get a deal that gets spending under control. This murderer and dangerous fugitive remains at large. If you have any information or see this fugitive please contact your local FBI office. I applaud the great work being done by the #NCGA to protect North Carolina. I will continue working with my colleagues in Congress to get the bipartisan SOIL Act passed to further protect North Carolina farmers and our nation\u2019s food supply from foreign adversaries. Congratulations to Aegis Power Systems Inc. on being awarded this contract. I am proud to support North Carolina businesses because they not only fuel our local economy but also support our U.S. Armed Forces to defend our great nation. Now is the time President Biden to come to the negotiating table and reach a bipartisan deal to raise the debt ceiling. We need to do everything we can to avoid defaulting and getting our unsustainable rate of spending under control. Congress promised to recognize the Lumbee Tribe but failed to keep it. I am proud to lead the effort with to uphold the promise to the Lumbee Tribe, and I will continue to work across the aisle to get it across the finish line. Congratulations to Shirley Jones on completing her GED! Her resilience to life's challenges and determination to achieve her goals is truly inspiring. The Biden Administration wants to social engineer the housing market. What they don\u2019t seem to understand is that one\u2019s credit has nothing to do with their wealth. Biden\u2019s aggressive EPA regulation on heavy-duty vehicle emissions will hurt our trucking industry and raise prices for North Carolina families. I am glad that yesterday the Senate voted to pass legislation I supported to overturn this outrageous emissions standard. Lets be clear, the Fed\u2019s dereliction of duty to both identify and act upon glaring issues on SVB\u2019s balance sheet, combined with SVB\u2019s disregard of basic risk-management concepts, brought down the bank. We need competent banking regulators willing to enforce current laws, not ones\u2026 Congratulations on selecting Bryce Young! Excited for what the future holds and can\u2019t wait for the season. Thank you to all who joined and me yesterday for the briefing on human rights abuses in Turkey. We must continue to have these discussions and recognize the ongoing human rights atrocities taking place in countries across the globe. Thank you to the NCGA for their support, I am continuing to work with to build support in Congress and pass the Lumbee Fairness Act. Very important speech being delivered right now by the South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. I agree with him that we must do everything we can as an ally and friend to continue the partnership between the United States and South Korea. I applaud and the House for this important step. It\u2019s time for President Biden to come to the negotiating table and reach a bipartisan deal to avoid a catastrophic default. The Biden proposal to force people who are financially responsible to subsidize high-risk mortgages is outrageous. It's a gross injustice to hardworking Americans, and I will do everything I can to stop this madness. Today, on World IP Day, we celebrate intellectual property's role in fostering creativity and innovation in America and worldwide. I will continue to focus on the fight to protect our IP and technology from the Chinese Communist Party.

I applaud for its commitment to our great state, and I look forward to working with them on the federal level. My staff was proud to attend Minges Bottling Group's groundbreaking for a new facility in Ayden. This new facility will create more jobs for Eastern North Carolinia and expand upon the company's years of service. years ago, SGT Mike Verardo was hit by an IED blast while on patrol in Afghanistan with the Airborne. By the grace of God, he survived. I am thankful for his service to our nation and proud to call him a good friend. Today is a special day in North Carolina, marking Wounded Heroes Day. It is a day for us to celebrate SGT Mike Verardo's Alive Day and honor and recognize the selfless sacrifices North Carolina's veterans have made during their time of service to our beloved country. Proud to partner with and to honor SGT Verardo, and all of North Carolina\u2019s wounded heroes. The Chinese Communist Party is using every device possible to steal information from the American people. We must do everything we can to stop China\u2019s attempts to illegally spy on Americans. We should review sister city partnerships affiliated with China to mitigate the risk of corruption. I have co-introduced legislation to ensure transparency regarding sister city partnerships and activities to help identify potential threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party. There have been more than five million illegal border crossings at the Southern Border, the most in our nation's history. Mark your calendars kicks off tomorrow! Enjoy free admission to all parks in North Carolina on Saturday, April This is exactly why I have introduced the bipartisan SOIL Act, to protect both North Carolina farmers and the world\u2019s most abundant food supply from China. TikTok is a de-facto spyware app for the Chinese Communist Party. That is why and I are calling on all members of Congress to lead by example and not use it. Today, we remember the millions of precious lives lost in the horrific events of the Holocaust. We must never let this happen again and we must remain united as Americans to combat antisemitism in all of its forms. Right now, more than half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. We have got to do everything we can to get our economy back on track to help Americans struggling to pay their monthly bills. I will vote against any attempt by Senate Democrats to temporarily replace Sen. Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee. I deeply respect Senator Feinstein, but this is an unprecedented request solely intended to appease those pushing for radical, activist judges. This is especially\u2026 Instead of leading by example, some members of Congress are still using TikTok and encouraging their constituents to use the spyware app despite knowing the Chinese government is mining their info. The House and Senate should take steps to address members who disregard the\u2026 We need to cut through the bureaucratic red tape, remove burdensome regulations, and increase domestic energy production to get our economy back on track. #China is the greatest national security threat facing the United States. The Chinese Communist Party is actively trying to exploit campuses across our country to deploy nontraditional forms of espionage. This is just one of the many ways they undermine our national security. Biden's disastrous policies have skyrocketed inflation and energy prices. Susan and I wish our Sikh American friends a happy #Vaisakhi! Inflation has risen under President Biden. Everything costs more since Biden became our president. Today kicks off day two of 's Southeast Region Federal Construction, Infrastructure & Environmental Summit. Proud to co-host this event to allow attendees to learn more about how DoD and NC businesses work together to defend America. It\u2019s an honor to co-host with this year\u2019s Southeast Region Federal Construction, Infrastructure & Environmental Summit! Wishing all the attendees and participants a successful The Biden proposed rule is an outrageous regulatory overreach and an underhanded attempt to force all Americans to adopt their woke liberal agenda. It\u2019s also completely out of touch with reality: most families can\u2019t afford to spend for the average cost of\u2026 Efforts to modernize the VA electronic health record system are long overdue.

Wade is overturned, I would immediately call a special session of the legislature to ban abortion in Georgia. I've called on Brian Kemp to commit to doing the same. People deserve to know where their Governor stands on this issue. Great crowd at our meet and greet in Norcross this weekend! Wishing a Happy Mother\u2019s Day to all moms, especially my beautiful wife Bonnie. Great morning with the Fulton County GOP. Thank you for having me! Full house in Lawrenceville this morning! Together, we will eliminate the state income tax, stop the indoctrination of our kids, crush crime, and finally secure our elections. Joining live on Fox News around PM. Tune in if you can! Bonnie and I were delighted to be in Northeast Georgia this afternoon at the Rabun County GOP Headquarters. We\u2019re encouraging everybody across the state to get out and VOTE! Bonnie and I have had a great day in North Georgia encouraging everyone to get out and vote! Matthew tells us, \u201cFor where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them.\u201d Today & every day, Bonnie & I are praying for our state and country. As we travel across GA, we are humbled to hear from so many of you who are praying for us as well. Great to be with the Republican Women of Forsyth County this afternoon. The polls are open, get out and vote! I was extremely disappointed by the Governor\u2019s bureaucratic response to the news that the Supreme Court may soon overturn Roe v. Wade. Georgia voters deserve to know where their Governor stands on this issue. I\u2019m calling on Brian Kemp to join me in calling for an immediate special session of the legislature to ban abortion in Georgia after Roe v. Wade is overturned. You are either going to fight for the sanctity of life or you\u2019re not. Back on the campaign trail today encouraging everyone to get out and vote. Thanks to everyone who joined us in Augusta! My wife Bonnie and I are all over the state this week encouraging folks to get out and vote. Bonnie spoke to a group in Alpharetta this evening, and we\u2019ll be back on the trail again tomorrow! Wrapped up the day with a stop in Valdosta \u2013 great day on the trail! Kemp is giving away billion of our taxpayer dollars to bring a woke California company owned by George Soros here to Georgia. Brian Kemp is giving BILLION of our taxpayer dollars to a woke company owned by George Soros. It\u2019s absolutely outrageous. Thanks to everyone who joined us in Rutledge today to call out this nonsense. Bonnie & I believe every child is a gift from God. Any ruling from the Supreme Court that would save innocent lives would be an historic milestone. If I were Governor when this ruling was issued, I would call the legislature back into a special session to ban abortion in GA. Good morning from Waycross! Next stop: Thomasville There is word tonight that Roe v. Wade may soon be overturned. Bonnie and I are hopeful that\u2019s the case. This potential ruling shows the importance of the three conservative Supreme Court Justices we confirmed working with President Trump while I was in the U.S. Senate. When I\u2019m Governor, Georgia will be the safest place in America for the unborn. Brian Kemp just announced his plans to give billion of Georgians\u2019 tax dollars to a George Soros-owned woke corporation. Think about how many small businesses in Georgia could be helped with this kind of money, instead of padding Soros\u2019 pockets. This is the worst deal I have ever seen in my years in business \u2014 in taxpayer money per potential job. Only a desperate politician looking for an election year headline would cut a deal this outrageously dumb. Full statement: Don\u2019t forget to dial in at You don\u2019t want to miss this, folks.

They shut our schools down and then forced our kids to wear masks for TWO YEARS. On COVID, Ron DeSantis got an \u201cA\u201d for keeping schools open, but Brian Kemp got a \u201cC,\u201d according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. On Kemp\u2019s watch, Abrams & Soros have infiltrated our schools and are teaching kids to believe that voter ID is \u201cracist.\u201d It\u2019s time to stop the indoctrination, get the woke mob out of our schools, and put parents in charge. #GAGov #GAPol The election was rigged and stolen. Brian Kemp was complicit in the fraud. He allowed it to happen. He\u2019s covering it up. Now he\u2019s suppressing evidence. As bad as that is, Kemp\u2019s biggest crime is that he has divided us and cannot win in November. Tune in to tonight\u2019s debate at #GAPol Don\u2019t forget to tune in at p.m. tonight to watch the debate!

He allowed it before the election, and refused to fight it after the election. Atlanta has one of the highest inflation rates in the country. It\u2019s time to eliminate the state income tax and let Georgians keep more of their hard-earned money! Crime is out of control across GA. We\u2019re short approximately officers in our major cities alone. In ATL, rapes and murders are up There are more murders per capita in Atlanta than Chicago. It\u2019s not just Atlanta. Folks don\u2019t feel safe on Brian Kemp's watch. The difference between me & Kemp? Kemp believes Joe Biden won fair and square. Georgia conservatives all know better. Kemp was too weak to fight and wanted Republicans to accept the fraud, shut up, and move on.#GAGov #GAPol Here we go! You can watch here\u2014 roll. Fired up and ready for tonight\u2019s debate. Don\u2019t miss it \u2014 p.m. Our Governor said when asked about crime in Atlanta, particularly the vote in Buckhead, 'I'm going to keep my powder dry.' That's what politicians say when they're going to do nothing. Great night in Watkinsville with a fired up crowd! Brian Kemp has spent months claiming Joe Biden won fair and square. But now, Kemp is trying to change his tune admitting, \u201cThere\u2019s fraud in every election.\u201d Even worse, Kemp wants Republicans to just accept the fraud, shut up, and move on. I just stepped off the debate stage and our momentum is stronger than ever. Chip in to help our Trump-endorsed campaign WIN and defeat Stacey Abrams once and for all>>> #GAGov #GAPol Tonight was a great win for our campaign. We exposed that Brian Kemp is a weak governor who divided our party. With your help and your vote, we will win the primary and defeat Abrams in November! Keeping your powder dry?! People are getting killed on the streets of Buckhead, but wants to keep his \u201cpowder dry.\u201d There are more illegal aliens in Georgia than ARIZONA. Remember when Brian Kemp pledged to round \u2018em up in his pickup truck? Governor, did your truck break down? From deepening the Port of Savannah, to rebuilding the military, to delivering COVID relief, I\u2019ve been focused on getting results for ALL Georgians. Bonnie and I wish each of you a Merry Christmas! We hope you are filled with joy and peace today and throughout the New Year. In this crisis, my priority has always been to protect the people of GA and help drive recovery efforts. Today we delivered: \u2192 More PPP for small biz \u2192 round of relief checks \u2192 Funding for hospitals & schools \u2192 Efficient vaccine distribution \u2192 Support for farmers Today, we will deliver nearly trillion in additional aid on top of the trillion already disbursed. Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi made this harder than it needed to be, purposely holding up relief that could have been delivered months ago.

Great opportunity for high school students interested in #STEM to work with researchers. The first shipments of vaccine have arrived in Georgia!

We will always remember the brave patriots who fought at Pearl Harbor on December No one understands the price of freedom better than those who have served and sacrificed. When hit, & I both supported bipartisan relief and we are fighting to get more targeted relief to the people of Georgia right now. While it's encouraging to see some of our Democrat colleagues come back to the negotiating table after their previously outlandish demands that had nothing to do with COVID, let\u2019s not forget that every single Senate Democrat blocked this kind of additional relief just weeks ago. It\u2019s time to get more relief to the people of Georgia right now and Senate Democrats are the only ones standing in the way of making that a reality.

Shelling out per potential job for an unproven, Soros-funded start-up is downright reckless, but that\u2019s exactly what Kemp has done.

America must maintain its leadership in nuclear energy development. From lighting the first nuclear powered lightbulb to groundbreaking advanced reactor research, Idaho and the continue to play a crucial role in achieving this goal. With @SenWarner, I am launching the Senate Advanced Nuclear Caucus to showcase the Gem State\u2019s continued nuclear innovation and to expand opportunities for Congress to support nuclear research and development. State Rep. Jordan Redman and David and Nicki Warnick stopped by my office to say hello yesterday. I enjoyed catching up with them and discussing our shared Idaho values. The Senate must hold a full impeachment trial of Secretary Mayorkas. The crisis at our southern border clearly shows a failure to enforce our immigration laws. Last night, Vicki and I had the opportunity to meet Idaho\u2019s Cherry Blossom Princess Liz Ortmann from Kimberly. We loved hearing about her career and education aspirations. She has a bright future! INL is a big deal for Idahoans. It\u2019s a big deal for Americans. And it\u2019s a big deal for cybersecurity.

Our support for these local gems is critical to ensuring small businesses stick around for years to come. million illegal immigrants have crossed our southern border because President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas won\u2019t enforce our immigration laws. Effective enforcement mechanisms, like the border wall and Remain in Mexico, must return. President Biden keeps singing from the same song sheet in order to win political points. His efforts to \u201cforgive\u201d student loans will just push that cost onto taxpayers. It\u2019s not forgiveness, it\u2019s redistribution of debt. Today, we honor our nation\u2019s Gold Star Spouses for their unwavering resilience and strength. We thank you and your family for your sacrifice and service. Since President Biden has nearly cut our Strategic Petroleum Reserve in half. Now the Biden admin is going back on its word to refill the SPR while at the same time cutting domestic energy production and further exacerbating the problem. High prices of everyday goods are forcing Idahoans to make difficult financial decisions just to pay for necessities, like groceries and rent. Contributions to savings accounts have decreased and credit card debt has skyrocketed. The American people and their pocketbooks cannot\u2026 Democrats are politicizing oil and gas industry mergers to drive their unrealistic green energy aspirations. This review process requires the FTC take a fair, economically sound, and consumer focused approach, not one fueled by a political agenda. Idahoans are still forced to endure reduced hours of operation at the Porthill Port of Entry. With and , I am again demanding the Biden admin be reasonable and return to normal operating hours. In the last six months under President Biden, more individuals on the terrorist watch list have crossed the southern border than all four years under the previous administration. Our immigration laws haven\u2019t changed since then, just the enforcement directives. Vicki and I wish you a blessed Easter! #HeIsRisen America\u2019s Vietnam Veterans never received the welcome home they deserved. Today, on Vietnam War Veterans Day, we can try to make up for this wrong by honoring and thanking any Vietnam veteran you know or see. Access to capital remains one of the biggest challenges small businesses face. The Biden admin\u2019s proposal to insert the federal government in a process private lenders have handled well for years does nothing to help our small businesses thrive. The Biden admin\u2019s weaponization of the tax code to stifle US energy production fails to utilize the full potential of our abundant domestic resources and strips good-paying jobs from hardworking Americans. Investments in American-made energy are investments in our national\u2026 President Biden\u2019s EV mandate is unrealistic and fails to consider our supply chain and electrical grid. Since President Biden took office, housing prices skyrocketed, gas prices rose, the contents in potato chip bags decreased, and Idahoans are paying more every month to keep up. MILLION illegal immigrants crossed the southern border since President Biden stopped construction of the border wall, ended the Remain in Mexico policy, & halted enforcement of our immigration laws. Every one of these policies must be reinstated to get that number to zero. President Biden\u2019s VA\u2019s refusal to issue waivers for the construction of veterans homes fails those who put their lives on the line for our freedoms. Congress must pass the WAIVER Act immediately to make up for this administration. President Biden\u2019s FDA is dangerously advocating for mail-order chemical abortion drugs. My colleagues and I submitted an amicus brief in today\u2019s Supreme Court hearing in support of protecting women and girls from these harmful drugs. U.S. leadership in nuclear development, security of our critical infrastructure, and resiliency of the nuclear fuel supply chain is vital to our national security interests. My colleagues and I are asking to maintain US nuclear energy sources and ensure control of\u2026 Illegal border crossings have broken records every single month since August. Last month, illegal immigrants crossed the southern border. That\u2019s more crossings than any February EVER. The reality is that number should be zero. The president has the power to enforce the\u2026 Julie Su\u2019s record suggests a significant bias against many industries important to Idaho, including mining and agriculture. The president must rescind her nomination and instead choose an appropriate nominee for the Secretary of Labor. Today, on National Medal of Honor Day, I am calling for my colleagues to pass legislation to rename the longest highway in America as the National Medal of Honor Highway. These brave men and women deserve far more appreciation than this, but it is one small thing we can do for\u2026 From excessive spending to political handouts, procedural failures to irresponsible oversight, this spending bill fell grossly short of what Idahoans need. It ignores America\u2019s fiscal mess; prolongs the Biden border catastrophe, overreaching ESG and DEI\u2026 On I\u2019m proud to recognize the women whose strength and leadership help Idaho\u2019s ag industry thrive. I\u2019m fortunate to have spent the last years with my favorite woman in ag by my side. Idahoans don't want the government in the driver's seat when it comes to operating or buying a vehicle, yet the president is set on taking the wheel, setting unrealistic emissions standards, and diminishing purchasing power with this de facto EV mandate. Good luck to and in today\u2019s game against Colorado! I know you\u2019ll make Idaho proud! #GoBroncos The US cannot embrace the full potential of our domestic mining industry when projects are tied up in red tape for nearly a decade.

Idaho has long utilized the abundant natural geothermal resources just below its surface. With breakthrough technologies underway, there is great potential to scale up production of this clean, reliable energy. The GEO Act will streamline leasing and permitting processes,\u2026 The Biden radical green agenda contradicts science\u2014 U.S. air quality standards are the highest they\u2019ve ever been.

Over the weekend, Idaho received the great honor of having the newest member of the Navy's warships named after it. The ships\u2019 christening was truly done the Idaho way with water from Lake Pend Oreille, Payette Lake, Henrys Lake, and Redfish Lake. My interns are celebrating Are you? Laken Riley should be with us today. The least we can do is ensure another American life isn't stolen like hers by requiring ICE to arrest, detain, and remove any illegal alien who commits theft in this country. More than trillion over the next four years. That\u2019s the additional debt President Biden would add to the already massive national debt the American people must pay back. At a time when Idahoans are struggling to pay for inflation, this is not just tone-deaf\u2014it\u2019s dangerous and\u2026 Under President Biden, Idahoans are paying more each month just to keep up with the rising prices of everyday goods. Groceries cost more. Rent costs more. Gas costs more. Idahoans are tired of pinching pennies to make it by. It\u2019s beyond time to end the reckless spending. The president\u2019s inflated trillion budget proposal is chock-full of billions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including billions for the EPA to address a \u201cclimate crisis.\u201d In simple terms, this budget would give the Biden administration funds to establish even more\u2026 Even the left-leaning New York Times is acknowledging the burden Bidenflation has imposed on Americans. These recipes\u201d are proof that the president and democrats\u2019 spending habits are too much to bear. Inflation is up since President Biden took office. Yesterday, he unveiled a trillion budget proposal with a trillion deficit. Excess spending isn\u2019t the answer to inflation, it\u2019s the catalyst. Americans cannot afford Biden\u2019s agenda. I will not vote for any bill that allows any illegals to cross into this country. My red line is not one illegal entrant. We need to enforce the laws we have. The President tried to pass the buck for rising food costs by blaming companies for In reality, he\u2019s trying to cover up that his and business policies have led to the highest food price inflation in over decades and shrinkflation is to blame\u2026 This spending package is comes more than five months into the fiscal year, is jammed full of earmarks and the left\u2019s political priorities, and it fails to move towards reducing our national debt. This is not fiscal conservatism, and, as such, I cannot vote for\u2026 Loans are a pretty simple concept. The borrower agrees to pay back the full amount borrowed with interest. That isn\u2019t President Biden\u2019s definition however, and last night he bragged about his unfair student loan forgiveness scheme. I\u2019ve fought every illegal forgiveness effort by the president because it is just wrong to force Idahoans to cover these costs. You borrow it, you pay it. It\u2019s that simple. President Biden doubled down on his radical green agenda last night. That means more regulations, more red tape, and more jobs lost. America could be energy independent, but the president would rather appease environmental extremists. International women\u2019s day is about celebrating women around the globe for all they do. The women serving on my staff and leading my family are some of the strongest, most talented women I know. I am proud to celebrate their achievements today and every day. Immigration is one of the biggest issues facing America today, yet President Biden waited minutes to even touch it. Ridiculous. But remember, President Biden has the same laws President Trump had to address the crisis. Trump enforced them. Biden doesn\u2019t. Trump eliminated a crisis and constantly reminds us of how to combat the crisis. Biden plays the blame game and waits to bring it up. In tonight\u2019s #SOTU speech, President Biden doubled down on his open border policy and again tried to blame Congress. Biden\u2019s predecessor, with the current law, reduced illegal immigration to zero with executive orders requiring the border patrol to enforce the laws. President Biden rescinded those orders, and the result is illegal entrants invading our country every day. President Biden can reinstate President Trump\u2019s orders and reduce the flow of illegal migrants to zero\u2014if not, Trump will do so when he is elected. I will continue to fight for a zero number of illegals entering America. President Biden claimed in his speech that his administration is keeping the family farm going, but his aggressive regulatory agenda is threatening the existence of Idaho\u2019s farmers and ranchers. When the president talked about his Buy America bill, he conveniently forgot that his Secretary of the VA is allowing that very bill to be the reason veterans housing facilities across the country, including three in Idaho, won\u2019t see the updates they need.\u2026 With President Biden's SOTU tonight, I'm preparing to hear a lot of falsities, exaggerations, and a big effort to play the blame game. I'm sure we'll hear about the economy, immigration, and guns. And, I am certain he'll spin the realities of those issues... Just to set the record straight: - Liberal spending has worsened inflation & Idahoans pay more and more for goods today than they did when he took office. - The border crisis is worse because of the president's open border policies and refusal to use his statutory powers to\u2026 China is seeking every opportunity to diminish American national security, and here is yet another example. China is America\u2019s biggest threat. We must stop the CCP from harming us on our own soil. Joining Neal Larson and Julie Mason this morning on NewsTalk at (mt). Tune in here: ! America\u2019s veterans have waited far too long for updated facilities in Idaho & around the country. Due to choosing to selectively apply requirements, veterans will wait longer, & it will cost taxpayers more money for needed facility updates. illegal immigrants a day is too many. The Biden admin\u2019s attack on Idaho law is more than jeopardizing the lives of future generations; it is also threatening the balance of power between federal and state governments. The ATF wants to hold federal firearm license dealers to impossible clerical standards to make it harder to legally sell and buy firearms. This is the latest in the Biden war on your constitutional rights. Happy Idaho Day! On this day in President Abraham Lincoln created the Idaho Territory. I\u2019m thankful each and every day to call the Gem State home. On National Anthem Day, we memorialize the sacrifices made by our brave men and women and the accomplishments of our great nation. The land of the free and the home of the brave! Whether you pick up a newspaper, a good book, or the back of the cereal box, I encourage everyone to spend a little time reading on National Read Across America Day! On National Speech and Debate Education Day, I commend the students, teachers, and coaches across Idaho competing in speech and debate. These activities are essential for developing important critical thinking and communication skills that will propel the next generation into the\u2026 Improvements to soil health have long-lasting and significant economic benefits to Idaho\u2019s agriculture industry. I\u2019m glad to see Idaho\u2019s own Tim Cornie reap the benefits of successful soil management. President Biden continues to hide from his border crisis by going to the crossing with the lowest illegal encounters. This trip is proof he\u2019s not able to face the magnitude of the crisis, which includes more than million illegal migrant crossings during his time in office. He\u2026 Idahoans believe in the right-to-life & the Amendment. Since President Biden took office, both of these principles have been under attack. His HHS wrongfully interpreted EMTALA to allow ER doctors to provide abortions. This blatantly contradicts EMTALA\u2019s lifesaving purpose. I know it. Idaho knows it. America knows it. The millions of immigrants entering the US illegally is the elephant in the room the president cannot keep ignoring. Biden needs a reality check on EMTALA. EMTALA protects life. So does Idaho\u2019s law. The president is wrong. Biden\u2019s HHS is ignoring the fact there\u2019s no federal right to an abortion, misrepresenting federal law, attacking state laws, and pushing for abortion on-demand. To counteract this federal abuse of power, I submitted an amicus brief to SCOTUS. Julie Su\u2019s track record, including the loss of billions of dollars in fraud and promotion of labor unions, has failed America\u2019s workforce. America needs a Labor Secretary who will strengthen U.S. jobs. Julie Su has proven she cannot and will not fight for our labor force. Since day one, President Biden has stripped hard-working Americans of good paying jobs for the sake of his radical green agenda. The president\u2019s failure to invest in American energy is a threat to U.S. national security and economic stability. It is time for America to see the power of the US mining industry, invest in it, & secure our supply chain. To ensure not just economic success but also national security, Congress must revamp our mining laws & substantially reduce irrelevant regulations. The Biden admin is yet again forcing billions of dollars of student loan debt onto those who have already paid their debt or never took it on in the first place. Hardworking Americans now burdened by this \u201cforgiveness\u201d will never forgive President Biden. I\u2019m glad to see Idaho legislators opposing the Biden admin\u2019s open border policies \u2013 something I've been working on since he was inaugurated. Mr. President, open your eyes to reality. You have the authority, now do it. Secure the border. Under President Biden\u2019s three years in office, prices have risen and spending has gotten out of hand. It\u2019s time for Washington to get back to the basics: rein in reckless spending and drive down our national debt. The future of Idaho agriculture is in good hands with FFA\u2019s leadership and service. I am proud to celebrate the thousands of Idaho FFA members who work diligently to become the next generation of farmers, ranchers, and agricultural industry professionals. Idahoans cannot wait days for the FAA to grant emergency access to airspace when a wildfire is decimating our state. Before the wildfire season starts, the Biden admin must allow greater flexibility for aircraft to carry out time sensitive operations.\u2026 Interested in learning first-hand about public service and the day-to-day of the federal legislative process?

The VA promised Idaho a waiver to rebuild the Boise veterans home and protect veterans\u2019 care. Now, it\u2019s retracting that promise., issue the waiver and stop playing politics with our veterans. Idaho\u2019s farmers and ranchers work day in and day out to provide for our families and feed the world. From this rancher, happy #NationalAgDay to Idaho\u2019s ag community! Under President Biden, Idahoans are paying more each month just to keep up with the rising prices of everyday goods. Groceries cost more. Rent costs more. Gas costs more. Idahoans are tired of pinching pennies to make it by. It\u2019s beyond time to end the reckless spending. Loans are a pretty simple concept. The borrower agrees to pay back the full amount borrowed with interest. That isn\u2019t President Biden\u2019s definition however, and last night he bragged about his unfair student loan forgiveness scheme. I\u2019ve fought every illegal forgiveness effort by the president because it is just wrong to force Idahoans to cover these costs. You borrow it, you pay it. It\u2019s that simple. Immigration is one of the biggest issues facing America today, yet President Biden waited minutes to even touch it. Ridiculous.

Today, I extend my admiration, love and sympathy toward Gold Star Spouses. Thank you for your devotion, support and sacrifice for your spouses and country. Our hearts go out to you. Today we celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. May you enjoy this Easter with your family and loved ones. Wishing everyone a blessed Good Friday. On National Vietnam War Veterans Day, take a moment to recognize those who answered the call and to whom we owe a debt of gratitude for our nation\u2019s freedom. Thank you to the many brave veterans and POWs who served and sacrificed for our nation. Our nation\u2019s Medal of Honor recipients represent the bravest among us. Idaho has a rich history of servicemembers who fought heroically to defend this country. recognizes their service, selflessness and sacrifice. Thank you for your service. As part of my commitment to ensuring all Medal of Honor recipients and future recipients receive the recognition they deserve, I introduced legislation that is now law that designates U.S. Highway as the Medal of Honor Highway. Potatoes, sugar beets, wheat, dairy and more--Idaho wouldn't be the same without its agricultural community. National Agriculture Week spotlights how important farmers are to Idaho and America. That's why I will always fight on their behalf. I voted no on the second minibus. My opinions from the first have not changed. The EPA\u2019s rule on tailpipe emissions sets unrealistic & unachievable standards that go too far at restricting vehicle choices for American families and pushes our country toward a greater dependence on China. I urge the Senate to adopt my & amendment to block it. Record-high inflation under 's watch continues to hammer Americans\u2019 wallets, costing Idaho families more per month. the Administration recently doubled down on its spending agenda with a trillion budget proposal. This spending binge has to stop. Meet Natalee Alsuhili and Brooke Townsend, two interns in my Boise office this spring!

The time for accountability is now. & the Biden failing housing policies have contributed to record-high homelessness rates. I am proud to join RM Tim Scott in calling out the lack of accountability for the crisis this Administration created. The Biden Administration continues to push unfair SEC emission requirements on our farmers without increasing agricultural exports, putting a heavy burden on the agricultural industry. I will continue to protect farmers and their livelihoods from overbearing federal regulations. More than veterans, including hundreds in Idaho, could benefit from the changes brought by the Major Richard Star Act. It would correct a severe injustice and boast wide bicameral support. I look forward to the enactment of this measure. Equestrian sports have implemented rules to ensure the welfare of the horses, but changes are needed to address loopholes that allow the continued suffering of sored horses. Soring is an inhumane practice and the PAST Act would finally put an end to it. National Women in Agriculture Day celebrates the role #WomeninAg play as producers, educators and leaders for our agricultural communities. Today honors the over million female farmers in the U.S. whose hard work feeds families and fuels the economy. Thank you for all you do. In stark contrast to Republicans\u2019 achieved objective of lower taxes and competitive rates, President Biden\u2019s vision for American workers and companies is clear: higher tax rates for the majority, to support government subsidies for a few. The President must work to address Social Security's long-standing customer service and solvency issues. Unfortunately, his budget fails to include any proposals to protect and strengthen the agency, or ensure Americans receive the benefits they are owed. Today, the finalized its rule setting stringent emissions standards for certain vehicles. It is the most aggressive form of tailpipe emissions regulations ever crafted. This is a harmful de facto #EVMandate that will further decrease Americans\u2019 vehicle choices. I continue to fight to preserve Idahoans' access to affordable vehicles. You can read more about the steps I have taken to combat the Biden EV mandates on my website. National Agricultural Week is an opportunity to highlight the vast economic impact of the food and agricultural industries. According to these sectors generate trillion in U.S. wages, billion of which comes from Idaho alone. Idaho is a proud supporter of its agricultural communities. Our farmers work hard every day to ensure people are fed and wages are paid. That's why I fight just as hard to ensure that they don't have to worry about harsh and unnecessary burdens from the Biden Administration. The Biden Administration is so focused on its extreme regulatory agenda that it consistently ignores reality. Despite the U.S.'s strong process in reducing its emissions footprint, 's solution is to regulate American businesses out of business. This past weekend, Idahoans gathered to christen the USS Idaho, a new fast-attack nuclear submarine. As it has been over years since the commissioning of the last USS Idaho, it is about time for a new Idaho warship. When traveling abroad for spring break this year, be sure your passport information is up to date and that you have it on you at all times. Processing times for passports are currently weeks. More information can be found at Idahoans who require any assistance can still contact my office with casework. Enacting effective legislation to fix drug shortages requires bipartisan, bicameral collaboration. I will continue to work on solutions to end drug shortages and provide Idahoans and Americans nationwide with better, more cost-effective health care. Israel is a critical ally of the United States, but Israeli citizens should choose who represents them. I willremain steadfast in my support for Israel\u2019s right to defend itself from existential threats by hostile parties. America stands with Israel. With spring break travel on the rise, be sure to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) at before going abroad. This program gives you important safety updates and makes it easier for the U.S. embassy to contact you in case of emergencies. Our hard-working farm and ranch families have enough to worry about without adding the unnecessary burden of hiring compliance officers to handle SEC reporting. Dropping this requirement is the right call on a misguided proposal. Planning to travel abroad for spring break? Take the time to save the contact info of the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate to your destination. This information can be invaluable in emergency situations. It is infuriating that Laken\u2019s death was preventable if not for the lax immigration and crime policies of the Biden Administration. We can stop senseless acts from continuing by bolstering our policies to thwart repeat offenders. The JCT confirmed that the U.S. stands to lose billions in revenue under the OECD global tax plan. This comes as the Administration is poised to sign the deal that fails to properly protect American workers and businesses from foreign discriminatory taxes. The sharp decline in U.S. agricultural exports is avoidable, unacceptable and the direct result of the unambitious trade strategy of this Administration. We must do more to meaningfully expand market access and reduce trade barriers for American farmers. President Biden is proposing the same menu of tax hikes that not even a Congress could support, while promising even more government subsidies to counter the inflation that has run rampant under this Administration. Although this budget is unserious, Americans should pay close attention to the vision the President has laid out: massive tax hikes to fund a massive expansion of the welfare state. A competitive tax system is instrumental in manufacturers\u2019 decision of where to invest. Shoring up supply chains and making the TCJA tax reforms permanent would create a stable, healthy environment for manufacturers to invest in American jobs. . & I urged to share military enlistment data with states to better prepare students. The lack of data for educators makes it nearly impossible for states like Idaho to consider military service as a successful post-high school outcome for students. The increasing cost of labor for agriculture producers is unsustainable. If costs continue to increase as they have, it will put immense pressure on the food production model that has allowed us to be agriculturally independent. We must act now. Daylight Saving Time begins tomorrow for many regions of the nation. Make sure to 'spring forward' and set your clock one hour ahead before you head to bed tonight. Lumping appropriations bills together without consideration of the merits of each individually binds our hands to supporting too many wasteful policies. This does not set us on a much-needed path to getting our fiscal house in order. It was an honor to meet both Alyson and AnnMarie as part of the United States Senate Youth Program. Both demonstrated a strong sense of leadership and commitment to the communities around them and I look forward to their continued success. Ensuring everyone knows where to turn for help is one of my top priorities. The Local Response Act will ensure that people are directed to local response centers and given the support they need when they need it most. I am grateful for the many strong, intelligent and reliable women in my life. Happy International Women's Day to my wife, my daughters, my staff and the many women who make Idaho and America great. Once again, touted an optimistic review of his performance from the last three years that ignores reality. His words lack accountability and shirk responsibility. Let's take a moment to go over President Biden's last three years in office. Welcome to D.C., Tona! Today\u2019s passage of RECA by a vote of is a positive step forward in delivering downwinders in Idaho compensation they are long overdue. I urge the House of Representatives to pass RECA & help those impacted by fallout from nuclear weapons testing. Me too, Jim. There\u2019s been a pattern of shirked and lack of accountability for the last three years. Thank you, Carmelita Jones, and for taking the time to meet today. It was my honor to deliver Carmelita copies of the CRS honoring her late husband Bob Jones, signed by the Idaho Congressional Delegation to express our gratitude for tirelessly advocating for veterans. It is my pleasure to invite Tona Henderson, of Emmett, Idaho, and head of the Idaho Downwinders, as my guest for the State of the Union. Tona has been a tireless advocate for Idaho Downwinders and our work in Congress for the expansion of RECA. I will continue to fight for the passage of the Major Richard Star Act. More than veterans, including hundreds in Idaho, could benefit from this change. The WAIVER Act would require the VA to grant the necessary waivers it should have already issued for Idaho\u2019s State Veteran Home projects, allowing the projects to move forward so our veterans can continue to receive the services they have earned. The Major Richard Star Act would correct a severe injustice by providing combat-wounded veterans with less than years of service both their disability compensation and retirement pay without reduction. It must be included in the Fiscal Year NDAA. HAPPENING NOW At PM ET, I will join and , leaders of the Major Richard Star Act, in a news conference pressing for the inclusion of the bill in the Fiscal Year National Defense Authorization Act. Watch live here: Unsustainable increases to AEWR are causing more headaches and more stress for those working to get food on our tables. These challenges are harmful to small and family-owned farming operations in Idaho and threaten overall national food security. The Hearing Protection Act allows suppressors to be purchased in a similar way and time frame as a firearm. The Idaho Senate's support for our efforts in Congress shows that Idahoans care about the auditory health of our firearm owners. Happy Idaho Day! Today we commemorate President Abraham Lincoln's creation of the Idaho territory. Join me in celebrating this wondrous occasion by sharing your favorite photos, memories and stories of our great state. Overzealous bureaucratic rulings to punish law-abiding federal firearms licensees over minor paperwork infractions is the latest move in the Biden efforts to trample on Second Amendment rights by any means necessary.

Expanding access and lowering the cost of health care starts with growing our health care workforce. I\u2019m happy to deliver the resources and tools to train our next generation of health professionals at Marian University! While Donald Trump and Republicans debate whether the states or the federal government should decide a woman\u2019s right to abortion care, I\u2019m fighting to make sure WOMEN can decide. In Wisconsin, we respect hard work \u2014 and that means giving workers the voice, security, and dignity they deserve on the job. I stand with UW nurses in their fight to have their voices heard. I\u2019ve heard from Wisconsinites having a tough time with their health care costs, childcare bills, and housing expenses. I\u2019m proud to help ease some of these living costs for Wisconsin families so they can live comfortable lives and save for the future. I met with @SECNAV Del Toro to discuss how we\u2019re working to support our servicemembers, strengthen American shipbuilding, and keep our country safe. Too many Wisconsinites are struggling with high costs. I hear them loud and clear \u2013 I\u2019m proud to be helping expand affordable housing development, cut health care costs, and make child care more accessible. Trade cheats like China have undercut American shipbuilding, weakening our supply chains, hurting our workers, and endangering our national security. I\u2019m having none of it and calling on the Biden administration to hold China accountable. These are the consequences of Republicans overturning Roe v Wade. Wisconsinites know this all too well after having to live under an abortion ban. Sadly, other Americans now do too. It\u2019s cruel & I\u2019m fighting to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose. No one who needs an inhaler should be forced to ration or forgo their medication because of cost \u2014 all while big drug companies are turning record profits. I'm proud of my work to cap the price of many inhalers at and lower health care costs for Wisconsinites. Judges shouldn\u2019t be making health care decisions for women. Politicians shouldn\u2019t be making health care decisions for women. Regardless of where you live, a woman should have the freedom to make her own health care decisions. Period.

I\u2019m proud to help small businesses like Linda\u2019s Bakery cut their costs, keep their operations thriving, and grow our Wisconsin economy. Having an asthma attack can be scary, and not being able to afford your inhaler can be the difference between life and death. I took on big pharma and now asthma patients like Deangelo will see their inhalers capped at Veterans earn the care they get from the VA. I\u2019m glad to see our PACT Act delivering generations of toxic-exposed veterans their long-overdue benefits and also making sure veterans get the health care they earned. Capping inhalers at will be a breath of fresh air for Wisconsinites who are struggling to afford their life-saving devices. I\u2019m proud to have put big drug companies' feet to the fire, and now Wisconsin families have lower health care costs. The funding I secured for these Wisconsin projects will give our Northwoods communities better access to clean drinking water, affordable housing, and the resources they need to keep our communities safe. Any U.S. aid to our allies must be in line with our values. From expanding access to affordable housing and childcare to increasing access to mental health support, I\u2019m proud to deliver for Wisconsin service members, military families, and our veterans. We have a bill to give Americans the freedom to decide when and how to build a family. Republicans blocked it. We have a bill to restore Roe v. Wade. Republicans blocked it. Now, women are paying the price. I won\u2019t stop fighting to return these fundamental rights. Traveling Wisconsin, I\u2019ve seen firsthand the success of my Dairy Business Innovation Initiative in helping dairy processors overcome headwinds and add value to their world-famous dairy products. I\u2019m glad to see the support I secured helping dairy businesses reach new heights. When I said I\u2019d fight to lower health care costs for Wisconsin families, I meant it. I\u2019m proud that after my investigation into the high cost of inhalers, three of the biggest inhaler manufacturers have capped their inhaler prices at Wisconsin\u2019s veterans, service members, and military families sacrifice so much to keep our country safe. I was proud to honor their service and ensure they have the benefits and support they deserve. I was proud to secure resources for the Wisconsin dairy industry to help our processors and farmers innovate their products, reach new markets, and grow our economy. It was great to be with today to see their work in action! With our PACT Act, we\u2019re keeping our promise to our nation\u2019s veterans. Last month, we made it even easier for toxic-exposed veterans to get the health care they earned. Thousands of Wisconsin veterans have filed their PACT Act claims. File yours today! To get ahead of the fentanyl crisis, we must provide the tools and training necessary to keep our first responders safe on the job so that they can keep all of us safe. I\u2019m working to do just that. Sarah should still be with us today. I\u2019m working to pass my bill to honor her legacy, prevent future tragedies, and give our communities the resources to build safer walking and biking infrastructure. Today, and every day, I stand with the trans community in celebrating the courage and dignity of living life as who you are. We must keep fighting back against hate and work to create a future where all Americans have the freedom of full equality. I\u2019m wishing everyone celebrating today a Happy Easter Sunday! Ensuring our first responders, who are on the front lines of the fentanyl crisis every day, have the tools they need to do their jobs is critical in our fight against the opioid epidemic.

Happy Opening Day, Wisconsin! #ThisIsMyCrew Today, we honor and recognize all our courageous veterans who bravely served during the Vietnam War. Thank you and your families for the sacrifice and service to our country. Whether it\u2019s cracking down on chemical suppliers in China, securing our border, or increasing access to overdose reversal drugs, I\u2019m committed to ending the fentanyl crisis. Great to talk with law enforcement & public safety leaders in La Crosse about our mission to save lives. Regardless of how you are traveling, everyone should be safe on our roads. I\u2019m proud to help honor Sarah\u2019s legacy with this bill and give our local communities the tools they need to make our streets safer for bikers and pedestrians. Our small businesses are the heart of our communities and the key to our local economies' success. I am glad to see the funding I delivered helping entrepreneurs grow their businesses, expand opportunities, and move our Made in Wisconsin economy forward. This is the impact of taking on big drug companies and lowering the cost of inhalers to I am happy to hear from Wisconsinites who can, literally, breathe a little easier knowing they can get their lifesaving inhalers at an affordable price! Homeownership is out of reach for too many Wisconsinites, and we need to lower costs for working families looking to put down roots in our communities. I\u2019m working to make that a reality. If big corporations like Amazon want to operate in Wisconsin, they need to play by the rules and give their workers the benefits they are owed. I\u2019m glad to see these Wisconsinites getting the respect and dignity they deserve. I voted for the Inflation Reduction Act because I knew it would create & support good-paying jobs and move our clean energy economy forward, and that\u2019s just what we\u2019re doing! I applaud this historic pledge to use union workers to build our state\u2019s clean energy infrastructure. First, they overturned Roe v. Wade. Now, they are coming for women\u2019s right to get safe, effective prescription abortion medication. This is simple: leave women and their health care alone. Judges need to stay out of women\u2019s health care decisions. Getting prescription abortion medication is a personal decision, not the Supreme Court\u2019s or any politician\u2019s. This is another step in Republicans' fight to ban abortion nationwide and I am having none of it. Wisconsinites who have been victims of scams or fraud shouldn\u2019t have to pay twice & be further penalized by the IRS for being victims. I voted against the tax bill that created this nightmare, & now, I\u2019m working to right this wrong for Wisconsinites facing these penalties. For Wisconsinites like Vicki, a cap on inhalers will save them hundreds of dollars and ensure that the medication they need to stay alive will be within reach. For the Wisconsinites getting hit with this winter storm, I hope you are staying warm and stay safe if you are traveling! Capping inhaler costs at could be all the difference for families struggling to afford the health care they need. I\u2019ll call out price gouging wherever it exists because Americans shouldn\u2019t be ripped off just to get their lifesaving medications. Six years after the Parkland shooting, my heart continues to break for every family who has lost a loved one to gun violence. Gun violence is the leading cause of death for American kids & we can\u2019t allow this to be our new norm. We must do more to end the gun violence epidemic. Happy Birthday, Affordable Care Act! Passing the ACA & providing Wisconsinites with affordable health care is one of my proudest As Republicans continue to try to repeal it & gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions, I\u2019ll fight it at every turn. I voted this morning to deliver for Wisconsin. Taking on the fentanyl crisis, investing in our kids, growing our Made in Wisconsin economy, and so much more. I\u2019m proud to bring home wins for Wisconsin families. Buying a home is more than just a place to live. It provides stability, builds strong communities, & is part of the American dream. Sadly, it\u2019s too expensive for many so I\u2019m working to lower costs to put homeownership back in reach for more Wisconsinites. Big inhaler companies are raking in billions of dollars while Wisconsinites are being forced to ration their inhalers just so they can afford them. We took on these drug companies & months later, they capped their inhalers at This is the power of transparency. Happy #MarchMadness! I\u2019m wishing good luck to all our Wisconsin basketball teams headed to the NCAA tournaments. #OnWisconsin #RiseWithUs #WeAreMarquette We launched an investigation into big drug companies jacking up inhaler costs. Within weeks, three out of the four of them came clean and capped their costs at I will not stop fighting to lower health care costs and keep Wisconsinites healthy. Unfair trade practices by China in the shipbuilding industry jeopardize our national security & undermine American jobs. I called on President Biden to investigate China for rigging the game & met with today to fight for a level playing field for American workers. I\u2019m glad to see major drug companies cap their inhaler prices to after my investigation into their price-gouging tactics. I\u2019ll take on anyone to lower health care costs for Wisconsinites. Wisconsinites who want to pursue a career in farming should be able to do so without being locked out because of the cost. I\u2019m teaming up with to break down barriers to agricultural land ownership and make it easier for more Americans to enter the field. The opioid epidemic isn\u2019t a political issue. It\u2019s a moral one. That\u2019s why I\u2019m committed to working with everyone who wants to be a part of the solution to end this crisis and save Wisconsin lives. Our farmers and producers are the engine that keeps our Wisconsin economy moving forward. This National Agriculture Week, I\u2019m thanking the hardworking Wisconsinites who work day in and day out to feed our nation\u2019s families. If you\u2019ve noticed grocery products getting smaller but the price remaining the same, it\u2019s not you that\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s big corporations and their price-gouging tactics. and I have a bill to change that. Happy National Agriculture Day! I\u2019m grateful for our Wisconsin farmers, producers, and ranchers who work hard to keep our agriculture economy moving forward and feed the world. Today and every day, I\u2019m proud to support their critical work. Wisconsin makes things. We make the ships that defend our country and the engines that propel them. is part of that legacy, and it was great to have them in to discuss how I can support their work defending our country and the Wisconsin shipbuilding economy. Wisconsinites have been at the mercy of big drug companies jacking up the cost of their lifesaving inhalers and it\u2019s just plain wrong. I'm proud of my work to hold these companies accountable for ripping off our families who rely on inhalers to breathe easier. We launched an investigation into big drug companies jacking up inhaler costs. Within weeks, three out of the four of them came clean and capped their costs at I will not stop fighting to lower health care costs and keep Wisconsinites healthy.

I\u2019m grateful for our Wisconsin farmers, producers, and ranchers who work hard to keep our agriculture economy moving forward and feed the world. Today and every day, I\u2019m proud to support their critical work. Today, I heard firsthand from Milwaukee patients & providers about how the high price of inhalers is impacting our families. Wisconsinites should not be ripped off to get these lifesaving devices & I won\u2019t stop fighting to hold big drug companies accountable. Wisconsin families deserve to be safe in their communities, and I\u2019m proud to bring home the resources our law enforcement and public safety leaders need to keep our neighborhoods safe. News Glad to see yet another big drug company cap their inhaler prices to after I led an investigation into their price gouging tactics. I\u2019ll be in Milwaukee today to talk with Wisconsinites about how this will be a big win in lowering their health care costs. Women should have the freedom to control their bodies and health care \u2014 without having to travel across state lines. I am fighting for families, just like Megan\u2019s, to make sure that they have the right to decide their futures. I hope everyone celebrating in Wisconsin and across the world has a happy and safe St. Patrick\u2019s Day! I had a great discussion with Wisconsin law enforcement and public safety leaders who are committed to being part of the solution to ending the fentanyl epidemic. We can do this, but it will take all of us \u2013 working together. In case you missed it, the Street corridor in Milwaukee is getting a makeover thanks to the funding I helped deliver! These improvements will reconnect communities that have been divided by past highway construction & make it easier to access work, school, & opportunity. Collaboration with government & local leaders is key to tackling the fentanyl crisis. I joined Wisconsin law enforcement & public safety leaders today in Milwaukee to discuss our work to fight this crisis & keep Wisconsin safe. Protecting Social Security & Medicare, making the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes, and lowering prescription drug costs are all things I\u2019m proud to be fighting for. Wisconsin\u2019s shipbuilding industry has a strong history of supporting our economy and national security, but countries like China are rigging the system and hurting our workers. That\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting to bring shipbuilding back to America. My heart breaks for Nex\u2019s loved ones & the Owasso community. Nex, like too many LGBTQ+ kids, was bullied just for being their authentic selves. All kids deserve the freedom to live free from harassment. We must stand up to this hate & ensure those who are struggling can get help. Local leaders know best what their communities need, and I\u2019m proud to support them. Had a great meeting with members to talk about our work to expand affordable housing and ensure law enforcement has the resources they need to keep our communities safe. For too long, China has tried to rig the system with unfair trade practices that hurt American workers & our national security. I was proud to stand with American workers in calling on to investigate China\u2019s practices & level the playing field. I fought hard for these investments because they will make a real difference for Wisconsin families and businesses! Read more here When we make things in America, we support American jobs, American businesses, and the American economy. HAPPENING NOW: I\u2019m with and to call on the Biden administration to crack down on China\u2019s unfair trade practices and stand with American workers. Don\u2019t miss it! Tune in here It was a pleasure to have Waukesha Police Chief Thompson join me for the State of the Union and highlight the need for all of us \u2013 from down \u2013 to work together to tackle the fentanyl crisis, keep our communities safe, and turn this crisis around. I\u2019m proud to deliver for Wisconsin. These investments will give our communities the resources they need to keep our state safe, service members supported, and our businesses and economy moving forward! Take a look at a few of the projects I delivered for Check out the rest of these projects below to learn more! As we mark the first day of #Ramadan, I am wishing our Muslim communities celebrating in Wisconsin and across the country a safe holiday with family and friends. Wisconsin lost over people to an opioid overdose in We can and must do more to stop this epidemic and save lives. Chief Thompson and I were proud to represent those committed to being part of the solution at this year's State of the Union. I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: No American should go broke just to get the medication they need to stay healthy. I led the investigation into big drug companies\u2019 price gouging on inhalers and am glad to see them respond and lower costs for families. Incredibly saddened to hear of the heartbreaking news coming out of Clark County. My heart goes out to the loved ones of the nine lives tragically lost today. I am keeping their friends, families, and communities in my thoughts as we mourn this devastating loss. If we are investing taxpayer dollars, we better be using American workers, American materials, and American companies. I\u2019m proud to have successfully pushed the President to ensure we do this when we rebuild our highways and bridges. From expanding civil rights to growing our Made in Wisconsin economy, some incredible women have shaped the Badger State. On International Women\u2019s Day, I\u2019m celebrating all the women who have made our state and country stronger! The fentanyl epidemic doesn\u2019t know county or party lines. This impacts us all, which means it\u2019s going to take all of us to fight this crisis. I\u2019m grateful to have Waukesha Police Chief Thompson with me at the #SOTU as we push toward our shared goal of ending this deadly epidemic. With thousands of jobs and billions of dollars relying on our Great Lakes icebreaking capacity, it\u2019s crucial that we have the resources to get the job done. I\u2019m working to bring a new icebreaker to our waters so that our Great Lakes economy can keep sailing forward. We launched an investigation into big drug companies because the prices they were charging for inhalers just didn\u2019t add up. And looks like we were right. I\u2019m glad to see some of the price gouging end and proud to help lower costs for Wisconsin families. Wisconsin Veterans of Foreign Wars served our country bravely and put their lives on the line for our freedom. I was happy to have Wisconsin VFW members in today to thank them for their service and discuss the ways we can keep supporting them here at home. We had a bipartisan border deal to give law enforcement new tech to stop fentanyl from crossing our border. Republicans blocked it because of political games & now those tools are collecting dust. It's wrong & we need to pass our bipartisan compromise. Our police officers are on the front lines fighting the fentanyl crisis in Wisconsin. Tomorrow, I\u2019m bringing Waukesha Police Chief Thompson as my guest to the State of the Union address to highlight our push to end this deadly epidemic and save lives. Our firefighters dedicate their lives to serving our communities, & it\u2019s my job to ensure they have the resources and tools they need to keep Wisconsin safe. Thanks for stopping in , always thankful for your work in the Badger State! Thanks to our PACT Act, millions of toxic-exposed veterans who served our country can get the health care they earned through the VA. Direct enrollment starts TODAY! Apprenticeship programs at UA Local are giving Wisconsinites the skills they need to meet our economy's demands and secure a comfortable middle class life. I\u2019m proud to advocate for expanding these programs and it was great to be in Kaukauna to see this hard work in action! Charging consumers the same price for less product isn\u2019t inflation, it\u2019s shrinkflation. Big corporations have been using this deceptive tactic to boost their bottom lines and it\u2019s wrong. Americans deserve transparency and I\u2019m determined to get it. Apprenticeships are a time-tested way of growing our economy and expanding our middle class. It was good to be at UA Local Pipe Trades Training Center in Kaukauna today to meet with apprentices who are getting the training and skills they need to land jobs. Icebreaking on our Great Lakes supports thousands of jobs and ensures our shelves stay stocked with goods. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working to increase icebreaking capacity because our Wisconsin economy depends on it.", "Bidenomics continues to burn a hole in Americans\u2019 pockets. I met with Nebraska\u2019s Lumberman Association to learn how they\u2019re responding to this admin\u2019s harmful regulations. This is not a debt cancellation. It\u2019s a debt transfer. Once again, President Biden is pushing a misguided student loan scheme that will force taxpayers to foot the bill for loans they didn\u2019t take out. Great to join my fellow Nebraskans at Nebraska Breakfast this week. Enjoy your time in Washington! Since President Biden took office, prices have skyrocketed: Rent Groceries Natural Gas Electricity We need to end the Democrats\u2019 reckless spending that's squeezing family budgets across this country. EV\u2019s high voltage lithium-ion batteries pose risks to our first responders. \u201cI think we can feel great about our economy.\u201d \u2013Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen Americans know that isn\u2019t true. Overall prices have risen since President Biden took office, and families can feel it. Bidenomics isn't working. I worry that in its mission to push more EVs on consumers, this administration has been short-sighted on the safety concerns of this new technology. The admin's joint employer rule hurts local economies and disincentivizes entrepreneurs looking to franchise their businesses. Today, I voted to overturn this misguided rule and stand with America's small businesses. The Department of Defense\u2019s budget should meaningfully address the threats this country faces. President Biden\u2019s DoD budget proposal fails to do that, putting our national security at risk. President Biden\u2019s defense budget proposal fails to meaningfully address the rising threats we face from Russia and China. A increase in defense spending is not sufficient, especially when China has already announced plans to increase its defense budget by President Biden\u2019s costly student loan scheme forces American taxpayers to bear the burden of loans they didn\u2019t take out. That\u2019s wrong. Our nation is on the cusp of having not one, but two nuclear peer adversaries in Russia and China. In order to have a safe, reliable, effective, and credible nuclear deterrent into the and beyond, we need to start laying the groundwork for significant changes now. I recommended Judge Susan Bazis to the White House because of her skill, expertise, & integrity. Her record speaks for itself, with decades of experience administering justice, upholding the law, and defending our Constitution. The Senate did the right thing by confirming her. I have no doubt that she will continue to serve our state well. Judge Bazis! On Gold Star Spouses Day, we honor the husbands and wives of our service members who gave their lives in the defense of our country. We are forever grateful for your service, sacrifice, and courage. Thousands of Nebraskans still struggle with reliable broadband access. I hosted for a roundtable discussion at the to speak with stakeholders across NE about maximizing new investments to close the digital divide \u2014 no matter where you live. ! What an exciting and well-deserved honor. The infrastructure law continues to deliver for Nebraska. Today\u2019s grants will support important projects to enhance the passenger experience and invest in key improvements. Infrastructure is a key responsibility of the federal government, and this funding is welcome news for the many Nebraskans who rely on our airports to stay connected. We owe so much to our veterans for their sacrifice to protect our country and defend our freedoms. Unfortunately, too many veterans have difficulty navigating the VA and identifying which divisions to contact. The VA\u2019s current main information line provides veterans with a single hub to access information about different VA contact centers. Our legislation will codify this resource to ensure veterans can maintain access to this critical tool and better connect with the resources available to them. First responders keep us safe, and a reliable communications system is essential for their critical work during emergencies. Great to visit the Cass County Center with to learn more about their Emergency Communications. Thank you for having us! The Pentagon has finally released a public version of its report on critical spectrum airwaves, a release I\u2019ve called for since last year. Modern equipment vital to our nation\u2019s defense, including aircraft and radar, requires access to the entirety of the lower band. To protect this country from adversaries like China, the DOD must retain that access. NTIA can no longer overlook the facts included in this report. As I\u2019ve said previously: we should not continue to see DOD only as the pot of spectrum gold at the end of the rainbow. Reliable internet is essential for Nebraskans to access telehealth opportunities. Enjoyed visiting Children's Physicians in Plattsmouth with to discuss how we can continue to support telehealth services. Met with to discuss ways we can continue to support Nebraska\u2019s producers. Thank you for stopping by! Wishing you and your family a blessed Easter! Today we honor our brave Vietnam veterans and their families for the sacrifices they made in service to their country. Thank you for your bravery, our nation is forever grateful. Chinese mining companies have flooded Afghanistan since President Biden withdrew our troops. These companies have developed a symbiotic relationship with anti-American Taliban leadership, and that relationship continues to grow. The EV supply chain feeds our adversaries. Met with members of the Nebraska Cooperative Council to discuss their tax priorities and the Farm Bill. Thanks for making the trip to Washington! Firefighters have been caught off guard by EVs erupting in flames. If fire damages EV battery cells, the battery can reignite even once the fire's been put out. One fire chief described an EV fire as a \u201ctrick candle\u201d \u2014 you never know when it will reflame. I\u2019m concerned by the Department of Education\u2019s continued delay in rolling out the simplified FAFSA. The admin must remedy this situation so that millions of students and their families have the time they need to make such a significant decision. It\u2019s critical for us to support our veterans and their families. Thank you, Department of Nebraska, for coming to Washington to discuss how we can continue standing with our veterans! Nebraska has an abundance of natural resources because of locally-driven conservation practices. I appreciate the Nebraska Association of Resource Districts' continued efforts to ensure future generations of Nebraskans can enjoy all our state has to offer! Electric vehicles are plagued with glitches. Why is the administration trying to speed up EV production when they\u2019re clearly not ready for primetime? Honored to speak at the grand opening of \u2019s new facility in York yesterday. I\u2019m proud that Nebraska continues to be a proving ground for biofuel research, innovation, and production. Nebraskans, if you must travel today, be safe and stay alert. Be sure to check for updates from on current road conditions. Great to meet with members of the Nebraska Credit Union League to discuss their legislative priorities. Thank you for making the trip to Washington! I met with Nebraskan Veterans of Foreign Wars members to discuss how we can continue to support our nation\u2019s heroes. Thank you for your continued service and commitment to our country! Agriculture is Nebraska\u2019s number one economic industry. I met with Governor Pillen to discuss how we can continue to support Nebraska\u2019s producers. What happens if you crash your EV and it catches on fire? Would you call the fire department or highway patrol? If so, you may be out of luck. EVs pose risks of electric shock and persistent reignition to first responders. Nebraskans are paying more per month just to afford basic expenses. That\u2019s Bidenomics at work. Great to meet with Nebraska members of to speak about ways to improve the quality of life for all Nebraskans! Thanks for making the trip to Washington! In Nebraska Agriculture ranked: in beef and veal exports in ethanol production in corn for grain to Nebraska\u2019s leading industry! Manufacturing EVs emits more carbon than gas vehicles, and studies have shown electric cars heighten overall emissions compared to hybrid cars. The EPA\u2019s new tailpipe emissions rule is political, not environmental. Precision ag innovations allow producers to be more efficient, but high costs and lack of connectivity create major barriers to entry. My Precision Ag Package helps producers adopt this technology. I will continue my efforts to make these solutions a part of the Farm Bill. Biden\u2019s EV pipedreams are creating nightmares for America\u2019s trucking industry. The EPA\u2019s recent regulations to electrify U.S. trucking fleets could cost taxpayers nearly trillion. It\u2019s time for the admin to put American\u2019s best interests before its radical climate agenda. in jobs in the state of Nebraska are tied to the agricultural industry. Proud to celebrate the industry that drives our state\u2019s economy during The administration should come clean about the dirty truth behind electric vehicles, including the EV record on environmental problems, safety risks, and human rights abuses. Read my op-ed: Mandating electric vehicles only exacerbates their serious environmental, safety, and human rights concerns. The EPA should take its hands off the wheel and allow the market to work its course. This admin is spearheading a reckless push toward an electric future with a host of negative consequences. Today's tailpipe emissions rule neglects environmental, safety, and performance issues in favor of political posturing. The Biden revised standard responds to a slowdown in sales as Americans realize not just the cost and unreliability of electric vehicles, but also the dirty truth behind this supposedly \u2018clean\u2019 technology. Continuing to force EVs on automakers and the public will only exacerbate their serious environmental, safety, and human rights concerns. Instead of delaying these standards, should abandon this attempt to appease climate activists and allow the market to take its course. More practical, market-driven changes\u2014like allowing the year-round sale of ethanol\u2014would help achieve environmental goals for America\u2019s vehicle fleet. Today\u2019s tailpipe emissions rule slows the original timeline for forcing EVs on America. EPA's responding to reality: Americans don\u2019t want them. Ford, General Motors, Mercedes, Volkswagen \u2014 they're all scaling back on EVs. EPA must follow & hit the brakes on its climate charade. California insists it's \u201cspeculative\u201d to assume EVs will remain heavier than gas cars. Public policy should reflect reality, not the baseless future dream of featherweight electric cars. What\u2019s speculative, obviously, is assuming with no evidence that their weight will change. The truth is that EVs aren\u2019t a magic bullet for the environment. They\u2019re underdeveloped and pose safety risks. And they create more problems than they solve, both at home and abroad. The way the administration and their activist friends paint EVs, you\u2019d think these cars are a time-tested environmental blessing. But behind the curtain of this climate crusade, there\u2019s a host of problems \u2014 problems the admin has tried to hide. Wishing both and men and women\u2019s basketball teams good luck in the NCAA March Madness Tournament! Every day, support for Paid Family and Medical Leave continues to grow. Now, Congress needs to act. My PFML tax credit is the only policy with a track record of passage in Congress, and it will deliver meaningful relief for families and caregivers. \u201cIt had to be somebody who\u2019d plow deep and straight and not cut corners\u2026\u201d \u2013 God Made A Farmer, Paul Harvey Today we celebrate Nebraska's farmers and ranchers who always go the extra mile to feed and fuel our world. Happy National Agriculture Day! Great to meet with Nebraskans from Close Up Student Foundation during their trip to Washington with . Nebraska\u2019s future is bright with future civic leaders like them at the helm. Enjoyed visiting with members of to talk about their priorities for the upcoming Farm Bill. My staff will host a Local Office Hours in Sarpy County tomorrow. Stop by if you need help navigating an issue with a federal agency or want to speak to a member of my staff in person! Congratulations on the well-deserved recognition! Great to join my fellow Nebraskans at another Nebraska Breakfast this week. Honored to be a part of continuing this longstanding tradition! As China ramps up its military spending, President Biden is pushing to slash ours. His budget request is essentially a budget cut once you factor in the damaging impact of inflation. It's time for the President to take our national defense seriously. Even now, with prison gang members coming into the United States, we have had no help from this administration in securing our border and protecting American citizens. Our border is wide open and everyone knows it, including our enemies. Biden\u2019s public refusal to secure the border earlier this week only encourages more illegal immigration. This project will better protect the local community from flooding like the catastrophic floods in It will not only reduce the risk of property damage and interruptions to normal base operations, but it will also protect over in recent and future investments at Offutt. I will continue pushing for projects like this that support communities across our state. Public safety is a core duty of any government\u2014one that President Biden has abandoned at our border. TikTok negatively influences an entire generation of young Americans, affecting how they act, think, and even vote. We would have never allowed the Soviet Union to have that sort of direct link to the American population. Met with Nebraskan members of and discussed how we can support Nebraska's firefighters. Thank you for the work you do to keep our communities safe! Congrats on the well-deserved accolade , good luck in the Big Ten Tournament this week! Go Big Red! President Biden claims his economic policy is working. Families facing sky high grocery bills aren\u2019t buying it. Every day, Bidenomics makes Americans poorer. Recently met with members of to discuss their Farm Bill priorities. Thank you for making the trip to Washington! My staff will host Local Office Hours in Keya Paha, Boyd, Holt, and Rock Counties tomorrow. Stop by if you need help navigating an issue with a federal agency or want to speak to a member of my staff in person! Nebraskans rely on broadband to stay connected to the world around them. Great to meet with @USTelecom and discuss ideas to expand rural broadband access. The President\u2019s budget calls for a new Federal Paid Family Leave Program\u2014while I appreciate the sentiment and gesture to working families, I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s all it may be. A new, nationwide, entitlement program is not the answer. Such a fruitless pursuit would leave too many families where they are today: without access to Paid Family Medical Leave. As the administration works with Congress on this issue, we must consider my PFML tax credit\u2014the only PFML policy with a track record of passage in Congress. .'s plan follows a pattern of ignoring serious concerns from the Department of Defense about management of our federal airwaves. These spectrum airwaves are vital to highly sensitive and unique defense systems that keep Americans safe. You simply cannot slap a price tag on relocating them. In many cases, the costs are astronomical, or the systems cannot be re-engineered to function effectively in different bands of spectrum. If NTIA continues to move forward on its current course, defense operations will be at risk and taxpayer dollars will be wasted. NTIA is at a pivotal moment and must consider our nation's spectrum needs more holistically. I am disappointed and deeply concerned that USPS is moving forward with plans to downgrade the North Platte Post Office. Transferring some operations to Denver risks cutting jobs and increasing delivery delays for Nebraskans. It is also especially difficult to understand how sending intra-Nebraska mail out of state would improve efficiency. The best decisions impacting our communities are made by the people who live and work there, not government bureaucrats. I will continue to fight against this misguided decision. I strongly encourage North Platte citizens to make their views and voices heard on this important topic. Local broadcasters entertain, inform, and provide their communities with crucial services. Great meeting with to discuss ways we can continue to support broadcasters in our state. President Biden can't have it both ways \u2014 he says no president has been a better friend to Israel, but he's still drawing \"red lines\" to cater to the far-left wing of his party. Where is the red line for Hamas and Iran? This package includes several top priorities for our state \u2014 including funding towards the construction of a new Agricultural Research Service facility at UNL, an expansion of the Heartland Expressway, and increased funding for Offutt Air Force Base and for airports across NE. The investments we make today will ensure that Nebraska is well positioned to seize the opportunities ahead. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to push for the critical, high-impact investments that will support families and business across our state. I remain deeply concerned about our ability to conduct operations in Afghanistan. We cannot lose sight of how 's Afghanistan withdrawal has impacted the effectiveness of our strategy in the Senator Britt did what the President was unable to do\u2014address the issues facing working Americans and offer honest, clear solutions. Congratulations on showing Americans a safe & strong future they can believe in. Tonight, President Biden painted an imaginary picture of America: an America where families\u2019 high grocery bills are the fault of businesses instead of inflation, and where the dreams of wealthy climate activists matter more than the reality facing working Americans.

The Houthis are a terror group that targets Americans and our allies Removing their again\u2014would send a signal of weakness to our adversaries and reward their murderous behavior. President Biden's persistent refusal to provide Ukrainians with the weapons and flexibility they need makes clear that he doesn't want Russia to lose this war. It's not surprising that President Biden wants to distract from inflation by attacking pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). But Republicans shouldn't go along with the attempted diversion. A good reminder that losing our deterrence jeopardizes our national security. Good news for investors, companies, workers, and the rule of law. Giving Ukraine the weapons needed to win will help end the war\u2014and end it faster. It's in our core interest. I'm grateful to the Economic Club of Minnesota for honoring me with the Bill Frenzel Champion of Free Trade award. Here's the interview I did with Mark Kennedy at the celebratory luncheon. Attacking PBMs won\u2019t solve President Biden\u2019s inflation problem. Here is why: DC friends \u2013 Join CEO Brian Armstrong and thought leaders to discuss how crypto moves America forward. March at Capital Turnaround. RSVP here. This is a good reminder: the Russian people are also suffering from Putin's brutal invasion. It's in our core interest to help Ukraine win and end this war. President Biden wants to raise the corporate tax rate by percentage points\u2014a tax hike. But corporations don't pay taxes. They collect them from people. If Biden gets his way, we'll all pay with higher prices, lower wages, and weaker returns for shareholders. Inflation remains high\u2014nearly twice the target rate of American families are still paying the cost of this hidden tax. Putting activists on public boards is an abuse of the shareholder process. It's unfortunate that President Biden's agencies are supporting this scheme that puts political activism ahead of shareholder value. Republicans in the House should pass the supplemental appropraitions bill for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. And President Biden should deliver the weapons needed for Ukraine to actually win. The SEC has no authority or expertise to set climate and energy policy for America. Forcing companies to report this data is putting politics ahead of the SEC's mission and expertise. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda is right: they also violated the Administrative Procedures Act during the North Korea's aggression is another example of the danger we face from losing deterrence. It's a mistake to reflexively oppose all mergers, which are an important part of a free market. The Biden policy is bad for consumers, it's bad for workers, and it's bad for the economy. Congress should provide military aid to Ukraine. But there are things President Biden could do in the meantime, including approving long-range missiles and seizing Russia's assets in the west. There's no excuse for inaction. Congratulations to Senator McConnell on an extraordinary career and an amazing and successful run as leader. This is bad news for investors. The SEC should follow the law, enforce the rules, and refrain from targeting an asset class disfavored by the Chairman. If President Biden had acted earlier and more forcefully\u2014as some of us urged him to for years\u2014he may have been able to deter Putin. President Biden promised \"devastating\" consequences if Alexei Navalny was killed. Unfortunately, Biden has been weak on follow through since day one. Will he finally now confiscate the billions worth of Russian assets held in the West? Unfortunately, taxpayers foot the bill for student loan \"forgiveness.\" This includes the vast majority of Americans who already paid off their loans, paid tuition out of pocket, or do not have post-secondary education nor enjoy the higher lifetime earnings associated with it. These officials are right. The Biden Administration should reverse this decision which will have a chilling impact on investments and harm our energy security. Come on. another term for inflation, was caused by reckless fiscal and monetary policies. The way to fight it is responsible monetary policies. And to stop spending trillions we don't have. This is a good example of the hidden tax of regulations: higher costs for families already dealing with inflation. Military aid to Ukraine is cheap compared to dealing with a Putin victory. If Putin wins in Ukraine he won't stop there, and our costs would be far higher. As Milton Friedman said, \u201cinflation is taxation without The latest data is a reminder that this problem is not over. Which country has stricter environmental standards for the production of natural gas\u2014Russia or America? Of course we do. Which means pushing natural gas production to Russia makes no sense. The continued attacks from the Houthis put Americans at risk, raise costs for families, and they show the danger of America squandering our ability to deter threats. It's a reminder: the cost of disengaging is high. A strong foreign policy is in our core interest. The ban on new LNG terminals benefits our adversaries and damages the environment. It can't be justified. Let's be honest: pausing approval of liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals is a sop to the far left of the Democratic Party. It's bad for the economy, it's bad for the environment, and it's bad for national security. Expanding Fannie and Freddie's loan limits means more risk for taxpayers and more distortion in the market. This is a bad idea. As policymakers consider intervening in the pharmacy benefits market, they should remember: Employers choose to hire pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) because they believe PBMs lower costs. Lower costs for employers means lower costs for workers. Ukraine has given us a clear lesson for Taiwan: it is cheaper and more effective to send military aid in advance to prevent an invasion than to dribble it out after the invasion has started. This is what happens when America squanders its ability to deter. This became inevitable as President Biden refused to hold Iran accountable for the countless attacks on American forces conducted by Iran\u2019s proxies. Three U.S. service members were killed in a drone attack on a base in northeast Jordan, U.S. Central Command said Sunday. These activists are trying to micromanage Exxon's business, in violation of SEC rules, to reduce shareholder value. This is political abuse of the shareholder proposal process and the SEC should not allow An important piece from Robert Zoellick on why the should transfer frozen Russian reserves to an escrow for Ukraine. It's lawful, it would complement our military support for Ukraine, and it's in our core interest to help Ukraine win this war. Whatever President Biden says, his actions have consistently proven his highest priority is to prevent Putin from losing this war. It's in our core interest to help the Ukrainians defend themselves, and Biden has repeatedly delayed this from happening. In case you missed it, I was on WTOP and talked about the consequences of undermining the free market in healthcare. If the government restricts how pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) do business, patients can expect fewer choices and higher costs. Good for the to repeal the NLRB's joint employer rule. This rule is a power grab, it hurts entrepreneurs and workers, and it would raise costs when inflation is already crushing working families. The NLRB should go back to the rule that followed the law and brought certainty to businesses. Helping the Ukrainians defend themselves is very much in America's interests. President Biden should agree to the border security measures so Congress can end the border crisis and deliver the weapons Ukraine needs to win. In case you missed it, I made the case in Townhall that Congress should stay out of the credit card industry. The Credit Card Competition Act purports to lower fees but in reality it would likely get rid of rewards points, jeopardize data security, and put your money at risk. The latest inflation data is a reminder: Americans are still paying a high price for reckless fiscal and monetary policies. I'm glad the SEC finally approved Bitcoin ETFs. This is good news for investors and financial innovation. But the Chairman's statement denigrating the entire crypto industry was a mistake. The SEC should follow the law, enforce the rules, and refrain from playing politics by attacking an asset class the Chairman happens not to like. Great news and long overdue. Bitcoin ETFs are finally open to investors. My recent piece in Townhall: Before Targeting PBMs, Republicans Should Consider the Unintended Consequences Here\u2019s a great innovation by Paradigm: Policy Lab | Paradigm Policy Robert Lighthizer, President Trump's trade rep, claims the trade deals of the led to economic ruin. He's wrong. I shared my review and counterpoints to his \"No Trade is Free\" with The Wall Street Journal. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia today upheld the rule of law and properly served American consumers by vacating the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d decision of the SEC denying Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its Bitcoin Trust to an ETF. For those of us who care about crypto, and think it\u2019s past time for Congress to act on it, take a look at the new Stand with Crypto alliance. I joined today to discuss the recent Fitch downgrade, a stark reminder that we are on an unsustainable fiscal path that must be addressed. Here is a common sense, thoughtful piece on stablecoin legislation by . I joined following last week's \"Ripple ruling\" to share my views on what it means for the cryptocurrency industry, American consumers, and where we go from here. Last week, I appeared on to discuss the Fed's June decision and my views on the current political climate as we head into the election cycle: The Fed tried to pull a fast one in their motion to dismiss Custodia Bank's important lawsuit against the Fed for its denial of Custodian's application for a Master Account. The Fed totally my provision from last year's NDAA. My language requires them to disclose their disposition of Master Account applications. As I explained in my amicus brief, disclosure is not the same thing as permission to deny. Fortunately, U.S. District Court of Wyoming Judge Skavdahl agreed with me and saw through the Fed's specious argument. The result: Custodia Bank will get its day in court. From this morning on : Hey, who\u2019s that guy running the SEC?! From yesterday's WSJ The Fed is statutorily required to enhance transparency in regards to master accounts after the passage of my legislation last year. Today, however, the Fed's interpretation of the statute is plainly at odds with its purpose. The Court should reject any arguments attempting to misread the language as opining on the substantive discretion of the Board or Reserve Banks over the requirements for, or granting of, master accounts. It's a really bad idea to systematically and permanently say in the U.S. all deposits are guaranteed by the government. That will lead to bad outcomes, like some version of socializing the banking system because some folks will insist on that. Why would that work? It won't. The really important lesson from SVB's collapse is just how dangerous it is to have extremely imprudent monetary policy. That's the source of this problem. I'll be joining in a few minutes to discuss Silicon Valley Bank. Tune in! Check out my conversation with about Silicon Valley Bank and the causes of its collapse. Tune in to at to hear and I discuss the situation with Silicon Valley Bank. The Silicon Valley Bank collapse and the broader banking problems are a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve's disastrous monetary policies. Second, the Fed's zero interest rate real interest rates\u2014forced banks to move out of the risk curve in search of yield. So they invested in longer duration bonds. Third, when the Fed finally realized how far behind it was in fighting inflation, it had to play catch up by raising rates at a record pace. That devastated the banks' bond portfolios that the Fed had indirectly created. Despite our challenges, I\u2019m extremely bullish on America. My optimism is easily justified by our history. America has always been able to survive and thrive. And America remains the greatest nation in the history of the world. Representing Pennsylvania in the United States Senate for these twelve years has been the greatest honor of my professional life. I will always be enormously grateful to the wonderful people of this great state for entrusting me with this awesome responsibility. Merry Christmas! May you have a safe, warm, and joyous holiday. Stablecoins are an exciting technological development that could transform money & payments. I hope this framework lays the groundwork for my colleagues to pass legislation next year safeguarding customer funds without inhibiting innovation. The has proposed an agreement with the EU that would use the threat of ultra-high tariffs on steel + aluminum to coerce countries into implementing left-wing climate policies. This is a massive overreach of executive authority. Not even the EPA has been delegated authority from Congress to regulate emissions\u2014the fact that USTR thinks it can use a \u201cnational security\u201d tariff statute to do so is plainly absurd. It is well past time for Congress to pass legislation to require congressional approval before a president of either party can hike tariffs\u2014which are taxes\u2014on Americans. Congress does a disservice to itself and the American people when it considers trillion in spending and hundreds of extraneous provisions compiled in one massive page bill\u2014all with little public transparency or opportunity to amend. But the legislation\u2019s reckless increase in domestic spending will only exacerbate inflation and make it more likely that future generations will inherit a magnitude of debt that can only be resolved through crisis. With my last vote as a member of this body, I could not in good conscience condone this irresponsible product nor the process that created it. To all those across Pennsylvania who are celebrating tonight, I wish you and your loved ones a Happy #Hanukkah filled with light and joy.

On this America day, let's honor the sacrifice service members and families make. After most of the year spent deliberating, I\u2019m proud to say the Senate has passed the bipartisan NDAA and put our service members first. We secured many wins for not only our military, but for Oklahomans as well. I look forward to signing this into law. Today, we look back on the years of protection the Bill of Rights has guaranteed to all Americans. During my time in the Senate, I have always stood for the rights and freedoms that our Constitution protects and defends.

Democrats have changed the definition of a recession in order to avoid one.

Giving more young people a viable path to pursue a career in aviation will further grow the contributions of aerospace & defense to OK\u2019s economy This scholarship is a testament to my priorities as a pilot. It has been an honor to have been a voice for pilots in Washington while working with @AOPA to address the needs of pilots and the entire general aviation Iran's regime has long targeted Americans, Israelis and Arabs for murder. Sadly, spent two years ignoring Iran's terrorism while offering the regime billions to return to a failed nuke agreement. Why is he only recognizing Iran\u2019s terrorism now? I\u2019m pleased that confirmed what I\u2019ve known from the start \u2013 the EPA\u2019s decision to punish small refineries was unjust and based on bad economics. I join and in calling on the EPA to stop punishing energy producers and start following the law. Only a military family truly knows the full sacrifice of having a loved one serve in the armed forces. To all military families, thank you for your service and dedication to our country. May we never forget your commitment to our nation. Happy Military Family Month! Many of our allies on the front lines with Russia give more aid to Ukraine pound-for-pound than the U.S. That's why we need to ramp up industrial capacity to refill our own weapons stocks, sell to allies to refill their own and sustain Ukraine victories. For nearly two years, offered Iran massive sanctions relief to re-enter the failed Iran nuclear deal, which ignores Iran's terrorism and drone program. That approach failed miserably \u2013 Iran is now helping Russia kill Ukrainians. Today we honor all the brave men and women who are deployed across the globe defending our freedom. Deployments are hard on families, and we do not take their sacrifice for granted. Thank you to everyone who deploys and the families that support them. It is no coincidence that the administration released a controversial memo today for a policy that would not go into effect until months from now and misses the point of what the military should be focused on: defense. I am disappointed that the Biden administration has chosen this particular moment in time to politicize the military. With President Biden\u2019s announcement yesterday, he has depleted our emergency oil reserves to a low. Instead of threatening our energy security by raiding our reserves, this administration should reverse its destructive, Green New Deal-inspired energy policies that have caused record-high gas prices. Happy birthday to the ! We sleep safely at night because Sailors have had the watch hours a day, days a week, for years. The U.S. Navy has and always will continue to keep sea lanes open and Americans safe. #HooyahNavy! I don\u2019t think there\u2019s two closer friends than and myself here in the Senate. I\u2019m proud to work on my last defense bill alongside him. We are now one step closer to getting the to the finish line and making sure our military is provided for. From My joint statement with as we open debate on the National Defense Authorization Act I'm incredibly humbled & honored to be selected as the Association of the U.S. Army Legislator of the Year alongside my good friend, . I'm also proud of our joint efforts to preserve, renew & expand provisions & support for the U.S. Army. We cannot continue to foot the outrageous bill for Democrats\u2019 war on American energy. We need to unleash American energy and bring down prices for Oklahoma families. Kay and I were extremely sad to hear the news of Bill Brewster\u2019s passing. Bill was not only a close friend, but a colleague of whom I will miss dearly. During our shared years in Congress, Bill understood what true bipartisanship meant and worked hard for Oklahomans throughout his time in the Oklahoma delegation. I don\u2019t remember one time that we were in disagreement with each other. But more importantly, we became close friends and remained so until the day of his passing\u2014we have lost a good Oklahoman and a great man today\u2026and a The border crisis that Biden has allowed hurts American citizens, hurts our law enforcement and it even hurts the ones who have been encouraged to take the dangerous and illegal journey to cross our border. I am saddened that my colleagues chose to pass a short-term funding bill today instead of the long-term deal we need. Instead of working on bipartisan solutions, Democrats have pushed far-left spending proposals that are full of poison pills. These are a non-starter for Republicans, which is why we find ourselves dealing with yet another short-term bill. We need legislation that provides certainty and increased funding for our military and I hope my colleagues across the aisle come to this realization soon. I couldn\u2019t agree more, . Once again, Pres. Biden showcases how out of touch he is with the needs of Americans. Over the last two years, fentanyl has flown across our southern border at record highs, fueling a drug overdose crisis in our nation. This started and grew because of the border crisis, yet President Biden still does not take action. Democrats have now increased the IRS budget by billion, a move that is clearly aimed at extracting more money out of hard-working Americans. Instead of targeting middle-class Americans, we should focus on turning the economy around so Americans can take home a better paycheck Today, we honor the families who have lost a loved one in the line of duty. To all Gold Star spouses and families, we will never take for granted the sacrifices you have made. The Biden student debt bailout encourages colleges to raise the cost of tuition, making it even harder for working Americans to get an education past high school, and only increasing the burden of student debt down the road. Since President Biden took office, Americans are paying more than they did before \u2013 thanks to Democrats\u2019 reckless decisions. Republicans are working to rein in spending and get our economy back on track. Congratulations to Edmond resident Sarah Tippit for receiving the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute\u2019s \u201cAngels in Adoption\u201d award! Sarah is a beautiful example of how adoption can bless you and those around you. Today, we are facing greater nuclear threats than at any time since the worst days of the Cold War \u2013 threats that are expected to become even worse in the coming years. And it's clear to me that we are not prepared for this reality. My colleague from Nebraska has it exactly right. Putin\u2019s attempts at nuclear blackmail over Ukraine threaten the international order and cannot be allowed to succeed. There\u2019s this little old document that no one reads anymore called the Constitution, and I think some of my colleagues should give it another read today. The Constitution tells us what Congress is supposed to be doing here, and that\u2019s national defense. There\u2019s really no time to waste when it comes to protecting our country. The Senate must consider the NDAA now. Yesterday, I urged Sen. Schumer and Democrats to take up this bill ASAP: . is wrong: Dems ended most blue-state COVID restrictions, but Americans still die of COVID daily. We need a \"Warp Speed to expedite work on pancoronavirus and intranasal vaccines: years ago today the became the fourth branch of the . Thank you to all the brave service men and women who have defended this country both in the air and on the ground! #AirForceBday Today commemorates the signing of the U.S. Constitution years ago. May we continue to protect and uphold it each day. On and every day, we honor those who were prisoners of war \u2013 the ones who returned and those who never came home. We continue to honor the commitment of \u201cno service member left behind.\u201d The A&D industry is committed to securing our nation, supporting our military and promoting the wellbeing of our citizens. Join me in recognizing aerospace & defense throughout National Aerospace Week. #AeroWeek Since Biden took office, inflation has risen to cost Oklahomans an extra on monthly household spending. The admin\u2019s celebration of \u201cinflation reduction\u201d is an insult to Americans who are struggling to pay bills due to Democrats\u2019 own missteps. There are two things we should be doing here in Congress: defending America and supporting our nation\u2019s infrastructure. I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation that would do just that The fact that Pres. Biden is touting the so-called \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d today as a win for the U.S. economy is further proof of how disconnected he is from the American people. Inflation remains at record highs & Oklahomans & Americans are suffering every day because of it. Our National Defense Strategy is not shy about the scope &scale of the threat from China, &the speed of their advances. There\u2019s no better example of that than space. In a decade, the U.S. has gone from the unquestioned leader in space to merely one of two peers in a competition. Violent crime spiked from Jan. to June of this year, in comparison to the same timeframe last year. Instead of working to address this problem, Democrats are focused on pursuing their far-left agenda that will only increase inflation and harm everyday Americans. Our law enforcement agencies need our support. Today, and always, we honor all of the men and women who lost their lives and the first responders and service members who continue to fight the global War on million illegal immigrants have crossed the border under President Biden, with already million illegal encounters taking place in \u2013 the highest ever for a fiscal year. Even former Obama officials are calling Biden\u2019s border crisis \u201cnot sustainable.\" The bipartisan is a necessary bill that equips our nation\u2019s military amid growing threats. can't wait until November to bring the NDAA to the Senate floor like last year - there's too many important national security amendments that need consideration now. The HEROs Act was designed to support our active duty military personnel, who \u201cput their lives on hold, leave their families, jobs, and postsecondary education in order to serve their country.\u201d In the middle of a military recruiting crisis, Biden is stretching this law beyond all recognition to provide benefits for wealthy Americans who never wore their nation\u2019s uniform. Biden\u2019s track record keeps proving that he is anti-worker - real wages have been down every month since his \"stimulus\" in early the average American\u2019s savings are significantly less than last year and their real disposable income is lower than when he first took office. Happy Labor Day to every hard-working Oklahoman! Our state could not run without you. This aid package is insufficient to provide the Ukrainians with what they need to win. The Biden admin is now explicitly arguing to provide Ukraine with less military aid than Congress gave them several months ago in a massive bipartisan vote. Congress will have to lead Simultaneously, the White House has done little to incentivize or enable NATO countries to contribute more. And the White House has used the Defense Production Act for just about everything except the production of munitions. It's clear that Congress will have a lot of work to do to improve a Ukraine aid package when we return. The American people deserve a military aid strategy that protects U.S. national interests by helping the Ukrainians end this war quickly. Today marks years since #WWII came to an end when Japan officially surrendered aboard the USS Missouri. We remember and honor the Greatest Generation - the multitude of brave soldiers whose service and sacrifice resulted in freedom for us and many others around the world. One year ago, the world saw firsthand the results of the Biden horrible political decisions play out in Afghanistan. We will continue to hold the Biden administration accountable for this tragedy, and we will get the answers the American people deserve. My statement with on the one-year anniversary of President Biden\u2019s disastrous withdrawal from President Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed was a singular, history-making success in the fight against Unfortunately, President Biden gutted this program. As new variants continue to arise, and I are asking to stand up an Operation Warp Speed Very special to see the U.S. Mint honor aviator Bessie Coleman and Oklahoman Maria Tallchief on the American Women Quarters! One year ago, ISIS-K terrorists attacked the Kabul airport, claiming the lives of U.S. service members. Today, we pray for the loved ones they left behind. We promise to these families that the sacrifice of their sons and daughters will never be forgotten.
