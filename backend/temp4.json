            "text": "A few days after former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley dropped out of the Republican presidential primary on March 6, veteran media executive and Haley backer Harry Sloan got a call from movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked Sloan to help President Joe Biden take on Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nSloan agreed to help raise money for Biden\u2019s reelection effort and try to reel in Republican-aligned business leaders to get behind the president, he told CNBC in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cPeople I know who are generally business Republicans, they\u2019re going to hear from me\u201d about helping Biden, Sloan said. The former chair of MGM said he has already reached out to some of the people in his Rolodex, and he plans to host a fundraiser for Biden later this year.\n\nSloan is among at least half a dozen former Haley bundlers who have decided to help Biden \u2014 and not Trump \u2014 since Haley ended her campaign, according to a source familiar with the effort, who was granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nA co-chair of the Biden campaign, Katzenberg has been trying to recruit wealthy Haley supporters into Biden\u2019s camp since at least February.\n\nBut now, with Haley formally out of the race, that effort has gone into overdrive.\n\nSloan and other Haley supporters have also heard from the Biden campaign\u2019s finance chair, Rufus Gifford, who said he belongs to a WhatsApp group called \u201cHaley Supporters for Biden.\u201d\n\nFor Biden\u2019s team, successfully snagging Republican former Haley donors would amount to a fundraising coup, bolstering the president\u2019s political operation while taking these potential donors off the field for Trump.\n\nThe effort to win over Haley donors also got a boost when Trump threatened to blacklist Haley donors.\n\n\u201cAnybody that makes a \u2018Contribution\u2019 to [Haley] from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don\u2019t want them, and will not accept them,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social on Jan. 24.\n\nHaley notably did not endorse Trump when she dropped out of the race.\n\nSloan himself is a major addition to Biden\u2019s fundraising arsenal. While Haley was still in the primary, Sloan helped to raise at least $550,000 for her White House bid, most of it through two fundraising receptions, including one at his home in Los Angeles.\n\nBut Sloan is not a straight party-line donor. He has donated in the past to candidates on both sides of the aisle, including $100,000 last year to a pro-Biden political action committee, Future Forward, and a separate donation to Biden\u2019s campaign.\n\nSloan also gave $100,000 to a PAC that supported Haley, according to Federal Election Commission records. Another Republican who received a donation from Sloan is Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick.\n\nThe never Trump wing\n\nBarbara Comstock, a former Virginia Republican congresswoman who was co-chair of Haley\u2019s campaign, is also working against the Trump candidacy.\n\n\u201cI support the Republican Voters Against Trump efforts. I also support Republicans for Ukraine,\u201d Comstock told CNBC in an email. \u201cStill figuring out what other things would be most helpful.\u201d\n\nComstock said that if she chooses to include fundraising in her efforts, Republican Voters Against Trump does operate through a super PAC called Republican Accountability.\n\nThe super PAC recently announced plans to launch a $50 million general election effort to defeat Trump.\n\nThe project will feature videos of former Trump voters explaining why they won\u2019t back him again in 2024. The clips and quotes will appear on television, radio, billboard and digital ads targeting voters in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe super PAC is largely funded by anti-Trump donors. LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman contributed $4 million last year to the group, according to campaign finance records. Hoffman also donated $250,000 to a pro-Haley PAC.\n\nHoffman has donated at least $2 million more to the Republican Accountability PAC so far this year, his political advisor Dmitri Mehlhorn told CNBC.\n\nRepublican Accountability also received $2 million in 2023 from Defending Democracy Together, a political nonprofit led by Bill Kristol, an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s and a former aide in the Reagan administration.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

            "text": "Four years after the Covid pandemic sent America into a standstill, President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is looking to co-opt a common question posed by former President Donald Trump and his allies: \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d\n\nTrump asked his 6.7 million followers on Truth Social that question earlier this week, using it to drive contrasts between Biden and Trump\u2019s records on the economy and the border. But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time, and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the crisis.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, \u2018Are you better off today than you were yesterday?\u2019 Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and his allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt cited higher mortgage rates, illegal border crossings, the war in Ukraine and other foreign conflicts to argue the U.S. was better off under Trump prior to Covid-19.\n\n\u201cAmericans know Biden has been a disaster and they were far better off under President Trump, which is why President Trump continues to crush Biden in the polls,\u201d Leavitt said.",

            "text": "Today, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled, \u201cInfluence Peddling: Examining Joe Biden\u2019s Abuse of Public Office.\u201d Witnesses included Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis who testified that Joe Biden knew about, participated in, and enabled his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes that made his family over $24 million. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (CO-03) said, \u201cJoe Biden has leveraged his elected position to enable the Biden family, their business associates, and their shell companies to receive over $24 million dollars from China and other entities. Biden is compromised and a threat to our national security. It is far past time Congress evict the resident in the White House and hold him accountable for selling out the American people.\u201d Background Courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability: Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis testified under oath President Joe Biden actively participated in his family\u2019s corrupt business dealings and acted as the closer for deals with Chinese and Russian entities. Mr. Tony Bobulinski, Biden family business associate: \u201cJoe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business; he was an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\u201d Mr. Jason Galanis, Biden family business associate: \u201cDuring the May 4th party, we were told to go to an area of the restaurant to gather because Hunter was going to call his father. Hunter called his father, said hello and \u2018hold on, Pops,\u2019 then put the call on speakerphone and said, \u2018I am here with our friends I told you were coming to town, and we wanted to say hello.\u2019 The Vice President said hello and some pleasantries [\u2026] and then seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, \u2018Ok then, you be good to my boy.\u2019 Hunter responded by saying, \u2018Everything is good, and we are moving ahead.\u2019 The Vice President said something about \u2018being helpful,\u2019 and Hunter ended the call by saying that he was going to call his father later. [\u2026] A few days after this May 4th party, an email my lawyer provided to this committee shows that Devon had confirmed Ms. Baturina was committed to a \u2018hard order\u2019 of $10-20 million in a Burnham investment banking client.\u201d The Bidens don\u2019t sell a product or a service or a set of skills. President Joe Biden is \u201cthe brand\u201d that the Biden family is selling for millions of dollars to those around the world willing to pay for it. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cI want to be crystal clear: from my direct personal experience and what I have subsequently come to learn, it is clear to me that Joe Biden was \u2018the Brand\u2019 being sold by the Biden family. His family\u2019s foreign influence peddling operation \u2013 from China to Ukraine and elsewhere \u2013 sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the United States government. Mr. Jason Galanis: \u201cThe entire value-add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.): \u201cThe scam is simple. It\u2019s done over and over again. The Biden family promises Joe\u2019s power, Joe Biden shows up, and millions of dollars come into the Bidens\u2019 pockets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio): \u201cMillions of dollars from foreign entities run through twenty different companies, for what? Devon Archer told us what it was for: Access to the brand. And the brand was Joe Biden. The brand that played rounds of golf, took calls and meetings, attended lunches and dinners with Hunter Biden and his business partners.\u201d Hunter Biden failed to appear alongside his business associates today because his testimony would not withstand public scrutiny when held up against witness facts and evidence uncovered showing Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in the business schemes. Hunter for months has requested a public hearing, but when offered one alongside his business associates, he failed to show up. Mr. Bobulinski: \u201cHow are the American people supposed to get the unvarnished facts and truth when the son and brother of Joe Biden are willing to perjure themselves to protect the family?\u201d President Joe Biden continues to lie directly to the American people about the central role he played in his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cWhy is Joe Biden blatantly lying to the American people? Why has he not simply leveled with the American people about all of the meetings, phone calls, emails and handshakes he has had with the Biden family\u2019s U.S. and foreign business partners, including players from some of America\u2019s most challenging adversaries such as China and Russia, as well as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania and others. If he were doing nothing wrong, why go through this insane exercise of obstructing and denying obvious facts?\u201d The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability released a video exposing Joe Biden\u2019s repeated lies about his family\u2019s influence peddling business. The video uses new footage from recent transcribed interviews with key witnesses who testified today. ###",

            "text": "A recent development in the highly contentious Georgia 2020 election interference case has granted former President Donald Trump and other defendants the right to appeal a decision that would allow Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the prosecution team. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee\u2019s determination opens the door for the defense to seek review from the Georgia Court of Appeals regarding whether Willis should be disqualified because of her romantic relationship with a special prosecutor on the case, Nathan Wade.\n\nThe backstory of this legal entanglement is rooted in the accusations against Trump and 18 others of attempting to unlawfully overturn his slim defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 Georgia presidential election. A recorded phone call from January 2, 2021, exemplifies the charges, capturing Trump pressing Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to secure his victory.\n\nWhile Judge McAfee ruled that Willis could maintain her prosecutorial position given Wade\u2019s resignation, which took effect last Friday, the defense claims that Willis\u2019s continuation presents an impermissible appearance of impropriety that could jeopardize any future convictions. Trump\u2019s attorney, Steve Sadow, underscored the gravity of the judge\u2019s consent to appeal, stating, \u201cThe defense is optimistic that appellate review will lead to the case being dismissed and the DA being disqualified.\u201d Despite these proceedings, the trial preparations move forward, as Judge McAfee indicated he would continue addressing other pending matters.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense teams have accused Willis of financial impropriety, alleging she paid Wade substantial sums for his work on the case, then benefited personally when he spent part of those earnings on vacations for them both. Both Willis and Wade deny any wrongdoing, asserting their romantic involvement began only after Wade\u2019s appointment as special prosecutor and concluded in the summer of 2023. Following the controversy, Wade tendered his resignation to expedite the case, an act Willis commended for its dedication to the American public and the democratic process.\n\nThe former president, who has entered a not guilty plea and vehemently denied any misconduct, sees the litany of cases against him as a concerted effort to undermine his potential 2024 presidential campaign. As Trump and his associates seek to challenge McAfee\u2019s ruling in a higher court, they contend that the disclosed romantic relationship undermines the integrity of the prosecution, requiring Willis\u2019s dismissal or at least the disqualification of her entire office.\n\nThe stakes of the appellate decision are substantial, affecting the defendants\u2019 due process rights and potentially requiring retrials should errors be identified later. With the defense\u2019s motion for appeal highlighting the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d and \u201codor of mendacity\u201d referenced by McAfee, the legal battle promises to persist as a pivotal and polarizing episode in the larger narrative of the 2020 election aftermath.\n\nRelevant articles:\n\n\u2013 Judge clears way for Trump to appeal ruling keeping Fani Willis on Georgia 2020 election case\n\n\u2013 Judge allows Trump and co-defendants to appeal order letting Fani Willis continue on 2020 election case, CNN, Wed, 20 Mar 2024 15:57:00 GMT\n\n\u2013 Georgia judge allows Trump to appeal Fani Willis disqualification ruling, The Hill, Wed, 20 Mar 2024 16:11:00 GMT\n\n\u2013 Judge grants Trump request to appeal decision to keep Fani Willis on Georgia case, The Washington Post, Wed, 20 Mar 2024 20:02:00 GMT\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

            "text": "The Biden administration faces increasing backlash over new legislation that will re-classify gig workers as employees.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s (DOL) new Independent Contractor Rule can into effect on March 11. It imposes six criteria that employers must consider when deeming whether to classify a worker as an independent \u2018gig\u2019 contractor or an employee.\n\nThe new rule makes it more difficult for employers to classify workers as independent contractors, which is likely to have a significant impact on industries that rely heavily on gig workers, such as ride hailing, food delivery and creative services.\n\nAccording to Statista data, as of February 2024 there were 76.4 million freelance workers in the US. Turning a sizeable amount of the millions on independent contractors into unionized employees would help President Joe Biden achieve his promise of being \u201cthe most pro-union president in American history.\u201d\n\nBut the new law has been criticized by gig workers, small business advocates, trade groups, and lawmakers. They liken it to the controversial rule in California, which governs gig work and that came into effect on January 1, 2020. The law, known was Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), require many businesses to treat gig workers as employees.\n\nUnder the rule, the number of articles freelance journalists can be paid for are capped. However, following an outcry by gig workers, the legislature in California passed over 100 exemptions for industries that were being impacted by the law.\n\nAt least five lawsuits have been filed against the Biden administration to stop the new Independent Contactor Rule. The US Chamber of Commerce is one of the latest groups challenging the law.\n\nBut the DOL argues that the legislation helps protects workers\u2019 rights and offers more consistency through the Fair Labor Standards Act. More Perfect Union, the union-friendly organization, support the rule, arguing that the forthcoming legislation will result in higher wages and overtime pay for millions of workers in gig jobs.\n\nHowever, workers continue to prioritize the flexibility and autonomy that contracted employment models provide, as a Harvard Business Review study found.\n\nKaren Anderson, founder of the Freelancers Against AB5, described the rule as \u2018disruptive and cruel.\u2019\n\n\u201cWithin our membership, we\u2019ve identified more than 600 categories of professions affected by this destructive, disruptive and cruel law,\u201d she said.",

            "text": "The economic toll of inflation rates in the U.S. remains a top issue for voters in the 2024 presidential cycle.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, nearly three-quarters of Americans say strengthening the economy is their top priority, driven by worries about inflation. 72% of adults are very concerned about the price of food and consumer goods and 63% are very worried about the cost of housing.\n\nDespite inflation having fallen by about 6 percent since its high in 2022 and the U.S. enjoying the lowest inflation among countries in the G7, an informal group of advanced economies including Germany, Japan and the U.K.\n\nThe tide might be starting to turn as views on the economy shift: a Suffolk University and USA TODAY poll shows that 33 percent of respondents describe the economy as being in \u201ceconomic recovery,\u201d up from 9 percent less than two years ago.\n\nWith voters so concerned about inflation and the economy, they will likely consider President Joe Biden\u2019s and former President Donald Trump\u2019s inflation-reducing plans when making their decision.\n\nHow does Biden plan to fix inflation?\n\nBiden has touted his Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in August of 2022, but it hasn\u2019t yet curbed prices\u2014which even he admits.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t called it that because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it has to do with providing alternatives that generate economic growth,\u201d the president said in August 2023.\n\nHowever, the law also hasn\u2019t caused prices to increase, and it has the potential to bring down inflation in the future. By 2030, the White House says it will cut electricity rates by as much as 9 percent through tax credits for renewable energy, and lower gas prices by as much as 13 percent through electric vehicle tax credits.\n\nThe law could also bring down inflation through its health care provisions, which include capping monthly insulin prices and out-of-pocket prescription drugs.\n\nBiden has pledged to do more on inflation. In a statement on March 12, he said that his recent budget proposal would lower prescription drug costs, health care, child care, and education costs, rents by building two million homes, and taxes on the wealthy and corporations. However, the proposal is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled House.\n\nMore:Taxing the rich to cut deficit: Five takeaways from President Biden's proposed budget\n\nWhere does Trump stand on fixing inflation?\n\nTrump voters have mentioned inflation and the economy as reasons for voting for the former president. However, according to economists, his agenda includes few inflation-reducing policies.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s plans to curb inflation would be more gas production. He said that America should \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d But America is already drilling: U.S. oil output hit record highs last year.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s plans is to increase tariffs on goods from China by as much as 60 percent or more. But these tariffs wouldn\u2019t just hurt foreign producers; costs could be passed onto the goods themselves, raising prices for consumers.\n\nThe campaign also promises a large-scale deportation of undocumented immigrants. If that plan were implemented, labor shortages would raise prices because of either fewer goods or raised wages.\n\nTrump has also mentioned his intent to deregulate businesses, which could reduce inflation as businesses save costs. But he has not offered any more details on those plans.\n\nOther factors that lower inflation\n\nThe president often gets celebrated when the economy is doing well, and blamed when it\u2019s doing poorly. But the reality is that the administration usually has little control over how the economy performs.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s not just the White House that controls inflation; in reality, the Federal Reserve is the agency mainly responsible, and makes decisions independent of the president. To keep inflation low, the Fed\u2019s principal tool is raising interest rates. However, higher interest rates can make home ownership more expensive.\n\nOil and gas prices have a significant impact on inflation. Recently, their rise and fall have been tied to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In general, oil prices are driven by global events rather than U.S. domestic policy.\n\nThe pandemic is also to blame. Supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic increased shipping costs, which in turn increased the prices of goods. As those kinks have been worked out recently, prices have fallen.\n\nInflation is receding: while not yet at the 2% recommended by the Federal Reserve, it\u2019s at 3.1 percent right now\u2014much lower than 9.1 percent in 2022.\n\nYet, high prices remain fresh in voters\u2019 minds, and both Biden and Trump will likely want to prove themselves the best candidates for the job.",

Wednesday in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\u201cDonald, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help you,\u201d Biden said, drawing laughter and applause from supporters.\n\nBiden\u2019s financial advantage could help soothe Democratic nerves as the nation\u2019s oldest president suffers record-low approval ratings less than seven months into his rematch with Trump.\n\nDocuments filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday showed that the Biden campaign had $71 million in cash on hand as of the end of February, more than double Trump\u2019s $33.5 million in cash.\n\nIn February alone, the current president\u2019s campaign raised $21.3 million, nearly double Trump\u2019s $10.9 million. Meanwhile, Biden spent $6.3 million that month, but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nHowever, the numbers don\u2019t give a complete picture of any individual candidate, as documents from their various fundraising committees aren\u2019t due until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said over the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, for a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most money raised by a Democratic Party at this stage of the election cycle.\n\n-\u201cDumpster Fire\u201d-\n\nPerhaps Trump\u2019s most worrying factor is his massive legal bills as he faces criminal cases, including ones seeking to overturn his 2020 election defeat and keep secret documents.\n\nLegal fees accounted for a whopping $5.6 million of Trump\u2019s Save America PAC\u2019s expenses in February \u2014 money that could have been spent on campaign events and television ads.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he works to raise $464 million in bonds to appeal a fine imposed by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces asset seizure, a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump has called the fraud a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and, as usual, is trying to use the legal cases against him to inflame his supporters and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on one million Trump-supporting patriots to say: Stop the witch hunt against President Trump!\u201d Wednesday\u2019s campaign message said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKeep your dirty hands away from Trump Tower,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk of a court case.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump successfully raised a separate bond of $91.6 million as he appealed sexual assault and defamation convictions in a lawsuit filed by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign described Trump\u2019s finances as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s documents paint a bleak picture for the Republican Party,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Amal Moussa wrote Thursday.\n\nBut as the election approaches and Trump leads Biden in key battleground states in recent polls, Democrats will try to keep their war chest as deep as possible.\n\nBiden will join Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at a fundraiser in New York on March 28, the first such event to feature three Democratic presidents. One of the most profitable events in the party\u2019s history.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the gala will raise $10 million for Biden\u2019s campaign, and guests will have to pay $100,000 each to take photos with the 42nd, 44th and 46th President of the United States.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Smith is prosecuting Trump in two separate federal cases, one involving Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and one involving his alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Both cases are still ongoing.\n\nTrump still faces charges in classified documents, election interference cases\n\nThe federal judges responsible have not brought an end to the two criminal cases brought against Trump as a result of Smith's investigations.\n\nTrump faces 40 counts in the classified documents case, including charges of obstructing justice, making false statements and trying to \"alter, destroy, mutilate or conceal evidence.\" More than 300 classified documents were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, over a year after he left the White House\n\nJudge Eileen Cannon is expected to postpone a May 20 trial date because of disputes in the case, and she has said it will probably be later than the prosecution's proposal of July 8. Trump\u2019s lawyers suggested Aug. 12, but also urged Cannon to postpone the trial until after the November election.\n\nFact check: Biden had nothing to do with Trump's indictment in classified documents probe\n\nTrump faces another four counts in the election interference case \u2013 three for conspiracy and one for obstruction. He is accused of falsely claiming election fraud and trying to overturn the legitimate 2020 election results.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan canceled a March 4 trial date as higher courts weigh Trump's claim that a former president is immune from prosecution for official acts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal and scheduled arguments for the week of April 22.\n\nIn the first comment, the social media user who made the post shared a link to an article published in January about Chutkan barring Smith from filing pretrial motions without permission as Trump's immunity claim is decided.

And instead of jumping the gun, it can sometimes help to pause, take a deep breath, and reexamine things a few days later.\n\nJust last week, President Joe Biden reached out to farmers and the rural community when his administration released the \u201cBillion Ton Report,\u201d announcing increased biomass production. This move will triple overall generation, advance sustainable aviation fuel, help tackle the climate crisis, and encourage the agriculture industry. Energy Secretary Granholm said this plan will take advantage of winter oilseed crops, microalgae from ocean farming, corn grain/ethanol, and carbon dioxide generated at industrial plants.\n\nAnd earlier this month, President Biden delivered a strong and energetic \u201cState of the Union\u201d speech, detailing issues important to the nation and to us here in Virginia and Amelia County. He explained how his administration has focused on growing our economy, promoting jobs, and ensuring that school teachers do not pay higher tax rates than billionaires and Fortune 500 corporations.\n\nPresident Biden has also emphasized strengthening women\u2019s rights and protecting our environment. His actions have reduced air pollution, promoted more clean energy initiatives, and ensured that family farms can stay in the family. He has strengthened worker union rights, built more roads and bridges, and constructed state-of-theart electric vehicle charging stations and broadband connections here in Virginia.\n\nPresident Biden has displayed a clear command of the issues facing our nation, our state, and our county.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStuart V.

            "text": "President Biden\u2019s reelection campaign is eyeing North Carolina as a state to flip in 2024, a place where former President Trump barely eked out a win the last time the two went head-to-head.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign acknowledges it will \u201ctake relentless effort\u201d to reach every voter it can by November, the Tar Heel State is seen as an opportunity, especially given a gubernatorial race that could boost Biden.\n\nBut strategists question how feasible that goal is, given the state hasn\u2019t gone to a Democrat since 2008 and went to Trump in his last two White House bids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still aspirational, but the state is definitely in play,\u201d said GOP strategist Doug Heye. \u201cTrump should win it. If I were betting on it, I would bet Trump would win.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina is part of the Biden campaign\u2019s pathway-to-270 strategy through critical swing states, which include the so-called blue wall made up of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; western battlegrounds including Nevada and Arizona; and southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina is included as part of a $30 million six-week advertising blitz the campaign announced after the State of the Union address to spend big in battleground states. Biden recently did radio interviews around Super Tuesday in Fayetteville and Charlotte to reach Black North Carolinians, one of several voting factions key to another victory.\n\nBiden and Vice President Harris will travel to North Carolina on March 26 as part of their effort to travel to every battleground state in March.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians know that while President Biden is fighting for us, Donald Trump is fighting for billionaires, corporations, and an extreme agenda that hurts our families and our economy,\u201d Biden campaign\u2019s North Carolina communications director Dory MacMillan told The Hill. \u201cOur campaign will continue to communicate across every corner of this state to reject Trump\u2019s attacks on our families and earn four more years of progress with President Biden.\u201d\n\nThe campaign currently has a $155 million war chest, but aside from spending and infrastructure, a major factor that strategists say can help Biden in the Tar Heel State is the governor\u2019s race, which includes far-right Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson on the ballot.\n\n\u201cGiven the very weak Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina and a very sophisticated operation from the Democratic candidate, the Biden team will have an even better opportunity to win there this time around because of the demographic shifts and a robust coordinated campaign in a state he barely lost,\u201d said Michael LaRosa, first lady Jill Biden\u2019s traveling press secretary during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMike Lonergan, the communications director for Mark Robinson for Governor, criticized Biden and Robinson\u2019s Democratic opponent Josh Stein in a statement to The Hill, saying Stein \u201cstands with President Biden\u2019s open-borders policies and would turn North Carolina into a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants; and he\u2019s backed by far-left radicals that want to defund the police.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cThe Democrats will stop at nothing to smear Mark Robinson because they know North Carolina voters have had enough of extremism and lies from career politicians like Joe Biden and Josh Stein.\u201d\n\nTrump barely beat Biden in North Carolina last time around by less than 1 percentage point. The last Democrat to win the state in a presidential contest was then-Democratic nominee Barack Obama, but he lost his reelection bid there to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by 2 percentage points. Trump won the state when he ran for the White House the first time in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points.\n\nAn aggregation of polls shows Trump with a 7.4 point lead over Biden in North Carolina, a wider lead than the former president has managed in other battleground states.\n\n2024 could prove to be a split-ticket situation in North Carolina, where Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Stein wins while Trump takes the state, considering that when Trump won the state in 2020, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was reelected to a second term.\n\nThe GOP nominee for superintendent, who would oversee the public schools in North Carolina, is also troubling to some moderate Republicans. Social media posts have emerged of Michele Morrow calling for former President Obama to be publicly executed, CNN reported.\n\nGiven the slate of Republican candidates, Democrats believe pouring efforts into North Carolina is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart bet,\u201d said Ivan Zapien, former official at the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Republicans have nominated some down-ballot candidates that are not going to do well in the suburbs, assuming the suburbs perform like they have been performing [in] the last cycles. It\u2019s ripe for a pickup.\u201d\n\nStill, Democrats acknowledge it\u2019s an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is ripe to flip, but it\u2019s still North Carolina,\u201d LaRosa said.\n\nRepublicans like Heye, a North Carolina native, say the state\u2019s not a forgone conclusion given its demographic developments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an outside chance that the Democrats take it because of the closeness of the state, because of the fast growth in the state, particularly in two parts \u2014 Charlotte and Raleigh and their suburban areas,\u201d he said.\n\nGrowth in areas like Charlotte and Raleigh has comprised an uptick in young, professional, suburban women, who helped give Democrats better-than-expected results in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nBlack voters are also a pivotal voting bloc in North Carolina, which is home to 11 historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nJim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, compared North Carolina to Georgia, a state that helped push Biden over the edge in 2020 in large part because of support from Black voters.\n\n\u201cThey each have a growing share of college-educated voters that have become essential for Democrats. Georgia has more African American voters, which proved to be the difference in 2020, but North Carolina is starting to look like the kind of state where Democrats should prevail,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was updated at 8:57 p.m.\n\nFOLLOW US ON GOOGLE NEWS\n\nRead original article here",

But there was no, like, reaction.\u201d\n\nThe woman who was killed, Ashli Babbitt, has become a martyr to the Trumpist far right. Trump has called her a \u201cgreat patriot\u201d. The police officer who shot her outside the House chamber was cleared of wrongdoing, a judgment with which Trump disagreed.\n\nEight other deaths, including law enforcement suicides, are now linked to the Capitol attack, which happened after Trump told supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to overturn Biden\u2019s win, which according to Trump\u2019s lie was the result of electoral fraud.\n\nMore than 1,200 arrests have been made over the riot and hundreds of convictions and sentences secured. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted by Senate Republicans. He is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president, despite facing 88 criminal charges (14 concerning election subversion) and multimillion-dollar penalties in civil lawsuits. The US supreme court rejected attempts to keep Trump off the ballot under the 14th amendment to the constitution, which bars insurrectionists from office.\n\nThe Times said it obtained the redacted transcript of the valet\u2019s testimony from House Republicans who claim the January 6 committee omitted from its hearings and report anything that did not suit its narrative.\n\nTranscripts contradicting sensational testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a close aide to Trump\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, have already been released.\n\nBarry Loudermilk of Georgia, the Republican leading the effort to undermine the work of the January 6 committee, told the Times there was \u201csome testimony in [the valet transcript] that may not be favorable to Trump\u201d but said: \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all out there, not doing what the select committee did, and putting things out there that will be favorable to our side.\u201d\n\nBennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chaired the January 6 committee, which included two anti-Trump Republicans, told the Times: \u201cDespite Mr Loudermilk\u2019s attempts to rewrite the violent history of January 6, the facts laid out in the select committee\u2019s final report remain undisputed \u2013 and nothing substantive was left out nor hidden.\n\n\u201cWhile the valet did not witness everything that happened in the White House that day, the testimony confirms Trump\u2019s indifference to the violence and his anger at Vice-President Pence for performing his duty under the constitution.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed valet said he did not remember Trump calling Pence what the Times called \u201can expletive meant to refer to a wimp\u201d, otherwise widely reported to have been the word \u201cpussy\u201d.\n\nAs the Times noted, Trump has not disputed the insult that was described to the January 6 committee by a former chief of staff to Ivanka Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe valet also said he did not remember Trump or any staff member commenting on how rioters chanted for Pence to be hanged. Hutchinson told the committee she heard aides saying Trump said Pence \u201cdeserved\u201d such a fate.\n\nThe valet said he heard Trump ask aides about how to send national guard troops to the Capitol, a deployment that took several hours as chaos reigned and a contentious issue since.\n\nThe valet also described \u201cdisbelief\u201d among White House staff as the situation at the Capitol worsened and Trump persisted in watching TV.\n\nPence escaped the rioters and ultimately returned to the Capitol to preside over certification, despite objections from 147 Republicans in the House and Senate. According to Trump\u2019s valet, the president \u201cjust mentioned that Mike let him down, and that was it\u201d.\n\nTrump has been proved right, however, about Pence committing a \u201cpolitical career killer\u201d. Portrayed as a hero by the January 6 committee, Pence ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Failing to make an impact, he withdrew well before the first primary vote.\n\nLast week, he exacted a measure of revenge \u2013 by refusing to endorse Trump in his rematch with Biden.\n\nBut Pence also said his differences with Trump were \u201cnot personal\u201d \u2013 and refused to say he would not vote for him.",

(Brian Fluharty/Getty Images)\n\n(DALLAS) \u2014 Billionaire businessman Mark Cuban, who voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the 2024 GOP primary and is now supporting President Joe Biden, attended the president\u2019s second fundraiser in Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday night.\n\nBiden\u2019s appearance Wednesday night with Cuban, the former majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is part of the president\u2019s larger effort to court donors and supporters of Nikki Haley following her exit from the race.\n\nCuban is one of the main sharks of the ABC reality television series Shark Tank and will exit the show in 2025.\n\nHe confirmed his attendance late Wednesday night, telling ABC News he \u201cwanted to show my support and say hi to the President.\u201d\n\nAt the fundraiser in the backyard of a sprawling home in a wealthy Dallas neighborhood, Biden dug into his differences with former President Donald Trump and asked the iconic question coined by Ronald Reagan: \u201cAre you better off now than four years ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me ask you \u2013 does anyone here want to go back to 2020? When fear ruled our lives and Trump was president? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Biden said, calling on \u201cDemocrats, independents and Republicans,\u201d to join together to defeat Trump once again.\n\nA source familiar told ABC News the Biden campaign has also been hosting Zoom calls with former donors of Haley since she suspended her campaign on March 6.\n\nCuban, who says he cast his ballot in Texas for Haley, told Bloomberg earlier this month that he would vote for Biden over Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s re-election campaign has said they are confident they\u2019ll be able to persuade Haley supporters who oppose a second Trump term to cross party lines and back the president in the fall.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump made it clear he doesn\u2019t want Nikki Haley\u2019s supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,\u201d Biden said in a statement minutes after Haley suspended her presidential campaign.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign has pointed to Haley still receiving a sizable share of votes in primary elections even after she dropped out of the race to argue Trump will have trouble uniting Republicans in November.\n\n\u201cNikki Haley is describing to the world exactly where and with whom Donald Trump is weak, and our campaign is paying attention to that and will be engaging voters very intentionally, to draw that contrast and invite them in,\u201d a campaign aide said on a press call Monday.\n\nAides point to exit polling as well to show there are Republican primary voters who say they would support Biden in the general election. In Ohio, for instance, as reported by ABC News, exit polling Tuesday found eight in 10 Haley supporters said they wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump in the general, with nearly half saying they\u2019d back Biden \u2014 a figure the Biden campaign blasted to reporters.\n\nAt least half a dozen former Haley bundlers have opted to help Biden\u2019s campaign rather than Trump\u2019s, according to reporting from CNBC that was distributed to reporters on Tuesday by Biden\u2019s team. Veteran media executive and former Haley donor Harry Sloan was one of those donors recruited to help reelect Biden and raise money for his campaign.\n\nCuban visited the White House earlier this month for a roundtable on lowering prescription drug costs, something Cuban is passionate about \u2014 he started Cost Plus Drug Company, which provides medication at low costs to consumers. Biden has touted his own efforts to tackle the high costs of prescription drugs \u2014 namely capping the cost of insulin at $35 for seniors.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024, ABC Audio.

            "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Biden campaign released a new digital advertisement Friday slamming former President Donald Trump's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe 30-second ad, first shared with NBC News, features audio of Trump's criticism of the ACA as text on the screen details what a second Trump term would mean for health care.\n\n\"When he was president, Donald Trump tried to rip away our health care,\" the text reads.\n\n\"Obamacare is a disaster,\" Trump says as the text appears.\n\nThe messages are overlaid on an image of a heart monitor, which eventually flatlines.\n\n\"If he succeeds ... 45 million Americans could lose their health insurance,\" the ad's message said. \"And you could be one of them.\"\n\nThe ad, titled \"Flatline,\" is released just one day before the 14th anniversary of the act being signed into law. It will air on platforms, including YouTube and Meta, across battleground states, according to the campaign.\n\n\"It\u2019s not hyperbole to say that affordable health care for millions of people is on the line in November,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement about the ad. \"I am more determined than ever to beat back MAGA Republican attacks and make health care a right and not a privilege in America. I know that we will.\u201d\n\nThe health care act was a signature part of then-President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda. The legislation required that all states provide marketplaces for health insurance, and millions of people have signed up for coverage through those exchanges since.\n\nTrump had pushed for the ACA to be repealed during his presidency. In 2017, an Obamacare repeal bill narrowly failed when three Republican senators and all Democrats voted against it.\n\nTrump revived his push against the ACA just last year, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social, that he was \"seriously looking at alternatives.\" He later doubled down on those comments, saying that he wanted to \"replace\" Obamacare.\n\nOther Republicans have signaled willingness to partner with Trump on repealing and replacing the landmark law, with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, arguing that \"a lot of the plans of the ACA are really expensive and really low-quality.\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, cited similar concerns about affordability, saying, \u201cLowering premiums is critically important to Texans.\u201d\n\nBut Biden maintains that the plans are affordable.\n\n\"When I ran for president in 2020, I promised the American people that I would protect the Affordable Care Act from partisan attacks and build on it,\" he said in the statement. \"That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve done: getting more people affordable health insurance, lowering prescription drug prices, and giving families more breathing room.\"\n\nBiden often touts his administration\u2019s health care policies during speeches, citing the White House\u2019s announcement in October that major drug companies agreed to participate in Medicare drug price negotiations with the government, and the administration\u2019s move to impose a $35 cap on out-of-pocket costs of insulin for seniors who have Medicare.\n\nA record 20 million Americans signed up for health insurance through the ACA this year.",

Kennedy Jr. apologized to members of his family who objected to a new TV ad released Sunday during the Super Bowl that repurposed a spot from his uncle\u2019s 1960 campaign.\n\nThe retro-themed ad from a PAC backing his candidacy mimics the soundtrack and theme of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 campaign ad. The spot features a dramatic orchestra opening and a jingle repeating the word \u201cKennedy\u201d over and over again.\n\nThe ad also feature the lyrics, \u201cDo you want a man for president who sees it through and through? A man who\u2019s old enough to know and young enough to do.\u201d The words are a potential jab from the 70-year-old Kennedy toward his somewhat older competitors, 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, in a race defined by criticisms of age and mental cognition.\n\n\u201cMy cousin\u2019s Super Bowl ad used our uncle\u2019s faces- and my Mother\u2019s. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA,\u201d Kennedy\u2019s cousin Bobby Shriver said on X following the release of the ad.\n\nAnother of Kennedy\u2019s cousins, Mark Shriver, replied to Bobby Shiver\u2019s post by saying \u201cI agree with my brother @bobbyshriver simple as that.\u201d\n\nBobby and Mark Shriver are sons of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President Kennedy and the late Attorney General Robert F.

The ad was created and aired by the American Values Superpac without any involvement or approvals from my campaign. Federal rules prohibit Superpacs from consulting with me or my staff. I send you and your family my sincerest apologies. God bless you,\u201d Kennedy posted on X.\n\nAmerican Values 2024, the group supporting Kennedy\u2019s presidential bid, spent $7 million on the ad. More recently, the PAC faced allegations from the Democratic National Committee that it illegally contributed to Kennedy\u2019s signature-gathering efforts.\n\nKennedy has faced dissent from members of his family throughout his presidential run. On the day of he announced his intention to run for president as an independent, a group of his siblings called his decision to run against Biden in a general election \u201cdangerous to our country.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been a leading proponent of vaccine misinformation through his Children\u2019s Health Defense organization and has spent years wrongly suggesting that many vaccines are not safe. In a CNN interview in December, he walked back some of his comments and rejected the label that he\u2019s \u201canti-vaccine\u201d despite his history of spreading misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines.\n\nHe also made a series of comments in 2022 in which he compared the Covid-19 lockdowns to Nazi Germany, arguing that \u201ceven in Hitler\u2019s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland.\u201d\n\n\u201cBobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment,\u201d Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph P Kennedy II and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement in October.\n\nCNN\u2019s Liz Brown-Kaiser contributed to this story.",

            "text": "In a recent commentary, a prominent conservative voice raised a compelling argument that may prompt a shift in the traditional voting patterns of some Republicans, particularly in their stance towards former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe commentator in question, Mona Charen, who has a background as a staffer in the Reagan White House and is currently a columnist for The Bulwark, has publicly criticized another veteran of the Reagan era for expressing dissatisfaction with the electoral choices available this year, Raw Story reported.\n\nCharen\u2019s critique goes beyond mere disapproval; she boldly suggests that devout conservatives should seriously reconsider their allegiance to Trump, advocating instead for support towards a third-party candidate, or more radically, a switch to support Democrat President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe world might look very different if traditional Republicans had been willing to stand firm for their values when they came under assault from an ignorant, cruel demagogue,\u201d Charen wrote. \u201cSo I was briefly optimistic when I saw that an honest-to-goodness Reaganite, John Lehman, who served as secretary of the Navy under Reagan, had weighed in [with a Wall Street Journal op-ed]. The headline was promising: \u2018Reagan Would Never Vote for Trump.\u2019 But after that bold beginning, the subhead was deflating: \u2018He also didn\u2019t care much for Biden. Like me, he\u2019d be looking for a strong third-party candidate to support,\u201d Charen continued.\n\nCharen\u2019s contention is not made lightly. She acknowledges the longstanding grievances that many conservatives, including those from the Reagan era, have held against Biden. These grievances stem from Biden\u2019s historical opposition to the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork\u2014a move that rankled many in the conservative camp during the 1980s\u2014as well as his advocacy for a nuclear freeze, a stance at odds with the prevailing conservative doctrine of the time.\n\nHowever, Charen finds it bewildering that despite these past conflicts, there seems to be a reluctance to support Biden, who, in her view, stands as the most viable contender against Trump\u2019s bid to disrupt the constitutional and democratic fabric of the nation.\n\nCharen\u2019s argument extends beyond mere political strategy; it touches on a moral imperative that she believes should guide the decision-making of Republicans in this crucial election. Drawing on the sentiments expressed by Dick Cheney, who has characterized Trump as an unprecedented threat to the American republic in its over two-century history, Charen implores her fellow conservatives to reassess their priorities.\n\nShe criticizes the tendency to treat voting as an exercise in maintaining ideological purity or preserving one\u2019s conservative credentials, arguing that such an approach is myopic and overlooks the broader implications of a potential Trump reelection.\n\nThe stakes, as Charen outlines, are not just political but existential for the values and institutions that define the American republic. She warns of the dire consequences that could ensue from Trump\u2019s return to power, including the undermining of cherished freedoms and the erosion of democratic traditions.\n\nCharen is particularly alarmed by Trump\u2019s promises, which include pardoning individuals involved in the January 6 insurrection, targeting his critics with imprisonment, and fostering an alliance with Russia. These actions, she argues, represent a clear and present danger to the nation\u2019s democratic framework.\n\nIn framing her argument, Charen seeks to galvanize a sense of urgency among Republicans, urging them to make a decisive choice in the face of an election that could significantly alter the course of American democracy. She posits that a reelected Biden would ensure the stability and security of the nation, contrasting starkly with the tumultuous and potentially authoritarian trajectory that a Trump victory could herald.\n\nFor Charen, the decision is not just about political affiliation or loyalty to conservative principles; it is about safeguarding the foundational values and institutions that underpin American democracy.\n\nIt\u2019s official. Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee for President. Democrats, Republicans, Independents. Anyone who cares about preventing a morally bankrupt sociopathic from destroying our Democracy, will vote for Joe and preserve our 249 years of self rule. \u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) March 13, 2024\n\nHere is a montage of Republicans saying they will not vote for Donald Trump in November pic.twitter.com/lgaMLNkhZU \u2014 Biden-Harris HQ (@BidenHQ) March 16, 2024\n\n27% of Ohio voters are voting against Trump tonight.

            "text": "Earlier this month, the Justice Department took the unusual step of moving to dismiss a $3.3 billion civil fraud lawsuit against Dish Network, after founders Charlie Ergen and his wife joined President Biden\u2019s re-election campaign late last year. This comes just months after he donated more than $113,000.\n\nErgen, a former professional poker player who helped start the company then called EchoStar Communications in 1980, has been fighting federal fraud claims for nearly a decade.\n\nBut the Tennessee native donated $100,000 to Biden\u2019s super PAC with his spouse, Candy, shortly after reaching the cap with a matching $6,600 contribution to the president\u2019s primary campaign committee in December. , reported that he saw his luck change. Campaign finance declaration form.\n\nIn January of this year, Dish $50 million Government grants to support national expansion of 5G coveragebiggest prize\u201d and the company has gushed about this kind of project through a $1.5 billion fund established by CHIPS and Science Law.\n\nDish Chairman Charlie Ergen has been fighting a civil fraud lawsuit for nearly a decade that could bankrupt the company. Reuters\n\nOn January 12, two days after the $50 million award was announced, Justice Department lawyers intervened on Dish\u2019s behalf, calling Vermont Telephone, which had made fraudulent claims, \u201cinto an unethical settlement.\u201d He threatened her and \u201ctried to bully her.\u201d Lead attorney Bennett Ross said the lawsuit will be dismissed.\n\nThe motion to dismiss the case reversed plans to dismiss the Ergens for their knowledge of the fraud scheme and led Vermont Telephone\u2019s lawyers to accuse the Justice Department of political interference.\n\n\u201c[I]\u201dThe effect, if not the purpose, of the Department of Justice\u2019s hasty dismissal of this case appears to be to protect Mr. Ergen from questioning under oath,\u201d Ross wrote in a letter to the Justice Department\u2019s lead attorney in the case. I wrote this in a letter dated August 8th. , according to a copy seen by The Post.\n\n\u201cIt just so happens that Mr. Ergen, his wife (who is scheduled to be removed from office next week), and DISH\u2019s political action committee have collectively donated more than $5 million to Democratic candidates and campaigns between 2008 and 2022. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAs the election approaches, this case appears to be the latest example of the Justice Department\u2019s two-tiered justice system, where wealthy and politically connected people are treated one way and everyone else is treated differently. \u201d\n\nThe government formally filed a motion to dismiss on March 8. Sentencing by D.C. Senior District Judge Colleen Koller Kotelly is pending.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division is objecting to the lawsuit being dismissed in 2022 and 2023, according to court filings, which say it is highly unusual to intervene in such fraud claims.\n\nThe Commerce Department gave Dish its \u201clargest award\u201d to date from the $1.5 billion fund created by the CHIPS and Science Act, one of the Biden administration\u2019s most celebrated achievements. AP\n\n\u201cAs far as we know, the parties involved have filed approximately 4,000 complaints.\u201d [similar] \u201cSince 2018, the Department of Justice has filed dismissal claims in about 65 of the False Claims Act cases, less than 2% of the time,\u201d Ross told the Post.\n\n\u201cAnd in the cases the Justice Department has sought to dismiss, it has generally been based on fatal flaws in the case, which does not apply to Vermont Telephone\u2019s claims against DISH.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the paucity of evidence and the difficulty of proving damages, the government\u2019s benefit in continuing the lawsuit is minimal. To the contrary, as a result of the extraordinary discovery, The costs to the government (and this court) will be high.\u201d\n\nBy taking control of small businesses, Dish acquired an additional $3.3 billion in wireless licenses before the company offered cell phone service. Gary E. Dufour/Facebook\n\nThe dispute began in 2015, and according to previous FCC filings, Dish is considered a \u201cvery small business\u201d (defined as a business with less than $15 million in revenue) by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). $13.3 billion was bid for wireless licenses as part of an auction aimed at supporting the United States. report According to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWith the help of asset management firm BlackRock, Dish has acquired nearly half of the wireless licenses (spectrum) sold at auction by small and medium-sized businesses (702 out of 1,600) in which Dish has a controlling interest and is eligible for a 25% discount. ).\n\nThis allowed Dish to make a $3.3 billion bid for spectrum in Boston, New York, and Chicago before the company offered cell phone service.\n\nAccording to a May 13, 2015 complaint, the Vermont Telephone Company sued Dish and its small businesses, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing them of engaging in a \u201cfraudulent bidding scheme.\u201d vermont telephone company\n\n\u201cDefendants shorted the government $3.3 billion, which remains unpaid to this day,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThey also corrupted programs designed to benefit genuine small businesses, distorted the FCC auction process, and impeded the deployment of wireless spectrum for the public benefit. Defendants are held accountable.\u201d You should.\u201d\n\nThe FCC later dismissed these claims of fraud, but Dish did not receive the $3.3 billion in bidding credits it earned in the auction, which were returned to the pool to be auctioned later.\n\nA senior FCC official told the Post that the agency was \u201cnot in a position to determine whether it was fraud\u201d at the time and was \u201choping that this action would set the record straight.\u201d\n\nHowever, the official said, \u201cDish has annual revenues of well over $10 billion, continues to be profitable, and receives FCC subsidies for companies with less than $50 million in revenue. We established a shell company for this purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that the Justice Department would try to dismiss it at the 11th hour without any intention.\u201d\n\n\u201cDish has generated and continues to generate well over $10 billion in annual revenue, but it has created a shell company to receive FCC subsidies for companies with less than $50 million in revenue. established,\u201d a senior FCC official told the Post. AP\n\nAs the lawsuit progresses, Dish has grown to become the fourth largest wireless network in the United States, thanks to acquisitions of carriers such as Sprint. In September 2023, Dish\u2019s net worth was approximately $54 billion.\n\nDish has pledged to spend billions of dollars building out its 5G network, leaving its own wireless spectrum occupied at the same time its TV customers are hemorrhaging and putting its business in a precarious position. There is.\n\nspeculation swirled A person familiar with the matter said the station could file for bankruptcy this year after its acquisition by Echostar left it \u201ccash-strapped,\u201d and an unfavorable civil lawsuit could result in 60. It added that more than $1 billion in damages could be awarded.\n\nLast year, Ergen acknowledged on an earnings call that the \u201cbond market is essentially closed\u201d for the company, with its bonds trading at just 30 cents on the dollar. This indicates that investors think the company is unlikely to pay off its debt. Last year, he even flew to Dubai in hopes of collaborating with a Middle East sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOther sources said Ergen has been \u201cvery close to the White House\u201d throughout Biden\u2019s tenure, frequently \u201cbragging\u201d about his connections and even been seen coming in and out of FCC headquarters.\n\nSources told the Post that Ergen has been \u201cvery close to the White House\u201d throughout Biden\u2019s tenure, frequently \u201cbragging\u201d about his connections and frequenting FCC headquarters. It has also been seen there. AFP (via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cDish is very good at navigating the beltway,\u201d said Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics. They have strong relationships on both sides of the aisle. \u201d\n\nMr. Ergen has donated most of his money to Democrats, but in recent years he has donated to more than a dozen people, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. He has also donated tens of thousands of dollars to several prominent Republicans. They all serve on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which oversees the FCC.\n\nThe Dish boss has also worked with influential Republicans such as Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee and if they If someone wanted to investigate him or his business, it could make his life difficult.\n\nwhite house visitor record show Ergen met with Biden officials at least three times, including on Oct. 16, 2023, with Kurt Campbell, then deputy chief of staff and now chief of staff.

Modernization efforts This is thanks to Dish\u2019s Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) technology.\n\n\u201cORAN provides them with what is considered a more affordable option because it separates software and hardware,\u201d one source said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to rely on proprietary technology to provide nationwide service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Dish keeps going to the White House and telling everyone, \u2018Listen, ORAN is the best thing since sliced \u200b\u200bbread,'\u201d the source said. added.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, that\u2019s exactly what the Biden administration wants to hear and wants other countries to sing the same song. There is a partnership between the two.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Ergen\u2019s political connections are enough to provide a lifeline to his company.\n\nDish reported earlier this month that it lost customers and revenue declined in the final quarter of 2023. He also acknowledged in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he \u201cexpects to use significant amounts of cash\u201d to repay debt, but cautioned that it was unclear how he would do so. He will pay the $1.98 billion debt he is due in November.\n\n\u201cThis raises significant doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d the filing acknowledges.\n\nJeff Blum, Echostar\u2019s executive vice president of external and government affairs, told the Post in a statement that \u201cfraud claims have always been frivolous, and the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to dismiss them is That\u2019s completely legitimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, the FCC thoroughly investigated the allegations and found no misrepresentations or wrongdoing by EchoStar or its business partners.The Department of Justice then gave VTel years to uncover evidence of fraud. \u201cBlum said.\n\n\u201cDespite tens of thousands of discovery documents and countless depositions, VTel has never been able to prove any wrongdoing. And last year, contrary to VTel\u2019s claims that the government had fallen short, , the government itself said in sworn testimony that all payments were made in a timely manner. It was a deadline. \u201d\n\nBloom said the motion is a \u201cdesperate attempt by VTel and its attorneys to avoid having to pay millions of dollars in legal fees on this baseless lawsuit.\u201d intends to pursue all legal remedies against the frivolous conduct of VTel and its lawyers.\u201d Claim. \u201c\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of record that Ecostar and Charlie Ergen have supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years,\u201d Blum added about the donations. \u201cAs EchoStar builds the world\u2019s largest Open RAN wireless network, we are working closely with policymakers on both sides to return U.S. leadership to carriers and create a true alternative to Chinese vendor dominance. We\u2019ve provided options.\u201d\n\nNeither the White House nor the Biden campaign responded to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment on pending litigation.",

            "text": "Former business associates of Hunter Biden are expected to testify publicly on Capitol Hill Wednesday as congressional Republicans begin the next phase of the impeachment inquiry against President Biden.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is expected to open the hearing by explaining that throughout the impeachment inquiry, investigators have \"found no credible evidence of the Bidens providing any work product\" and has \"identified no legitimate value or document or even one single hour of work that the Bidens have provided their business partners.\"\n\n\"What is apparent, after over a year of investigation, is that the Bidens do not work in any traditional sense of the word. They do not work as consultants. Or lawyers. Or advisors. The Bidens don\u2019t sell a product or a service or a set of skills,\" Comer will say, according to excerpts of his opening statement obtained by Fox News Digital. \"The Bidens sell Joe Biden.\n\nComer will say that Joe Biden \"has taken action after action to further his family\u2019s plans to get rich.\"\n\n\"The scam is simple. The Biden family promises they can make a foreign partner\u2019s problems go away by engaging the U.S. government,\" Comer will say. \"It\u2019s done over and over again. The Biden family promises Joe\u2019s power, Joe Biden shows up, and millions of dollars come into the Bidens\u2019 pockets.\"\n\nComer will add: \"Joe Biden is the Biden family\u2019s closer.\"\n\nTony Bobulinski, a U.S. Navy veteran, will appear publicly for a joint hearing of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees Wednesday morning.\n\nJason Galanis, who is serving a 14-year prison sentence, will also testify but will do so virtually from Federal Prison Camp, a minimum-security prison for male inmates in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN REFUSES TO ATTEND HOUSE HEARING WITH FORMER BUSINESS ASSOCIATES\n\nDemocrats have invited Lev Parnas, a former associate of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, to testify publicly as well.\n\nIn announcing the hearing earlier this month, Comer invited Hunter Biden to testify publicly as well, per the first son\u2019s repeated requests. Through his attorney Abbe Lowell, Hunter rejected the invitation.\n\nLowell, in a letter to the committees, called the hearing a \"carnival side show.\"\n\nComer also invited Hunter Biden\u2019s former associate, Devon Archer. Archer is not expected to attend.\n\nComer, though, has said he has \"called Hunter Biden's bluff.\"\n\nHUNTER BIDEN ADMITS HE PUT HIS FATHER ON SPEAKERPHONE, INVITED HIM TO MEETINGS, BUT DENIES 'INVOLVEMENT'\n\n\"Hunter Biden for months stated he wanted a public hearing, but now that one has been offered alongside his business associates that he worked with for years, he is refusing to come,\" Comer said. \"During our deposition and interview phase of our investigation, Hunter Biden confirmed key evidence, including evidence that his father, President Joe Biden, lied to the American people about his family\u2019s business dealings and, in fact, attended meetings, spoke on speakerphone and had coffee with his foreign business associates who collectively funneled millions to the Bidens.\"\n\nComer had subpoenaed Hunter Biden for a deposition scheduled for early December, but the president's son defied that subpoena for a closed-door deposition, demanding a public hearing instead. Comer vowed to give Hunter Biden that public hearing after the committee had him for a deposition \u2014 like all other witnesses.\n\n\"When you're investigating a family for this level of corruption you deserve the truth, the American people deserve the truth,\" Comer said. \"We're giving Hunter Biden a venue to testify publicly.\"\n\nHunter Biden appeared for his highly anticipated deposition last month before both the House Oversight and Judiciary committees and maintained that his father was never involved in and never benefited from his businesses.\n\nThe committee also heard testimony from James Biden, the president\u2019s younger brother, who testified the same.\n\nJOE BIDEN ALLEGEDLY CONSIDERED JOINING BOARD OF CCP-LINKED COMPANY, WITNESS TESTIFIES FROM PRISON\n\nHunter Biden did admit, however, that he put his father on speakerphone with his business associates and invited him to drop by his business lunches.\n\nArcher testified before the House Oversight Committee last year that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone at least 20 times with business associates.\n\nWithout Hunter and Archer, the hearing Wednesday will feature testimony from Bobulinski, who worked with Hunter Biden to create the joint venture SinoHawk Holdings with Chinese energy company CEFC. Bobulinski testified behind closed doors that he personally met with Joe Biden in 2017 for more than 45 minutes.\n\nBobulinski also testified that Joe Biden \"enabled\" his son Hunter to sell access to the \"most dangerous adversaries\" of the U.S., including the Chinese Communist Party, Russia and others.\n\nJOE BIDEN 'ENABLED' FAMILY TO SELL ACCESS TO 'DANGEROUS ADVERSARIES,' TONY BOBULINSKI TESTIFIES\n\nGalanis\u2019 testimony will also focus on whether Joe Biden was involved in the businesses he worked on with Hunter Biden.\n\nGalanis, who was interviewed by congressional investigators in prison last month, testified that Joe Biden was considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.\n\nGalanis also said that the words \"lean in\" were \"used often by Devon and Hunter in our business dealings as a term for access to Vice President Biden\u2019s political influence.\"\n\nERIC SCHWERIN CONFIRMS JOE BIDEN USED 'ROBINWARE456' EMAIL ALIAS WHILE SERVING AS VICE PRESIDENT\n\nGalanis is serving a 14-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to securities fraud based on bonds issued by a company affiliated with a Native American tribe in South Dakota. The funds were reportedly supposed to be used for certain projects but were instead used for his personal finances. He was sentenced in 2017.\n\nDEVON ARCHER: HUNTER BIDEN, BURISMA EXECS \u2018CALLED DC\u2019 TO GET UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR FIRED\n\nDemocrats have blasted what they call the \"hopeless impeachment investigation,\" with the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., telling Fox News Digital the inquiry \"originated with a bunch of lies told by an indicted liar in close proximity to Russian agents.\"\n\n\"So who better than Lev Parnas himself \u2014 Rudy Giuliani\u2019s right-hand man on the original mission to smear Joe Biden \u2014 to tell the story of how this campaign of lies and slander works?\" Raskin said. \"Lev Parnas can debunk the bogus claims at the heart of the impeachment probe and, in the process, explain how the GOP ended up in this degraded and embarrassing place.\"",

On the back of his fiery State of the Union speech, a robust economy, and, now, a handful of favorable polls, it sure seems as if things are looking up for the president.\n\nAnd if the success of his own policies and oratory has given him a boost, he\u2019s getting even more help from Republicans. Recently, both Trump and Republican members of Congress have generously (inadvertently) taken to making Biden\u2019s case for him\u2014grabbing the third rail of American politics with both hands by pledging to cut beloved entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Republican Study Committee rolled out its newest budget plan. It calls for raising the eligibility age for Social Security, a major benefit cut; overhauling Medicare into a voucherlike \u201cpremium support\u201d system, a privatization gambit Paul Ryan once pined for, ultimately to his own political disadvantage; and an endorsement of the Life at Conception Act, which was already under attack because it would severely restrict not just abortion but likely in vitro fertilization as well.\n\nPublication of this budget, by the way, is totally optional. This proposal is usually created as a forward-looking wish list, not a practicable charter. But there was nothing compelling the influential RSC to put out this document, particularly in an election year. (Also, the committee has other immediate, practical budget concerns, as it tries to put together a package to keep the government funded.) And yet, the RSC\u2014which numbers some 170 members, including Speaker Mike Johnson and his top three deputies in Republican leadership\u2014went ahead and published it anyway, putting some extremely unpopular policy proposals on the record. The attack ads will be functionally written with a simple copy-paste.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that, for years, Republicans have longed for cuts to social welfare programs. The one defiant exception to that group has been Donald Trump, who used to be able to distance himself from this stuff. He famously ran in 2016 as the only Republican presidential candidate resolutely opposed to Medicare and Social Security cuts. No longer, it seems. In a recent interview on CNBC, Trump seemingly admitted to being on board with the broader Republican plan of curtailing both programs, saying that there was \u201ca lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting,\u201d grabbing that third rail himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose comments, predictably, led to criticism, and the Trump campaign tried to walk them back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the Biden campaign had already pounced. There is no point of comparison between the two candidates the White House would rather talk about. Trump\u2019s comments have already been clipped and circulated widely, and they will be a constant fixture of the Biden messaging strategy until November.\n\nNot on my watch. https://t.co/RAHjjUlGDa \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 11, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany of my Republican friends want to put social security and Medicare back on the chopping block again,\u201d Biden said in a campaign speech in New Hampshire. \u201cI\u2019m never going to allow that to happen.\u201d In fact, the White House has now pledged to increase benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s good reason the Biden camp is loving this. In an age of great polarization, polling on these particular policies is resounding and bipartisan. Data for Progress found that only 8 percent of likely voters support raising the retirement age. Of Republican voters, only 9 percent are in support. It is \u201camong the most unpopular policies we have tested,\u201d the polling group wrote in a tweet.\n\nThe Trump team\u2019s attempt to split the difference on Social Security and Medicare cuts, already a near-impossible task, is made even more difficult by the RSC\u2019s new vision. It\u2019s a similar dynamic with abortion bans: Trump\u2019s equivocation on them will be a harder sell with the American public now that the House Republican Conference has seemingly lined up behind a bill that would likely enact some sort of IVF ban nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversion of Medicare to a voucherized, private market competitor is similarly unpopular. When Ryan, along with running mate Mitt Romney, championed it in 2012, the Obama-Biden ticket seized on it with glee. Attacking that policy became a fixture of the race and no doubt helped the Democratic president win reelection that year.\n\nSo, despite Biden\u2019s weaknesses, Republicans have now cleared the path for him to run on one of the simplest, most popular policies in America\u2014while embracing a platform reviled by 9 in 10 members of the Republican Party. It\u2019s the sort of advantage a presidential campaign can only dream about, and Republicans have dropped it in Biden\u2019s lap without antagonization.\n\nOf course, Republicans may be so confident about their election prospects that they feel no need to withhold their intentions to pursue radically unpopular policy changes come 2025. But there\u2019s a lot of this election cycle left to go, and voluntarily yoking themselves to something a lot of people would really hate is a bold choice.",

            "text": "Share and Follow\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s reelection campaign is eyeing North Carolina as a state to flip in 2024, a place where former President Trump barely eked out a win the last time the two went head-to-head.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign acknowledges it will \u201ctake relentless effort\u201d to reach every voter it can by November, the Tar Heel State is seen as an opportunity, especially given a gubernatorial race that could boost Biden.\n\nBut strategists question how feasible that goal is, given the state hasn\u2019t gone to a Democrat since 2008 and went to Trump in his last two White House bids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still aspirational, but the state is definitely in play,\u201d said GOP strategist Doug Heye. \u201cTrump should win it. If I were betting on it, I would bet Trump would win.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina is part of the Biden campaign\u2019s pathway-to-270 strategy through critical swing states, which include the so-called blue wall made up of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; western battlegrounds including Nevada and Arizona; and southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina is included as part of a $30 million six-week advertising blitz the campaign announced after the State of the Union address to spend big in battleground states. Biden recently did radio interviews around Super Tuesday in Fayetteville and Charlotte to reach Black North Carolinians, one of several voting factions key to another victory.\n\nBiden and Vice President Harris will travel to North Carolina on March 26 as part of their effort to travel to every battleground state in March.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians know that while President Biden is fighting for us, Donald Trump is fighting for billionaires, corporations, and an extreme agenda that hurts our families and our economy,\u201d Biden campaign\u2019s North Carolina communications director Dory MacMillan told The Hill. \u201cOur campaign will continue to communicate across every corner of this state to reject Trump\u2019s attacks on our families and earn four more years of progress with President Biden.\u201d\n\nThe campaign currently has a $155 million war chest, but aside from spending and infrastructure, a major factor that strategists say can help Biden in the Tar Heel State is the governor\u2019s race, which includes far-right Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson on the ballot.\n\n\u201cGiven the very weak Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina and a very sophisticated operation from the Democratic candidate, the Biden team will have an even better opportunity to win there this time around because of the demographic shifts and a robust coordinated campaign in a state he barely lost,\u201d said Michael LaRosa, first lady Jill Biden\u2019s traveling press secretary during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMike Lonergan, the communications director for Mark Robinson for Governor, criticized Biden and Robinson\u2019s Democratic opponent Josh Stein in a statement to The Hill, saying Stein \u201cstands with President Biden\u2019s open-borders policies and would turn North Carolina into a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants; and he\u2019s backed by far-left radicals that want to defund the police.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cThe Democrats will stop at nothing to smear Mark Robinson because they know North Carolina voters have had enough of extremism and lies from career politicians like Joe Biden and Josh Stein.\u201d\n\nTrump barely beat Biden in North Carolina last time around by less than 1 percentage point. The last Democrat to win the state in a presidential contest was then-Democratic nominee Barack Obama, but he lost his reelection bid there to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by 2 percentage points. Trump won the state when he ran for the White House the first time in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points.\n\nAn aggregation of polls shows Trump with a 7.4 point lead over Biden in North Carolina, a wider lead than the former president has managed in other battleground states.\n\n2024 could prove to be a split-ticket situation in North Carolina, where Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Stein wins while Trump takes the state, considering that when Trump won the state in 2020, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was reelected to a second term.\n\nThe GOP nominee for superintendent, who would oversee the public schools in North Carolina, is also troubling to some moderate Republicans. Social media posts have emerged of Michele Morrow calling for former President Obama to be publicly executed, CNN reported.\n\nGiven the slate of Republican candidates, Democrats believe pouring efforts into North Carolina is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart bet,\u201d said Ivan Zapien, former official at the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Republicans have nominated some down-ballot candidates that are not going to do well in the suburbs, assuming the suburbs perform like they have been performing [in] the last cycles. It\u2019s ripe for a pickup.\u201d\n\nStill, Democrats acknowledge it\u2019s an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is ripe to flip, but it\u2019s still North Carolina,\u201d LaRosa said.\n\nRepublicans like Heye, a North Carolina native, say the state\u2019s not a forgone conclusion given its demographic developments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an outside chance that the Democrats take it because of the closeness of the state, because of the fast growth in the state, particularly in two parts Charlotte and Raleigh and their suburban areas,\u201d he said.\n\nGrowth in areas like Charlotte and Raleigh has comprised an uptick in young, professional, suburban women, who helped give Democrats better-than-expected results in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nBlack voters are also a pivotal voting bloc in North Carolina, which is home to 11 historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nJim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, compared North Carolina to Georgia, a state that helped push Biden over the edge in 2020 in large part because of support from Black voters.\n\n\u201cThey each have a growing share of college-educated voters that have become essential for Democrats. Georgia has more African American voters, which proved to be the difference in 2020, but North Carolina is starting to look like the kind of state where Democrats should prevail,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was updated at 8:57 p.m.",

            "text": "Young People Aren\u2019t Nearly Angry Enough About Government Debt\n\nAuthored by The American Institute for Economic Research,\n\nYoung people sometimes seem to wake up in the morning in search of something to be outraged about. We are among the wealthiest and most educated humans in history. But we\u2019re increasingly convinced that we\u2019re worse off than our parents were, that the planet is in crisis, and that it\u2019s probably not worth having kids.\n\nI\u2019ll generalize here about my own cohort (people born after 1981 but before 2010), commonly referred to as Millennials and Gen Z, as that shorthand corresponds to survey and demographic data. Millennials and Gen Z have valid economic complaints, and the conditions of our young adulthood perceptibly weakened traditional bridges to economic independence. We graduated with record amounts of student debt after President Obama nationalized that lending. Housing prices doubled during our household formation years due to zoning impediments and chronic underbuilding. Young Americans say economic issues are important to us, and candidates are courting our votes by promising student debt relief and cheaper housing (which they will never be able to deliver).\n\nYoung people, in our idealism and our rational ignorance of the actual appropriations process, typically support more government intervention, more spending programs, and more of every other burden that has landed us in such untenable economic circumstances to begin with. Perhaps not coincidentally, young people who\u2019ve spent the most years in the increasingly partisan bubble of higher education are also the most likely to favor expanded government programs as a \u201csolution\u201d to those complaints.\n\nIt\u2019s Your Debt, Boomer\n\nWhat most young people don\u2019t yet understand is that we are sacrificing our young adulthood and our financial security to pay for debts run up by Baby Boomers. Part of every Millennial and Gen-Z paycheck is payable to people the same age as the members of Congress currently milking this system and miring us further in debt.\n\nOur government spends more than it can extract from taxpayers. Social Security, which represents 20 percent of government spending, has run an annual deficit for 15 years. Last year Social Security alone overspent by $22.1 billion. To keep sending out checks to retirees, Social Security goes begging to the Treasury Department, and the Treasury borrows from the public by issuing bonds. Bonds allow investors (who are often also taxpayers) to pay for some retirees\u2019 benefits now, and be paid back later. But investors only volunteer to lend Social Security the money it needs to cover its bills because the (younger) taxpayers will eventually repay the debt \u2014 with interest.\n\nIn other words, both Social Security and Medicare, along with various smaller federal entitlement programs, together comprising almost half of the federal budget, have been operating for a decade on the principle of \u201cgive us the money now, and stick the next generation with the check.\u201d We saddle future generations with debt for present-day consumption.\n\nThe second largest item in the budget after Social Security is interest on the national debt \u2014 largely on Social Security and other entitlements that have already been spent. These mandatory benefits now consume three quarters of the federal budget: even Congress is not answerable for these programs. We never had the chance for our votes to impact that spending (not that older generations were much better represented) and it\u2019s unclear if we ever will.\n\nYoung Americans probably don\u2019t think much about the budget deficit (each year\u2019s overspending) or the national debt (many years\u2019 deficits put together, plus interest) much at all. And why should we? For our entire political memory, the federal government, as well as most of our state governments, have been steadily piling \u201cpublic\u201d debt upon our individual and collective heads. That\u2019s just how it is. We are the frogs trying to make our way in the watery world as the temperature ticks imperceptibly higher. We have been swimming in debt forever, unaware that we\u2019re being economically boiled alive.\n\nMillennials have somewhat modest non-mortgage debt of around $27,000 (some self-reports say twice that much), including car notes, student loans, and credit cards. But we each owe more than $100,000 as a share of the national debt. And we don\u2019t even know it.\n\nWhen Millennials finally do have babies (and we are!) that infant born in 2024 will enter the world with a newly minted Social Security Number and $78,089 credit card bill for Granddad\u2019s heart surgery and the interest on a benefit check that was mailed when her parents were in middle school.\n\nHeadlines and comments sections love to sneer at \u201csnowflakes\u201d who\u2019ve just hit the \u201creal world,\u201d and can\u2019t figure out how to make ends meet, but the kids are onto something. A full 15 percent of our earnings are confiscated to pay into retirement and healthcare programs that will be insolvent by the time we\u2019re old enough to enjoy them. The Federal Reserve and government debt are eating the economy. The same interest rates that are pushing mortgages out of reach are driving up the cost of interest to maintain the debt going forward. As we learn to save and invest, our dollars are slowly devalued. We\u2019re right to feel trapped.\n\nSure, if we\u2019re alive and own a smartphone, we\u2019re among the one percent of the wealthiest humans who\u2019ve ever lived. Older generations could argue (persuasively!) that we have no idea what \u201cpoverty\u201d is anymore. But with the state of government spending and debt\u2026we are likely to find out.\n\nDespite being richer than Rockefeller, Millennials are right to say that the previous ways of building income security have been pushed out of reach. Our earning years are subsidizing not our own economic coming-of-age, but bank bailouts, wars abroad, and retirement and medical benefits for people who navigated a less-challenging wealth-building landscape.\n\nRedistribution goes both ways. Boomers are expected to pass on tens of trillions in unprecedented wealth to their children (if it isn\u2019t eaten up by medical costs, despite heavy federal subsidies) and older generations\u2019 financial support of the younger has had palpable lifting effects. Half of college costs are paid by families, and the trope of young people moving back home is only possible if mom and dad have the spare room and groceries to make that feasible.\n\nGovernment \u201chelp\u201d during COVID-19 resulted in the worst inflation in 40 years, as the federal government spent $42,000 per citizen on \u201cstimulus\u201d efforts, right around a Millennial\u2019s average salary at that time. An absurd amount of fraud was perpetrated in the stimulus to save an economy from the lockdown that nearly ruined it. Trillions in earmarked goodies were rubber stamped, carelessly added to young people\u2019s growing bill. Government lenders deliberately removed fraud controls, fearing they couldn\u2019t hand out $800 billion in young people\u2019s future wages away fast enough. Important lessons were taught by those programs. The importance of self-sufficiency and the dignity of hard work weren\u2019t top of the list.\n\nBoomer Benefits are Stagnating Hiring, Wages, and Investment for Young People\n\nEven if our workplace engagement suffered under government distortions, Millennials continue to work more hours than other generations and invest in side hustles and self employment at higher rates. Working hard and winning higher wages almost doesn\u2019t matter, though, when our purchasing power is eaten from the other side. Buying power has dropped 20 percent in just five years. Life is $11,400/year more expensive than it was two years ago and deficit spending is the reason why.\n\nWe\u2019re having trouble getting hired for what we\u2019re worth, because it costs employers 30 percent more than just our wages to employ us. The federal tax code both requires and incentivizes our employers to transfer a bunch of what we earned directly to insurance companies and those same Boomer-busted federal benefits, via tax-deductible benefits and payroll taxes. And the regulatory compliance costs of ravenous bureaucratic state. The price paid by each employer to keep each employee continues to rise \u2014 but Congress says your boss has to give most of the increase to someone other than you.\n\nFederal spending programs that many people consider good government, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance for children (CHIP) aren\u2019t a small amount of the federal budget. Government spends on these programs because people support and demand them, and because cutting those benefits would be a re-election death sentence. That\u2019s why they call cutting Social Security the \u201cthird rail of politics.\u201d If you touch those benefits, you die. Congress is held hostage by Baby Boomers who are running up the bill with no sign of slowing down.\n\nYoung people generally support Social Security and the public health insurance programs, even though a 2021 poll by Nationwide Financial found 47 percent of Millennials agree with the statement \u201cI will not get a dime of the Social Security benefits I have earned.\u201d\n\nIn the same survey, Millennials were the most likely of any generation to believe that Social Security benefits should be enough to live on as a sole income, and guessed the retirement age was 52 (it\u2019s 67 for anyone born after 1959 \u2014 and that\u2019s likely to rise). Young people are the most likely to see government guarantees as a valid way to live \u2014 even though we seem to understand that those promises aren\u2019t guarantees at all.\n\nHealthcare costs tied to an aging population and wonderful-but-expensive growth in medical technologies and medications will balloon over the next few years, and so will the deficits in Boomer benefit programs. Newly developed obesity drugs alone are expected to add $13.6 billion to Medicare spending. By 2030, every single Baby Boomer will be 65, eligible for publicly funded healthcare.\n\nThe first Millennial will be eligible to claim Medicare (assuming the program exists and the qualifying age is still 65, both of which are improbable) in 2046. As it happens, that\u2019s also the year that the Boomer benefits programs (which will then be bloated with Gen Xers) and the interest payments we\u2019re incurring to provide those benefits now, are projected to consume 100 percent of federal tax revenue.\n\nGovernment spending is being transferred to bureaucrats and then to the beneficiaries of government spending who are, in some sense, your diabetic grandma who needs a Medicare-paid dialysis treatment, but in a much more immediate sense, are the insurance companies, pharma giants, and hospital corporations who wrote the healthcare legislation. Some percentage of every college graduate\u2019s paycheck buys bullets that get fired at nothing and inflating the private investment portfolios of government contractors, with dubious, wasteful outcomes from the prison-industrial complex to the perpetual war machine.\n\nNo bank or nation in the world can lend the kind of money the American government needs to borrow to fulfill its obligations to citizens. Someone will have to bite the bullet. Even some of the co-authors of the current disaster are wrestling with the truth.\n\nForget avocado toast and streaming subscriptions. We\u2019re already sensing it, but we haven\u2019t yet seen it. Young people are not well-informed, and often actively misled, about what\u2019s rotten in this economic system. But we are seeing the consequences on store shelves and mortgage contracts and we can sense disaster is coming. We\u2019re about to get stuck with the bill.",

            "text": "In perhaps the least surprising news of the year, Vladimir Putin has triumphed at the Russian ballot box and been enthroned for the fifth time as president. He will serve for six more years.\n\nHe will be 77 years old in 2030. According to the constitution, which he re-wrote to his benefit in 2020, he then could stand again for a further six-year term.\n\nAcademic rigour, journalistic flair\n\nTHE CONVERSATION....\n\nBULLSHIT WITH RIGOUR AND JOURNALISTIC BIAS... CAPS ARE COMMENTS BY GUS....\n\nThe West can\u2019t \u2018solve\u2019 its Russia problem. Here\u2019s how it should handle 6 more years of Vladimir Putin\n\nTHE WEST DOES NOT HAVE A RUSSIA PROBLEM... RUSSIA HAS A WEST PROBLEM: THE WEST HAS BEEN DECEITFUL, WARMONGERING \u2014 AND SECRETLY WANTS TO DESTROY RUSSIA.\n\nBY Peter Tesch\n\nWHY NOT 6 MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT PUTIN?\n\nTo put that in perspective, Putin already has ruled Russia as president or prime minister for 24 years, or the equivalent of eight Australian parliamentary terms. In that period, Australia has had eight prime ministers and changed governing party three times. The United States has had five different presidents; the United Kingdom seven different prime ministers.\n\nIn contrast to elections in the West, where the outcomes are genuinely in the hands of the voters [AHAHAHA] and adjudicated by independent electoral commissions, Russia is different. As the former UK ambassador to Moscow, Laurie Bristow, wrote:\n\nIn Russia, the purpose of elections is to validate the decisions of its rulers, not to discover the will of the people.\n\nIN THE WEST, THE PURPOSE OF ELECTIONS IS TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING THEY HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN \"TWEEDUMDLE AND TWEEDUMDEE\"\u2026 WHILE THE PENTAGON IS RULING THE ROOST\u2026\n\nPETER TESCH CONTINUES:\n\nPutin\u2019s jaded view of the West\n\nPutin now will appoint a new government. His picks will be intensely scrutinised for clues to a succession plan and future policies. Although he is a master of surprise, we should not count on Putin leaving any time soon. Only four leaders of modern Russia and the USSR have left the top job alive; the rest have died in office of natural or other causes. SO?\n\nMoreover, Putin\u2019s actions over the past two years have been directed at moving Russia from authoritarianism to semi-totalitarianism. The Carnegie Endowment\u2019s Andrei Kolesnikov has written persuasively of these tectonic shifts that recall the darkest years of Soviet Stalinism.\n\nPutin has explicitly presented his war of choice in Ukraine as a proxy for a wider, long-term conflict with the West. He believes the West is irresolute, in decline, and easily distracted and deflected. PUTIN IS TOTALLY CORRECT.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chave at them\u201d attitude towards US allies and partners, and the woeful Western vacillation over further military aid to Ukraine, will only embolden Putin further. Buoyed by his ritual success in this weekend\u2019s election, he will embark on further risky and provocative adventurism. HE WON\u2019T. PUTIN DOES NOT WANT MORE TROUBLES. THE WEST DOES.\n\nRead more: What can we expect from six more years of Vladimir Putin? An increasingly weak and dysfunctional Russia\n\nBULLSHIT. WEAK AND DYSFUNCTIONAL? THE WEST IS IN A FAR MORE WEAK AND DYSFUNCTIONAL SITUATION.\n\nConsequently, Putin \u2013 and the ideology of \u201cPutinism\u201d \u2013 pose a serious challenge for Western governments and policymakers who are genuinely accountable to their electorates, [DO YOU THINK VON DER LEYEN, THIS UNELECTED WITCH OF EUROPE IS ACCOUNTABLE?] the party room, the parliamentary opposition, a vocal and inquisitorial media [DO YOU THINK THE WESTERN MEDIA ASKS QUESTIONS OF ITS OWN RULERS?]and an independent judiciary [LIKE THE INQUISITION AGAINST TRUMP IN THE USA?].\n\nAs exiled Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar has argued, part of Putin\u2019s statecraft is directed at making common cause with ultra-conservative Western political elements to contest global \u201cwokeness\u201d, demobilise support for [NAZI] Ukraine, and dull resistance to Russian territorial ambitions in its neighbourhood. PUTIN ONY HAS TERRITORIAL \u201cAMBITIONS\u201d TO TERRITORIES THAT WERE UNDER RUSSIAN CONTROL AND POPULATED BY RUSSIANS WHO BEG TO REJOIN RUSSIA\u2026 FAIR ENOUGH.\n\nHow democratic governments need to respond\n\nPutin is well aware that the inherent fractiousness of democracy and the need to court the fickle voters hobbles democratic governments\u2019 long-term planning. THE WEST IS AS DEMOCRATIC AS A DUNNY IS USEFUL ON THE MOON.\n\nMoreover, our political culture is predisposed to wanting to \u201csolve\u201d issues. MOST OF THE TIMES, THE WEST DOES NOT SOLVE ANYTHING BUT CREATES MORE PROBLEMS. Sometimes, though, problems of the scale posed by Russia or the Middle East can only be managed, not solved \u2013 and then only through joint efforts with like-minded allies and partners. That requires persistence and resilience to rise above short-term politicking and the twitches of our \u201cinstant expert\u201d social media culture. YES WE ARE EXPEDIENT AND BULLSHIT ABOUT OUR ABILITY OF \u201cEXPERTISE\u201d\u2026.\n\nIt also demands constant investment in building and sustaining public understanding of what really is at stake, beyond the borders of Europe that were drawn in the bloodshed and misery of the second world war. DOES THIS MEANS THAT THE WEST NEED TO TUNE THE STUPID PROPAGANDA TO 11? UKRAINE WAS ARTIFICIALLY DRAWN BY THE USSR...\n\nThis is difficult anywhere, not least in the West, where we have had it comparatively easy for most of the post-second world war era. [DID WE HAVE GOOD LEADERS THEN?] We need stalwart and principled leadership now more than at any other point in the last 50 years. Most of all, we need ongoing serious and informed public conversations [YES! WE LITTLE BOURGEOIS ENJOY THE SPOILS OF FOREVER WARS] about what we value in and wish for in democratic societies, and the price we are willing to pay to attain and preserve that. WE DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR VALUES, BUT ACCEPT THAT RUSSIA HAS ITS OWN VALUES AND DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE OVER OTHER LANDS \u2014 EXCEPT THE DONBASS REGION, AS WARNED BY PUTIN SINCE AT LEAST SINCE 2008, TO PREVENT NATO ILLEGALLY \u201cINVADING\u201d UKRAINE.\n\nRead more: Why the US and its partners cannot afford to go soft on support for Ukraine now\n\nBULLSHIT. MAKING A PROPER DEAL ISN\u2019T GOING SOFT, BUT RECOGNISING THAT UKRAINE 1991 IS NOT AN INTEGRAL COUNTRY\u2026 THE DONBASS WAS RUSSIAN AND IS NOW BECOMING RUSSIAN AGAIN.\n\nThat sort of discourse can be hard to generate in our politically rather apathetic society. However, it is vital when the institutions of our democracy are barraged by foreign information manipulation and interference designed to sow doubt and distrust and corrode popular faith in the integrity of our form of government. WE BULLSHIT FAR MORE THAN THE RUSSIANS WHO HAVE STUCK TO THE NARRATIVE SINCE AT LEAST 2014 IN REGARD TO UKRAINE.\n\nEspecially in Australia, we have allowed our already limited pool of Russia expertise to atrophy to near-extinction. It is well past time to re-invest, modestly but purposefully, in Russian language and associated studies at our universities. We need to boost \u201cRussia literacy\u201d and comprehension of a country that will remain a significant and disruptive player in the world. This matters to countries that matter to us. GREAT IDEA! YOU NEVER KNOW, WE MIGHT EVEN UNDERSTAND RUSSIA LIKE SCOTT RITTER DOES\u2026.\n\nWe should also honestly and critically assess the mistaken assumptions and indifference that at times have undermined effective Western policies towards post-Soviet Russia. However, we should not succumb to the propaganda peddled by Putin and his proteges abroad that Moscow is a blameless victim of Western perfidy and deception aimed at destroying the Russian state. THE WESTERN PERFIDY CANNOT BE GAUGED BY THE WEST, BECAUSE IT ORIGINATES FROM THE WEST.\n\nRather, as Australian professor Mark Edele writes in his recent book, Russia\u2019s War Against Ukraine:\n\nRussia never came to terms \u2013 either as a society or as a polity \u2013 with its transformation from a continental empire with global reach into a nation-state and a regional power. professor Mark Edele WROTE SHIT. The Kremlin is marketing Russia as an ally of \u201cthe Global South\u201d in resisting resurgent neo-colonialism and championing \u201cmultipolarity\u201d.\n\nWE HATE MULTIPOLARITY IN THE WEST BECAUSE IT CHALLENGES OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO DOMINATE (COLONISE) THE WORLD WITH AN ENGLISH/AMERICAN/JEWISH HEGEMONY\u2026\n\nThe Putin thesis is that Ukraine is a patsy of London and Washington, while Moscow is on the side of the formerly colonised. PUTIN IS CORRECT: WASHINGTON HAS CULTIVATED UKRAINE TO WEAKEN RUSSIA (THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION OWN WORDS). That argument is finding some ready ears, evident in the patchy support for sanctions on Russia [IT\u2019S NOT PATCHY \u2014 OUT OF 190 COUNTRIES OR SO IN THE WORLD, ONLY 15 OR SO ARE IN FAVOUR OF SANCTIONS,. We cannot assume our own Indo-Pacific region is persuaded of the wrongness of the Kremlin\u2019s claims. THE KREMLIN\u2019S CLAIMS ARE CORRECT.\n\nThe reality confronting us is that of a sullen and resentful Russia [NO, NOT SULLEN NOR RESENTFUL, \u2014 BUT CONFIDENT AND POSITIVE], convinced that history, morality and even divinity is on its side in a de facto existential war with the West. RUSSIA DOES NOT WANT WAR WITH THE WEST. RUSSIA HAS WANTED TO COOPERATE WITH THE WEST, BUT THE WEST REJECTED RUSSIA\u2026\n\nMoreover, as Bristow, my former colleague in Moscow, has written:\n\nwe would be unwise to assume that a rising generation of Russians will embrace a more democratic and pro-Western outlook.\n\nPRO-WESTERN OUTLOOK MEANS BUM-FIGHTS, RAMPANT ECONOMIC DOWNGRADE, SILLY LIES FROM ONE OR THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES, CORRUPTION WORSE THAN IN UKRAINE AND DELUSIONS OF GRANDEURS LONG VANISHED. NAPOLEON IS DEAD.\n\nYet, we must not turn away from those Russians \u2013 far from an irrelevant minority \u2013 who do not share Putin\u2019s view that the future of their country lies in the perceived glories of its past. The challenge is to articulate what a better future would look like for Russia, beyond confrontation, and to keep that alternative clearly in view.\n\nDO YOU MEAN THAT THE WEST SHOULD POLITICALLY INTERFERE INSIDE RUSSIA? WOW!!!!!!\n\nPACK YOUR BAG, \u201cTHE CONVERSATION\u201d\u2026.\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-west-cant-solve-its-russia-problem-heres-how-it-should-handle-6-more-years-of-vladimir-putin-225999\n\nFREE JULIAN ASSANGE NOW....",

            "text": "As we inch closer to the 2024 presidential election, the political landscape remains as tumultuous and competitive as ever. A recent slew of polls has provided fresh insights into the current standing between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, with the former narrowly edging ahead in the latest polling averages.\n\nIn the rematch of the 2020 presidential election, Biden is looking to build upon his prior victory, which saw him flipping crucial states like Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Trump, on the other hand, is endeavoring to regain the office he lost. It\u2019s a face-off that promises to be as intensely fought as their first bout.\n\nThe latest polling data marks a notable shift in the political narrative. Not long ago, betting analysis indicated a different story. According to OddsTrader, \u201cDonald Trump has overtaken Joe Biden as the favorite to win the presidency with odds of -110, implying a win probability of 52.38%.\u201d Betting odds are not the only measure of electoral prospects, but they are a window into public perception and sentiment.\n\nHowever, while bettors may be favoring Trump, a series of recent polls compiled by Public Policy Polling and others have painted a different picture, placing Biden slightly ahead. These polls take into account a range of factors, including quality, sample size, and recency, to give a clearer picture of the current political climate.\n\nWhile polls are a critical tool for gauging public opinion, they are not infallible, as the 2020 election reminded us. Pollsters have since been working to adjust their methodologies to correct for past biases, offering a polling average \u201cunskewer\u201d that allows users to make adjustments for perceived partisan leanings.\n\nThe significance of these polling averages cannot be overstated, especially when considering the all-important swing states that are likely to be decisive once again in the upcoming election. In 2020, Biden managed to clinch victory by winning over these battlegrounds, and both parties are aware that they will be the focus of fierce campaigning efforts in the months to come.\n\nMeanwhile, speculation continues to brew around other potential candidates who could stir the political pot. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, has seen his odds shorten to +2200, making him the fourth most likely option, according to oddsmakers. While Newsom endorsed Biden for a second term, his emerging as a dark horse within the Democratic Party introduces an element of unpredictability into an already charged race.\n\nOne thing is clear: Americans are closely watching the developments between Biden and Trump. The electoral college system in place, it is not merely a contest of popularity but one of strategic victories across the electoral map.\n\nAs of now, the latest polls suggest a tight race between the incumbent and his predecessor, with Biden holding a slight advantage. However, as the past has taught us, the road to the White House is long and filled with unexpected turns.\n\nRelevant articles:\n\n\u2013 Joe Biden now leads Donald Trump in presidential polling average\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in a call Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, directly tied Ukraine\u2019s withdrawal from the key town of Avdiivka to Congress\u2019 inability to pass further aid for the country\u2019s effort to fend off Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n\u201cThis morning, Ukraine\u2019s military was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka after Ukrainian soldiers had to ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction, resulting in Russia\u2019s first notable gains in months. President Biden emphasized the need for Congress to urgently pass the national security supplemental funding bill to resupply Ukrainian forces,\u201d according to a White House readout of the call.\n\nThe call bookended a week defined by US attempts to reassert leadership on the world stage. It also highlighted renewed urgency to pass additional funds for Ukraine amid the withdrawal from Avdiivka, a key town that in recent months became one of the most fiercely contested battles on the eastern front, and the news of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny\u2019s death.\n\nBiden told reporters later Saturday that he\u2019s not confident other Ukrainian towns wouldn\u2019t also fall, adding it is \u201cunethical\u201d that the US is not providing more aid to the Ukrainian people after they have fought \u201cso bravely and heroically.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea that now they are running out of ammunition, and we walk away. I find it absurd. I find it unethical,\u201d Biden said in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. \u201cI find it contrary to everything we are as a country.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, the Senate passed with bipartisan support a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill, which includes $60 billion to support Ukraine. However, GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he does not plan to bring the bill to the floor, and the House is on a two-week break.\n\nUS officials have recently expressed concern about Russian gains in the war, suggesting it\u2019s a reflection of a slowdown in aid. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson also said in a statement shared with CNN that the withdrawal from Avdiivka is a direct result of the foreign aid bill being stalled in Congress.\n\n\u201cThis is the cost of Congressional inaction. The Ukrainians continue to fight bravely, but they are running low on supplies. It is critical that the House approve additional Ukraine funding without delay so that we can provide Ukraine with the artillery ammunition and other critical equipment they need to defend their country,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden\u2019s call followed similar ones earlier Saturday from Vice President Kamala Harris and Zelensky urging Congress to pass additional aid for Ukraine, with Harris slamming House Republicans for stalling legislation.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and US Vice President Kamala Harris attend a news conference during the Munich Security Conference on February 17, 2024. Tobias Schwarz/Pool/Reuters\n\n\u201cPolitical gamesmanship has no role to play in what is fundamentally about the significance of standing with an ally as it endures an unprovoked aggression,\u201d Harris told reporters following a bilateral meeting with Zelensky at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.\n\nShe said she has \u201cfull belief that were the supplemental package and security package to make it to the floor of the House of Representatives, that it would actually pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, this package is vital,\u201d Zelensky said, according to a translation. \u201cWe do not currently look into alternatives because we are counting on the United States.\u201d\n\nWhile the Ukrainian leader said he does not consider the lack of additional funding a betrayal, he hinted at the House being on recess until the end of the month.\n\n\u201cPlease, everyone, remember that dictators do not go on vacation,\u201d he said during a speech at the conference. \u201cHatred knows no pause. Enemy artillery does not fall silent due to procedural issues.\u201d\n\nBiden on Friday criticized House lawmakers for taking a two-week break, calling it \u201coutrageous\u201d and telling reporters it\u2019s \u201cabout time they step up\u201d following the death of Russian opposition figure Navalny.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks, they\u2019re walking away,\u201d Biden said at the White House. \u201cTwo weeks. What are they thinking? My God, this is bizarre, and it\u2019s just reinforcing all of the concern and almost \u2013 I won\u2019t say panic \u2013 but real concern about the United States being a reliable ally. This is outrageous.\u201d\n\nUkraine has been facing renewed pressure across the eastern front in its war against Russia, compounded by ammunition and manpower shortages. The withdrawal from Avdiivka marks the biggest gain for Moscow since it captured the city of Bakhmut last year.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "text": "His team has set up two new joint fundraising committees to help close the gap.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee are, right now, facing a serious financial disadvantage in the early stages of the general election fight against President Joe Biden and his $100 million war chest, new filings show.\n\nBut with Trump becoming his party's 2024 presumptive presidential nominee earlier this month, he and the RNC are full steam ahead to make up for their fundraising lag -- launching a joint operation and planning a high-dollar event with GOP megadonors.\n\nFebruary financial filings for the Biden and Trump campaigns and respective Democratic and Republican parties, released on Wednesday, illustrate how much more money Biden has raised and currently has on hand compared to Trump, funds that can be used toward advertising, staffing and organizing.\n\nFinancial filings also detail the extent to which Trump's legal bills have eaten into the cash flow of some of his allied political groups.\n\nHe faces 88 criminal charges and multiple civil issues -- including the threat of seizure of his assets related to a $464 million judgment in a New York civil fraud case.\n\nHe denies all wrongdoing across the various cases and is appealing the civil fraud ruling, with just days left to provide a bond to cover that penalty.\n\nEntering March, Trump's presidential campaign and the RNC only had $42 million and $11 million respectively in the bank, about half of the more than $97 million the Biden campaign and the DNC jointly reported having as cash on hand in their latest filings.\n\nTrump's campaign fundraising ramped up in February as the former president continued to secure victories in early GOP nominating contests, holding successful events in Florida and South Carolina and bringing in roughly $11 million last month.\n\nIn this Feb. 7, 2024, file photo, President Joe Biden arrives at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York. He is visiting Manhattan to attend three Biden-Harris campaign fundraisers. Kyle Mazza/NurPhoto via AP\n\nBut so far this election cycle, the Biden campaign and the Democratic Party have enjoyed a major advantage over their Republican counterparts of being able to raise money together, because Democrats formally decided to rally around Biden even before the nominating race.\n\nThat allowed them to not only share fundraising resources but also to accept high-dollar donations north of $800,000.\n\nFilings show that the Trump campaign, in turn, has been spending much less so far this cycle compared to the same point in the 2020 election cycle, reporting expenditures of just $17 million in the first two months of this year compared to nearly $30 million that the campaign spent during the same period in the last presidential election.\n\nThe Biden campaign spent even less in the first two months of this year -- $12 million -- as the president mostly stayed away from the campaign trail while the GOP fight played out, according to the financial filings. But the DNC was active instead, spending nearly $30 million in the first two months\n\nThe fundraising gap could soon close, with Trump now raising money with the Republican Party as their official presumptive nominee.\n\nHowever, the way one of his new fundraising vehicles is arranged suggests a priority is also funneling money into a political action committee that has paid a significant portion of his ongoing legal bills.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a rally at the Dayton International Airport, on March 16, 2024, in Vandalia, Ohio. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nTrump's team recently set up two new joint fundraising committees with the GOP: one dubbed \"Trump 47 Committee,\" which raises money with his Save America leadership PAC, the RNC and 40 state GOP committees and can accept more than $800,000 per donor; and another named \"Trump National Committee JFC,\" which is likely going to focus on smaller-dollar joint fundraising.\n\nThe Trump 47 Committee is already throwing a major $814,600-per-ticket fundraiser in Palm Beach, Florida, next month, hosted by billionaire John Paulson and featuring dozens of major Republican names, including several former ambassadors and Trump administration officials like former Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon and former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as well as New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, according to an invitation to the fundraiser that was obtained by ABC News.\n\nOther major co-hosts include a former Trump campaign finance chair, Todd Ricketts, and energy mogul Harold Hamm, aerospace executive Robert Bigelow, hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah Mercer and casino tycoon Phil Ruffin, the invitation shows.\n\nNotably, amid the crush of legal bills, the new Trump 47 Committee is prioritizing Trump's Save America PAC -- which has footed tens of millions of dollars in Trump's legal bills over the last few years and is unable to use its money in support of Trump's reelection campaign because it's set up as his leadership PAC.\n\nAccording to an invitation for a fundraiser hosted by the joint fundraising committee, Save America is ahead of groups like the RNC and the 40 state party committees when it comes to the order for how donations are disbursed.\n\nFor example, the invitation's fine print shows that if a hypothetical $15,000 comes through the committee, the first $6,600 from the donor (or $10,000 from a PAC) goes to the Trump campaign and the next $5,000 goes to Save America -- before any of the funds would go to the Republican Party committees.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump gestures to the crowd at a campaign rally, on March 16, 2024, in Vandalia, Ohio. Jeff Dean/AP\n\nThis joint fundraising committee setup comes on the heels of Trump's Save America PAC burning through more than $8.5 million on legal bills just in the first two months of this year -- including $5.6 million in February -- as the former president continues to battle his criminal cases and civil trials across the country, per filings.\n\nLegal bills make up nearly 80% of Save America's total expenditures so far this year, according to financial filings. The PAC has relied almost entirely on tens of millions of dollars in returned money that Save America initially gave to pro-Trump super PAC Make America Great Again Inc., while reporting only a couple thousand dollars raised itself, Save America's filings show.\n\nIn the past few months, Save America relying on those returned contributions from MAGA Inc. for its source of funding has put something of a strain on the latter group, which was designed to spearhead a pro-Trump ad campaign operation outside of the campaign and to boost his reelection bid.\n\nThe super PAC money from MAGA Inc. to Save America is expected to dry up soon following a series of exchanges: Save America initially transferred $60 million to MAGA Inc. in 2022, but the latter group has now returned more than $50 million of those contributions back to Save America.\n\nTrump's new joint fundraising operation offers Save America PAC a fresh source of future support.\n\nMAGA Inc., meanwhile, continues to rake in tens of millions of dollars from Trump's wealthy supporters this year, filings show, but as of the end of February had $25.5 million in cash on hand -- less than half of what the super PAC had entering 2023.",

            "text": "Human trafficking is repugnant. It\u2019s a form of slavery where the trafficker uses force, fraud, or threats to make victims take part in commercial sex or forced labor. Trafficking affects thousands of people in the US every year.\n\nIt\u2019s a form of crime that Joe Biden really hates. And the Biden administration has taken many steps to stop it.\n\nThe White House recently summarized the work being done. Some of these efforts are ongoing; others are new.\n\nFirst step: increasing awareness. We need to be able to spot trafficking before we can fight it!\n\nThe Department of Labor is investing more resources in identifying forced labor and child labor risks in the products that are part of our everyday lives to ensure that we avoid importing those goods into the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will publish the National Human Trafficking Prevention Framework with violence prevention strategies and approaches for communities to stop human trafficking before it occurs, reduce its impact, and prevent it from recurring. The Department of State (State) will launch a training resource that focuses on how to conduct trauma-informed interviews and conversations for personnel at our embassies and consulates who may interview or converse with survivors of human trafficking.\n\nSecond step: protection. This involves both preventing this crime and caring for its survivors.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will select a Senior Victim-Centered Approach Official to further institutionalize victim identification and support capacity across the Department. DHS will also launch an online application and processing system for U.S. law enforcement nationwide to expedite and expand its ability to request Continued Presence for human trafficking victims. State will launch a new foreign assistance program, the Partnership to Prevent (P2P) Human Trafficking. This new program, like the Child Protection Compact Partnerships, will fund multi-year commitments developed jointly by the United States and selected partner countries. These document shared objectives to advance national and local level efforts to effectively prevent trafficking, prosecute traffickers, and provide trauma-informed care for survivors. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will support foreign governments and civil society efforts to combat human trafficking with survivor-centered approaches. HHS will continue to connect thousands of survivors of human trafficking to housing, health, and other critical services through a national network of community-based organizations.\n\nThe third big step: prosecution. The Biden administration is targeting traffickers at home and overseas.\n\nThe Department of Treasury will hold traffickers accountable by working with interagency partners to develop targeted sanctions to disrupt human trafficking activities. Since December 2022, Treasury has designated 23 persons for conduct related to human trafficking, including for serious human rights abuse aboard People\u2019s Republic of China-flagged distant water fishing vessels, and for systemic and pervasive sex trafficking activity. The Department of the Interior will continue to work with the United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices and state law enforcement officials to establish standard law enforcement response protocols throughout Indian Country. This year, the Department will also be completing a cloud-based Solution Trust Accountability Tracker (STAT). STAT catalogues information on missing persons, murder, and human trafficking cases relating to Native American and Alaska Native victims. The Department of Justice (DOJ) will continue bringing high-impact sex trafficking and labor trafficking prosecutions in partnership with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners. In addition, DOJ will launch a Human Trafficking Strategic Initiative of the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force. It will mobilize additional federal, state, and local law enforcement partners in investigations involving transnational organized and gang-related human trafficking threats.\n\nIs there still more work to be done? 100%! Lots more work. But Biden has done so much more than many people guessed could be done. He deserves a lot of credit. AND he deserves to be re-elected.\n\nWhat can you do to help?\n\nYour donation will come bundled with others from our Good News community and will show Biden that there are many of us who support him and combine hard work with optimism in our battles for a better America!\n\nWant to do something else?\n\nRec and comment on these posts to keep them alive at DKos and share them with others who might not realize how great a president Joe Biden has been.\n\nLooking for something else? Here are some other ideas:\n\nThis is an entry in my ongoing series Boosting Biden.\n\nCheck the comments for more information on how to find other entries and subscribe.\n\nThese posts are written by GoodNewsRoundup (Goodie),\n\nedited by Matilda Briggs, and supported by 2thanks and WolverineForTJatAW\n\nas well as several other notable Kossacks.\n\nAs with all good things, it takes a village.",

            "text": "Biden Campaign Mocks Trump\u2019s Low Fundraising Figures, Suggesting He Would Terminate Himself\n\nThe Biden campaign celebrated on Wednesday the significant fundraising success and financial advantage it holds over the Trump campaign.\n\nFormer President Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign reported a significant influx of funds in the past month, with a total of $10.9 million being brought in. Additionally, his joint fundraising committee managed to raise nearly $11 million during the same period. As of March, the campaign had approximately $42 million in cash available. These figures demonstrate the continued support and financial backing for Trump\u2019s future political endeavors.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s campaign operation outperformed those figures significantly. In the month of February alone, they managed to raise an impressive $53 million. As a result, they now have a whopping $155 million in cash on hand as they enter the month of March.\n\nAt BestReviews, we value our readers and want to provide them with the best recommendations.

As of the end of February, the RNC reported having approximately $11 million in available funds, which falls short of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s $26 million.\n\nThe former president, Trump, has been incurring significant legal fees due to his trial for four separate crimes, exacerbating the situation. He also has to pay a $454 million judgment soon because a judge in New York found that he lied about his assets to get tax and insurance benefits and was guilty of theft.\n\nWith interest piling on an additional $112,000 each day Trump doesn\u2019t pay, the former president owes the state about $457 million as of Wednesday.\n\nBiden will end his three-day trip to Nevada, Arizona, and Texas on Thursday. During that time, he held three events. Next week, he will be in New York City with former Presidents Obama and Clinton for a big benefit.\n\nReference Article",

            "text": "Authored by The American Institute for Economic Research,\n\nYoung people sometimes seem to wake up in the morning in search of something to be outraged about. We are among the wealthiest and most educated humans in history. But we\u2019re increasingly convinced that we\u2019re worse off than our parents were, that the planet is in crisis, and that it\u2019s probably not worth having kids.\n\nI\u2019ll generalize here about my own cohort (people born after 1981 but before 2010), commonly referred to as Millennials and Gen Z, as that shorthand corresponds to survey and demographic data. Millennials and Gen Z have valid economic complaints, and the conditions of our young adulthood perceptibly weakened traditional bridges to economic independence. We graduated with record amounts of student debt after President Obama nationalized that lending. Housing prices doubled during our household formation years due to zoning impediments and chronic underbuilding. Young Americans say economic issues are important to us, and candidates are courting our votes by promising student debt relief and cheaper housing (which they will never be able to deliver).\n\n\n\nYoung people, in our idealism and our rational ignorance of the actual appropriations process, typically support more government intervention, more spending programs, and more of every other burden that has landed us in such untenable economic circumstances to begin with. Perhaps not coincidentally, young people who\u2019ve spent the most years in the increasingly partisan bubble of higher education are also the most likely to favor expanded government programs as a \u201csolution\u201d to those complaints.\n\nIt\u2019s Your Debt, Boomer\n\nWhat most young people don\u2019t yet understand is that we are sacrificing our young adulthood and our financial security to pay for debts run up by Baby Boomers. Part of every Millennial and Gen-Z paycheck is payable to people the same age as the members of Congress currently milking this system and miring us further in debt.\n\nOur government spends more than it can extract from taxpayers. Social Security, which represents 20 percent of government spending, has run an annual deficit for 15 years. Last year Social Security alone overspent by $22.1 billion. To keep sending out checks to retirees, Social Security goes begging to the Treasury Department, and the Treasury borrows from the public by issuing bonds. Bonds allow investors (who are often also taxpayers) to pay for some retirees\u2019 benefits now, and be paid back later. But investors only volunteer to lend Social Security the money it needs to cover its bills because the (younger) taxpayers will eventually repay the debt \u2014 with interest.\n\n\n\nIn other words, both Social Security and Medicare, along with various smaller federal entitlement programs, together comprising almost half of the federal budget, have been operating for a decade on the principle of \u201cgive us the money now, and stick the next generation with the check.\u201d We saddle future generations with debt for present-day consumption.\n\n\n\nThe second largest item in the budget after Social Security is interest on the national debt \u2014 largely on Social Security and other entitlements that have already been spent. These mandatory benefits now consume three quarters of the federal budget: even Congress is not answerable for these programs. We never had the chance for our votes to impact that spending (not that older generations were much better represented) and it\u2019s unclear if we ever will.\n\n\n\nYoung Americans probably don\u2019t think much about the budget deficit (each year\u2019s overspending) or the national debt (many years\u2019 deficits put together, plus interest) much at all. And why should we? For our entire political memory, the federal government, as well as most of our state governments, have been steadily piling \u201cpublic\u201d debt upon our individual and collective heads. That\u2019s just how it is. We are the frogs trying to make our way in the watery world as the temperature ticks imperceptibly higher. We have been swimming in debt forever, unaware that we\u2019re being economically boiled alive.\n\nMillennials have somewhat modest non-mortgage debt of around $27,000 (some self-reports say twice that much), including car notes, student loans, and credit cards. But we each owe more than $100,000 as a share of the national debt. And we don\u2019t even know it.\n\n\n\nWhen Millennials finally do have babies (and we are!) that infant born in 2024 will enter the world with a newly minted Social Security Number and $78,089 credit card bill for Granddad\u2019s heart surgery and the interest on a benefit check that was mailed when her parents were in middle school.\n\nHeadlines and comments sections love to sneer at \u201csnowflakes\u201d who\u2019ve just hit the \u201creal world,\u201d and can\u2019t figure out how to make ends meet, but the kids are onto something. A full 15 percent of our earnings are confiscated to pay into retirement and healthcare programs that will be insolvent by the time we\u2019re old enough to enjoy them. The Federal Reserve and government debt are eating the economy. The same interest rates that are pushing mortgages out of reach are driving up the cost of interest to maintain the debt going forward. As we learn to save and invest, our dollars are slowly devalued. We\u2019re right to feel trapped.\n\nSure, if we\u2019re alive and own a smartphone, we\u2019re among the one percent of the wealthiest humans who\u2019ve ever lived. Older generations could argue (persuasively!) that we have no idea what \u201cpoverty\u201d is anymore. But with the state of government spending and debt\u2026we are likely to find out.\n\nDespite being richer than Rockefeller, Millennials are right to say that the previous ways of building income security have been pushed out of reach. Our earning years are subsidizing not our own economic coming-of-age, but bank bailouts, wars abroad, and retirement and medical benefits for people who navigated a less-challenging wealth-building landscape.\n\nRedistribution goes both ways. Boomers are expected to pass on tens of trillions in unprecedented wealth to their children (if it isn\u2019t eaten up by medical costs, despite heavy federal subsidies) and older generations\u2019 financial support of the younger has had palpable lifting effects. Half of college costs are paid by families, and the trope of young people moving back home is only possible if mom and dad have the spare room and groceries to make that feasible.\n\nGovernment \u201chelp\u201d during COVID-19 resulted in the worst inflation in 40 years, as the federal government spent $42,000 per citizen on \u201cstimulus\u201d efforts, right around a Millennial\u2019s average salary at that time. An absurd amount of fraud was perpetrated in the stimulus to save an economy from the lockdown that nearly ruined it. Trillions in earmarked goodies were rubber stamped, carelessly added to young people\u2019s growing bill. Government lenders deliberately removed fraud controls, fearing they couldn\u2019t hand out $800 billion in young people\u2019s future wages away fast enough. Important lessons were taught by those programs. The importance of self-sufficiency and the dignity of hard work weren\u2019t top of the list.\n\nBoomer Benefits are Stagnating Hiring, Wages, and Investment for Young People\n\nEven if our workplace engagement suffered under government distortions, Millennials continue to work more hours than other generations and invest in side hustles and self employment at higher rates. Working hard and winning higher wages almost doesn\u2019t matter, though, when our purchasing power is eaten from the other side. Buying power has dropped 20 percent in just five years. Life is $11,400/year more expensive than it was two years ago and deficit spending is the reason why.\n\nWe\u2019re having trouble getting hired for what we\u2019re worth, because it costs employers 30 percent more than just our wages to employ us. The federal tax code both requires and incentivizes our employers to transfer a bunch of what we earned directly to insurance companies and those same Boomer-busted federal benefits, via tax-deductible benefits and payroll taxes. And the regulatory compliance costs of ravenous bureaucratic state. The price paid by each employer to keep each employee continues to rise \u2014 but Congress says your boss has to give most of the increase to someone other than you.\n\nFederal spending programs that many people consider good government, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance for children (CHIP) aren\u2019t a small amount of the federal budget. Government spends on these programs because people support and demand them, and because cutting those benefits would be a re-election death sentence. That\u2019s why they call cutting Social Security the \u201cthird rail of politics.\u201d If you touch those benefits, you die. Congress is held hostage by Baby Boomers who are running up the bill with no sign of slowing down.\n\nYoung people generally support Social Security and the public health insurance programs, even though a 2021 poll by Nationwide Financial found 47 percent of Millennials agree with the statement \u201cI will not get a dime of the Social Security benefits I have earned.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the same survey, Millennials were the most likely of any generation to believe that Social Security benefits should be enough to live on as a sole income, and guessed the retirement age was 52 (it\u2019s 67 for anyone born after 1959 \u2014 and that\u2019s likely to rise). Young people are the most likely to see government guarantees as a valid way to live \u2014 even though we seem to understand that those promises aren\u2019t guarantees at all.\n\nHealthcare costs tied to an aging population and wonderful-but-expensive growth in medical technologies and medications will balloon over the next few years, and so will the deficits in Boomer benefit programs. Newly developed obesity drugs alone are expected to add $13.6 billion to Medicare spending. By 2030, every single Baby Boomer will be 65, eligible for publicly funded healthcare.\n\nThe first Millennial will be eligible to claim Medicare (assuming the program exists and the qualifying age is still 65, both of which are improbable) in 2046. As it happens, that\u2019s also the year that the Boomer benefits programs (which will then be bloated with Gen Xers) and the interest payments we\u2019re incurring to provide those benefits now, are projected to consume 100 percent of federal tax revenue.\n\nGovernment spending is being transferred to bureaucrats and then to the beneficiaries of government spending who are, in some sense, your diabetic grandma who needs a Medicare-paid dialysis treatment, but in a much more immediate sense, are the insurance companies, pharma giants, and hospital corporations who wrote the healthcare legislation. Some percentage of every college graduate\u2019s paycheck buys bullets that get fired at nothing and inflating the private investment portfolios of government contractors, with dubious, wasteful outcomes from the prison-industrial complex to the perpetual war machine.\n\nNo bank or nation in the world can lend the kind of money the American government needs to borrow to fulfill its obligations to citizens. Someone will have to bite the bullet. Even some of the co-authors of the current disaster are wrestling with the truth.\n\nForget avocado toast and streaming subscriptions. We\u2019re already sensing it, but we haven\u2019t yet seen it. Young people are not well-informed, and often actively misled, about what\u2019s rotten in this economic system. But we are seeing the consequences on store shelves and mortgage contracts and we can sense disaster is coming. We\u2019re about to get stuck with the bill.",

            "text": "The U.S. Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the U.S. government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.\n\nThe complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that \u201dApple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,\u201d he added.\n\nThe long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling \u2013 and in some cases, restricting \u2013 how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth\u2019s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.\n\nThe company said it denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d\n\nBut Garland on Thursday said Apple\u2019s actions have wide-ranging effects.\n\n\u201cMonopolies like Apple\u2019s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,\u201d Garland said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there\u2019s a law for that,\u201d he added.\n\nFor example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message \u2013 but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.\n\nThe company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors\u2019 products are far more limited in their capabilities.\n\n\u201cApple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,\u201d Garland said on Thursday.\n\n\u2018We will vigorously defend against it\u2019\n\nThis year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.\n\nAnd Apple maintains a 30 per cent commission on most sales through its app store \u2013 a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple\u2019s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\n\nThursday\u2019s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.\n\nApple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2013 designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\u201d the company said in its statement. \u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\u201d\n\nYears of scrutiny\n\nApple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple\u2019s practices.\n\nThe case represents the Biden administration\u2019s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under U.S. antitrust law.\n\nApple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.\n\nThe legal action could weigh on Apple\u2019s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell 3 per cent Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.\n\nAlong with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.\n\nThe Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden\u2019s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.\n\nAlong with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.\n\nApps vs Apple\n\nTo solve Android phone customers\u2019 \u201cgreen bubble\u201d issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.\n\n\u201cIt lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,\u201d Migicovsky said. \u201cTechnologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.\u201d\n\nThose kind of interactions have made Apple\u2019s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.\n\nBeginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game \u201cFortnite.\u201d\n\nApple isn\u2019t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.\n\nThose rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don\u2019t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.\n\nEurope\u2019s bite at Apple\n\nThe U.S. government isn\u2019t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.\n\nIn a seismic move to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.\n\nBut critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.\n\nUpstart turned behemoth\n\nSince its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It\u2019s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple\u2019s restrictiveness.\n\nIn the era led by founder Steve Jobs, \u201cApple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,\u201d said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. \u201cApple relentlessly innovated. They were always steps ahead of the competition.\u201d\n\nNow, however, Apple\u2019s advances are more \u201cincremental\u201d than earth-shattering, Bailey added. \u201c[CEO Tim] Cook has been focused on financial management and expanding market share.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s financially healthy,\u201d Bailey said, but their reputation for innovation is \u201cdimming.\u201d",

It will fill a critical electricity generation gap following Pennsylvania\u2019s largest coal plant\u2018s closure in July 2023.\n\nRenewables developer Swift Current Energy (SCE) will build a utility-scale 402 MW solar farm capable of producing enough clean energy to power 75,000 homes. SCE says on Mineral Basin\u2019s website that it\u2019s considering adopting offsite battery energy storage for the project.\n\nMineral Basin will serve as a pilot for SCE, which plans to develop around 1,000 MW of solar on former coal mine sites in the Appalachian region over the next five years.\n\nThe federal funding for the solar farm was announced today by the US Department of Energy and came from money already earmarked by the Biden administration\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nSecretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said, \u201cThanks to the President\u2019s Investing in America agenda, DOE is helping deploy clean energy solutions on current and former mine land across the country \u2013 supporting jobs and economic development in the areas hit hardest by our evolving energy landscape.\u201d\n\nThe project expects to create more than 750 construction jobs and six operations jobs, while providing $1.1 million in annual tax revenue to townships, the county, and local school district.\n\nConstruction on Pennsylvania\u2019s largest solar farm could begin this summer, and it\u2019s expected to come online by the second half of 2026. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) awarded it a 20-year power purchase agreement in November 2023.\n\nMineral Basin Solar Power, LLC, says it will invest nearly $20 million in economic development to create opportunities for young people and adults who want to upskill, right-skill, and reskill across high-demand sectors in the 27-county region.\n\nTo limit power outages and make your home more resilient, consider going solar with a battery storage system.

            "text": "Four years after the Covid pandemic sent America into a standstill, President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is looking to co-opt a common question posed by former President Donald Trump and his allies: \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d\n\nTrump asked his 6.7 million followers on Truth Social that question earlier this week, using it to drive contrasts between Biden and Trump\u2019s records on the economy and the border. But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time, and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the crisis.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, 'Are you better off today than you were yesterday?' Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday.\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and his allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt cited higher mortgage rates, illegal border crossings, the war in Ukraine and other foreign conflicts to argue the U.S. was better off under Trump prior to Covid-19.\n\n\u201cAmericans know Biden has been a disaster and they were far better off under President Trump, which is why President Trump continues to crush Biden in the polls,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

            "text": "was \u201ccrypto,\u201d now \u201conchain\u201d\n\nOn the Unchained podcast on Friday, host Laura Shin wisely noticed that her guest \u2013 Coinbase\u2019s Jesse Pollak, who originally created his company\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain Base \u2013 was using the term \u201conchain\u201d rather than \u201ccrypto\u201d in the course of their conversation on the latest Ethereum upgrade.\n\nShe asked him why \u201conchain\u201d and not \u201ccrypto\u201d? He replied in part (edited):\n\n\u201c(\u2026) The thing that I think is really powerful is\u2026 instead of hearing \u2018crypto\u2019 or \u2018web3\u2019 and thinking about speculation, pump and dump and all of this legacy of the crypto industry that has really been driven by speculation for the last decade\u2026 people hear \u2018onchain,\u2019 they get to see it in a new light, they get to analogize it to \u2018online\u2019 \u2013 which is this thing that has transformed their lives over the last 20 years \u2013 and they see it first and foremost as a technology.\n\nThey say, \u2018If I come onchain, I can earn more money for my business or I can cut out the middlemen who are taking my creative work and profiting off of it. Or I can play this new game that wasn\u2019t previously possible, or I can collaborate and send money to anyone in the world instantly and for free\u2026.\n\nThose are not about speculation, it\u2019s not about making more money, it\u2019s about taking a technology and making your life better. I think that is the theme of onchain \u2013 it\u2019s about upgrading our systems.\n\nIt\u2019s about acknowledging that a lot of the stuff we\u2019ve been doing with money is built on systems that are 50-100 years old. And if we use technology, software, blockchains to build new experiences and to bring the world onchain, we actually make everyone\u2019s life better.\n\n(\u2026) Our mantra for the industry is that it\u2019s time for change. And it\u2019s time for us to embrace this new language \u2013 the language of \u2018onchain\u2019 \u2013 that really centers crypto as a technology change that is upgrading our systems to make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nmore tips:\n\n\u201cHow Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade could lead to the rise of millions of Layer 3s\u201d (podcast) \u2013 Unchained\n\n\n\nwhat you should know: In addition to a mantra, Pollak\u2019s response could be the leading edge of a maturation for an industry. For cynics, the view could be that Pollak\u2019s serving another cupful of wishful crypto thinking.\n\ndigital assets taxes\n\nIn his Friday newsletter, Cap Hill Crypto\u2019s George Leonardo dissected the Biden Administration\u2019s new 2025 budget proposal which could impact digital assets. Leonardo writes, \u201cLike last year, the Budget proposes a tax on energy used for mining and several updates to the existing tax code aimed at incorporating digital assets.\u201d\n\nHe reviews the \u201cDigital Asset Mining Excise Tax\u201d and notes, \u201cThe Budget proposes a new tax on energy used for digital asset mining. Specifically, mining firms would have to pay a tax equal to 30% of the costs of electricity used for mining. The tax would be phased in over three years, with a rate of 10% in the first year, 20% in the second year, and 30% each year thereafter\u2026\u201d\n\nRead the Cap Hill Crypto breakdown.\n\nRep. Hill running\n\nPunchbowl News\u2019 The Vault newsletter reports that House Financial Services (HFS) Committee Vice Chair and Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion Chair French Hill (R, AR) is definitively running for the head of the HFS Republican caucus saying, \u201cCommunications Director Brooke Nethercott confirmed to us that Hill is in the running for the committee job overseeing Wall Street and the federal financial regulators.\u201d Read more (subscription).\n\nwhat you should know: It\u2019s a good sign for digital assets aficionados, but with the dwindling momentum for the majority House Republicans in the November general election, who controls the HFS agenda looks increasingly in question.\n\ncampaign finance\n\nCoinciding with pro-crypto super PACs expressing their interest in the primary, two candidates in the Maryland Senate primary have announced they are pro-crypto. Politico\u2019s Jasper Goodman reports that one of the candidates, Rep. John Trone (D), was one of 100 Democrat co-signers of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D, MA) October 17 letter to the White House and U.S. Treasury expressing concern about crypto\u2019s connection to the financing of terrorism and Hamas in light of the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel.\n\nTrone tells Politico he supports new digital assets regulation and adds, \u201cWe cannot let the U.S. fall behind in the global race for technological advancement and economic competitiveness.\u201d Read more.\n\nwhat you should know: Trone\u2019s House Committee appointments (Appropriations, Joint Economic Committee and Budget Committee) in the 118th Congress have been outside of the House\u2019s digital assets discussion in Financial Services and Agriculture. If the digital asset market structure bill [H.R.4763] can make it to the House Floor before the August Congressional recess, it will be interesting to see how he and other Dems would vote \u2013 especially with campaign \u201ckibble\u201d from Super PACs potentially waiting for them.\n\nuse case \u2013 DLT for finance\n\nA new study from Broadridge, a multi-billion dollar, public, fintech infrastructure company, says that distributed ledger technology investment is nearly matching the increase in investment in artificial intelligence (AI) by the world\u2019s financial industry today. See the report.\n\nLedger Insights covers the report and observes, \u201cOne of the questions asked whether DLT would reduce the need for custodians and clearinghouses for post-trade and issuance. Thirty-six percent of respondents agreed.\u201d Read the summary.\n\ncentralized decentralization\n\nIn the Financial Times, reporter Josh Oliver offers a long opinion piece on what\u2019s wrong with crypto. In the process, he offers a bulleted list beginning with centralization: \u201cTechnical explanations will almost always tell you that crypto\u2019s key attribute is that it is decentralised. It is not.

His administration\u2019s inaction on high-interest rates and the rising cost of living have made it difficult for working-class families to own a home. And yet, he has the audacity to blame President Trump for these issues.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to win over voters, Biden promised a $10,000 mortgage relief tax credit and a $10,000 tax credit for those selling their homes. But how does he plan to fund these handouts?\n\nOf course, Biden will increase taxes on hardworking Americans. It\u2019s obvious his solution to every problem is to throw more money at it rather than implement sound economic policies that have proven successful under President Trump.\n\nBiden also called on real estate brokerages to \u201clower commissions,\u201d conveniently ignoring that the National Association of Realtors agreed to resolve an antitrust lawsuit just last week.\n\nIn Arizona, Biden spoke at a Mexican restaurant in a blatant attempt to appeal to Latino voters. He knows that he needs their support if he wants to win battleground states, but his charm offensive can\u2019t hide the fact that he flip-flopped on key issues, such as immigration and trade, to pander to his base.\n\nBiden is panicking as Trump\u2019s approval ratings continue to rise. It seems many on both sides of the fence are not happy with Biden. Some left-wing voters have even launched an \u201cAbandon Biden\u201d movement, urging voters to support an obscure author in the Democratic primary.",

Honestly, too often local folks don\u2019t even know! So we are going to celebrate some of those things here. Feel free to Kosmail me if you have ideas from your area.\n\nNow, of course, Illinois is an amazing state that didn\u2019t need \u201csaving.\u201d But as we are rolling with the superhero theme, please allow me some poetic license.\n\nWhat has he done for Illinois? A lot \u2014 from the very start. How about this:\n\nBetween January 2021 and June 2022, the Illinois economy added 309,900 jobs (5.4 percent of January 2021 employment in Illinois). The state economy recovered 83 percent of the jobs lost between February 2020 and April 2020. Residents of Illinois applied to start more new businesses during President Biden\u2019s first year in office than in any other year since the series started in 2005.\n\nAnd this, from August 2022:\n\nIllinois to Begin Work Plugging More Than 600 Orphaned Wells Through President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\n\nThe Department of the Interior today announced that Illinois has been awarded an initial grant of $25 million from President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to begin work to plug, cap and reclaim orphaned oil and gas wells across the state. Millions of Americans across the country live within a mile of an orphaned oil and gas well. The state of Illinois has indicated that it will use this funding to plug between 600 to 800 documented wells. Funds will also be used to measure and track methane emissions and contamination in groundwater and surface water. Additionally, this funding will allow Illinois to expand its well-plugging capacity with the purchase of safety equipment, computers, vehicles, gas detectors, and a Forward Looking InfraRed camera, among other items. All of these will be used to plug documented wells and locate undocumented wells throughout the state that will be plugged with Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding in the upcoming years. Millions of Americans across the country live within a mile of an orphaned oil and gas well, which are polluting backyards, recreation areas and community spaces across the country. Methane leaking from many of these unplugged wells is a serious safety hazard and is a significant cause of climate change, being more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. The historic investments to clean up these hazardous sites will create good-paying, union jobs, catalyze economic growth and revitalization, and reduce dangerous methane leaks.\n\nAnd this, from November 2023:\n\nBiden-Harris Administration Announces $336 Million Loan to Chicago to Help Remove 30,000 Lead Pipes Across the City\n\nToday, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox announced a $336 million Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan to the City of Chicago. With help from this financing, the water department will replace up to 30,000 lead pipes that deliver water to homes across the city while creating an estimated 2,700 jobs. This action marks a significant step toward replacing all lead service lines\u2014a goal that is shared by the Biden Administration, the State of Illinois, and the City of Chicago. The Administration announced this WIFIA loan at a lead service line removal site in Chicago, Illinois, with U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, and additional community leaders and stakeholders. \u201cWhether you are a resident of Chicago or any city across this nation, no person should worry if their water is safe to drink or if it will harm their children. With EPA\u2019s $336 million loan, the City of Chicago will replace up to 30,000 lead pipes so that more local residents can rest assured that their water is safe,\u201d said EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Administration is committed to removing all lead pipes across this country,\u201d she continued, \u201cand EPA is using every tool available to address this public health issue. We are strengthening our regulations, investing in lead pipe replacement programs with $15 billion in dedicated funding under the President\u2019s Investing in America agenda, and we are prioritizing lead pipe removal under this program.\u201d The City of Chicago will use the WIFIA loan to help with replacing lead service lines serving single family homes and small multi-unit buildings citywide whenever there is a leak or break on a lead line or when performing water and sewer main updates. Although Chicago\u2019s water is in compliance with state and federal safety regulations, the City is committed to replacing all the legacy lead lines to help ensure that the water system is lead-free for generations to come.\n\nand this, from later in the same month:\n\nBiden says workers need \u2018a fair shot\u2019 as he celebrates the labor deal saving an Illinois auto plant\n\nPresident Joe Biden put on a red United Auto Workers shirt on Thursday as he celebrated a labor deal that will reopen the Stellantis plant in Belvidere, Illinois, treating the factory\u2019s salvation as a vindication of his decision to stand with striking union members as they demanded higher wages. \u201cAmerican workers are ready to work harder than anyone else,\u201d Biden told cheering autoworkers in a community center in the northern Illinois city. \u201cBut they just need to be given a shot. A fair shot and a fair wage.\u201d He praised the union members as \u201cas tough, tough, tough as they come.\u201d Someone in the audience shouted to the president, \u201cThat shirt looks good on you.\u201d\n\nand this, from just last month:\n\nBiden-Harris Administration Announces $76 Million to Revitalize Coal Communities, Create Good-Paying Jobs in Illinois\n\nAs part of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Investing in America tour, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Dr. Steve Feldgus and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Principal Deputy Director Sharon Buccino traveled to Illinois today, where they announced $75.8 million in fiscal year 2023 funding from President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda to address dangerous and polluting abandoned mine lands and catalyze economic opportunity in Illinois. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda gives us an unparalleled investment and opportunity to address the majority of currently known abandoned mine land hazards,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Feldgus. \u201cThrough these new historic resources, the Interior Department is addressing long-standing environmental injustices, cleaning up toxic and hazardous sites and creating jobs and revitalizing former coal communities.\u201d [. . .] Millions of Americans nationwide live less than a mile from an abandoned coal mine. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated a total of $16 billion to address legacy pollution, including $11.3 billion in abandoned mine land funding over 15 years, facilitated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. This historic funding is expected to address the majority of currently inventoried abandoned coal mine lands in the nation.\n\nAnd finally this, just a couple of weeks ago:\n\nEPA announces cleanup will begin at the Asarco Taylor Springs Superfund site in Illinois as part of President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced a third and final wave of more than $1 billion for cleanup projects at more than 100 Superfund sites across the country as part of President Biden\u2019s Investing in America agenda. This funding is made possible by the President\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and will launch new cleanup projects at 25 Superfund sites, including the Asarco Taylor Springs Superfund site in Taylor Springs, Ill. \u201cAlongside Illinois\u2019 rich industrial history lies the sobering reality of polluted sites that pose significant risks to public health and the environment,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin. \u201cThis federal funding is critical in our mission to restore contaminated sites for the benefit of every Illinois resident.\u201d \u201cEliminating contaminated sites is an important part of protecting the health of children and families,\u201d said Sen. Tammy Duckworth. \u201cAnd it is also a necessary part of helping spur development, job creation and economic growth for affected communities.\u201d \u201cRehabilitating polluted properties is critical in our efforts to revitalize underserved communities and drive economic growth,\u201d said Rep. Nikki Budzinski. \u201cIn Springfield, the Moving Pillsbury Forward project has shown us the promise that Superfund site resources have in transforming neighborhoods that have been left behind for too long.\u201d\n\nIs there still more work to be done? 100%! Lots more work. But Biden did more than many people guessed could be done. He deserves a lot of credit.

            "text": "On April 7, 1992, then-Senator Joe Biden criticized those who interfered in Israel\u2019s affairs.\n\nHe declared: \u201cThe absurd notion that publicly vilifying Israel will somehow change its policy; who in the hell do we think we\u2019re dealing with? What makes us think, even if the administration is 100% correct on the policy, what makes them think that in the midst of an election campaign, in the midst of a so-called peace talk, that we can publicly vilify a nation, persons, and think that a leader is going to say, now I will yield before the world and God, because I\u2019ve been told? What in the hell do we think we\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden noted, \u201cWhy, why is there any incentive for the Arabs to make any compromise, any compromise, in the peace talks? Why, if they know that they must only wait for the United States to do their bargaining for them? Why would they compromise? Why would they be reasonable?\u201d\n\nInterestingly, James Baker was serving as secretary of state at the time. Baker is infamous for his comment \u201cF\u2014 the Jews, they don\u2019t vote for us anyway.\u201d Baker\u2019s comments proved a self-fulfilling prophecy. His boss, President George H.W. Bush, went from 35% of the Jewish vote in 1988 to 12% in the 1992 election, which he lost to Bill Clinton.\n\nBaker wasn\u2019t the first to make such a miscalculation. President Jimmy Carter\u2019s Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan warned Carter that his policies towards Israel would alienate American Jews. Carter ignored him and went from 71% of the Jewish vote in 1976 to 45% in the 1980 election he lost to Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\nToday, President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer appear to have adopted the same failed strategy, except to them, the watchword is, in effect: F\u2014 the Jews, they\u2019ll vote for us anyway. But just as Baker and Carter were wrong to discount the Jewish vote, those who do so now to justify policies hostile to Israel do so at their own peril.\n\nBy strange coincidence, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman is again playing a major role in all this. Back in the early \u201890s, Friedman played tennis with Baker and served as the press mouthpiece for Baker\u2019s policy of blaming Israel for the lack of Middle East peace. At the time, Baker and Bush were pressuring then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to forgo his insistence on bilateral negotiations. They did so by threatening to withhold U.S. loan guarantees intended to assist Israel in absorbing a million olim from the Soviet Union.\n\nToday, Friedman is once again a mouthpiece, this time for the Biden administration\u2019s policy of attacking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel\u2019s defensive war against Hamas. Rather than insist on Hamas surrendering and releasing all the hostages\u2014including the American ones\u2014which would end the war immediately, the administration is more interested in pandering to a few thousand Muslim voters in swing states who hate Israel and often support Hamas. This is an offensive and self-destructive policy.\n\nThere are already strong signs that, as a result of his misguided approach, Biden is hemorrhaging Jewish support. A Sienna poll of New York voters found former President Donald Trump winning the Jewish vote by a wide margin. This is in keeping with the results of the 2020 election, which saw Trump\u2019s share of Florida\u2019s Jewish voters rise from 23% in 2016 to 41%.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of American Jews and Americans in general support Israel and disdain Hamas. The exponential rise in antisemitic incidents and failure of Biden\u2019s vaunted plan to combat antisemitism, as well as his failure even to mention the problem in his State of the Union address are also leading many Jews to drop their support for Biden.\n\nIn 1992, Friedman and Baker inadvertently undermined Jewish support for the Republican Party. Friedman and Biden are now doing the same to the Democrats. History demonstrates that sitting presidents who turn on Israel always end up in failure and defeat.\n\n\n\nImage - Reuters",

            "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) today joined Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) to introduce the Protecting Access to Credit for Small Businesses Act, a bill that would prevent the Biden administration from using the Small Business Administration (SBA) as a direct lender for the 7(a) Loan Program.\n\n\u201cFraud and inefficiency characterize the Small Business Administration\u2019s history in direct lending. The government shouldn\u2019t crowd out private lenders that are already doing a good job getting funds to the small businesses that need them. I\u2019m proud to partner with Sen. Scott to stop the SBA from replacing private lenders and those in our communities with Washington bureaucrats,\u201d said Kennedy.\n\n\u201cWhen acting as a direct lender, the SBA has a consistent history of failure and inefficiency when compared to the private sector. The administration\u2019s proposal is just a vehicle for a big government overreach into nearly all aspects of American life and private institutions. There\u2019s simply no reason to use the federal government to funnel tax dollars that will later be loaned back to small businesses,\u201d said Scott.\n\nThe Protecting Access to Credit for Small Businesses Act would block the SBA from issuing direct 7(a) loans and competing with small lenders.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe 7(a) Loan Program provides small businesses with loans of up to $5 million to help job creators grow and maintain their businesses. Today, small business owners work with private lenders in their communities to receive loans through the program.\n\nIn his 2025 budget request, President Biden proposed a small-dollar lending program that would allow the SBA to issue 7(a) program loans directly, forcing small lenders to compete with the federal government.\n\nDemocrats attempted to implement a similar direct lending option for the SBA in 2021. Kennedy, Scott and a dozen other Republicans wrote a letter warning that the federal government has a history of developing botched lending programs. The SBA\u2019s Inspector General, for example, estimated that the government-run Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program issued $79 billion in fraudulent loans during the pandemic. Businesses also suffered lengthy delays while waiting for EIDL funding.\n\nPrivate lenders have a far better record of efficiently and safely distributing loans to small businesses. Under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), private banks distributed $800 billion in loans to nearly 12 million small businesses. Fraud experts identified fewer than 1% of accounts as potentially fraudulent.\n\nSens. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.) also cosponsored the legislation.\n\nFull text of the Protecting Access to Credit for Small Businesses Act is available here.",

The prospect of criminal referrals has injected a new dimension of intensity into the contentious inquiry.\n\nBiden's Business Dealings via ABC The House Oversight Committee's investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings could result in \"criminal referrals\" to the Department of Justice, according to Committee Chair James Comer.\n\nDiscrepancies via NBC \u201cI think that we\u2019re at the point in the investigation where we need to hear the discrepancies,\u201d Comer said. \u201cI fully expect Hunter Biden to show up. If he [Hunter] does not show up, then it\u2019s not going to end well for the Bidens, because we have three witnesses \u2026 that have already testified under oath to significantly different stories as to what exactly the Biden influence peddling schemes were,\u201d he said.\n\nEvidence of wrongdoing via NBC \u201cThis is very serious because we\u2019re at the point now of criminal referrals,\u201d Comer said. Comer and other Republicans like Gaetz, Issa, and Higgins have said the investigation has found evidence of wrongdoing and influence peddling by the Biden family, though the standards for impeachment are high.\n\nBiden legal team via NBC \u201cWe have spent a year investigating this. We have faced massive obstruction from the White House, from the Biden legal team, yet we have been able to get probably 80 percent of the information that we have requested,\u201d Comer said. \u201cWe have accumulated lots of evidence of wrongdoing. I can\u2019t tell you a single legitimate business the Bidens had, other than they were influence peddling,\u201d Comer added.\n\n\n\nBiden's Fate via NBC They maintain criminal referrals are a better option than impeachment, and that ultimately voters will decide Biden's fate in the 2024 election. Some Republicans argue this would be a symbolic move with little accountability, while others believe referrals could spur action if Republicans regain control of the DOJ after the 2024 election.\n\nPotential criminal referrals via NBC The House Oversight Committee's relentless pursuit of the impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden has reached a critical juncture, with Rep. James Comer signaling a strategic shift towards exploring potential criminal referrals related to the Biden family's business dealings.\n\n'He deserves them' via CBS \u201cHe [Joe Biden] deserves them,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz said of the criminal referrals. \u201cI don\u2019t think that a sufficient number of Republicans hold the view I do that a bribe can be consummated through a payment to a family member,\u201d Gaetz added. \u201cThe D.O.J. is about to change hands \u2026 It\u2019s about to be under new management.\u201d\n\nMake a decision via NBC \u201cIf our investigation reveals that impeachment is not a righteous pursuit, perhaps a criminal referral is,\u201d Rep. Clay Higgins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much heavier lift for impeachment,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I would say that no matter what the Oversight Committee does, the American people are going to have an opportunity in November to make a decision.\u201d\n\nRefused to testify via ABC Hunter Biden has refused to testify publicly after initially agreeing to do so. The absence of Hunter Biden, the panel's star witness, from a public hearing, despite his prior private testimony, has set the stage for Rep. Comer's assertion that \"it's not going to end well for the Bidens.\" This statement, coupled with the indication of \"multiple criminal referrals,\" has underscored the escalating stakes and the potential ramifications of the inquiry's trajectory.\n\nLeveraged their family via NBC The committee's narrative revolves around assertions that the Bidens leveraged their family name for influence-peddling, alleging a web of connections and interactions that seek to implicate Joe Biden in his son's business dealings. The focus on alleged discrepancies and influence-peddling has laid the groundwork for the potential pursuit of criminal referrals within the inquiry.\n\nDivergent reactions via CBS As the inquiry navigates the political landscape, the prospect of criminal referrals has elicited divergent reactions, with implications resonating beyond the confines of the committee's proceedings. The delicate balance of political pressure, public perception, and the intricacies of the impeachment inquiry has fueled a narrative of heightened significance and far-reaching implications.\n\nEscalating tensions via NBC Amid the escalating tensions and the potential trajectory of the inquiry, unresolved questions linger about the specific nature of the potential criminal referrals, the individuals who may be targeted, and the possible offenses under scrutiny. The evolving dynamics of the inquiry and the looming specter of criminal referrals have left the political landscape in a state of anticipation and speculation.\n\nComer's indication via NBC Rep. James Comer's indication of possible 'criminal referrals' from the Biden impeachment inquiry has injected a new layer of complexity and intensity into the proceedings.",

            "text": "Republikaner machen Biden f\u00fcr Afghanistan-Fiasko verantwortlich\n\nDrucken Teilen\n\nDer katastrophale Truppenabzug des US-Milit\u00e4rs aus Afghanistan wird Joe Biden auch Jahre sp\u00e4ter noch zum Verh\u00e4ngnis. Eine erneute Anh\u00f6rung im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus bringt die Demokraten in die Defensive.\n\nDie f\u00fcr die t\u00f6dliche Evakuierung Afghanistans verantwortlichen beiden rangh\u00f6chsten Gener\u00e4le wurden am Dienstag erneut auf den Pr\u00fcfstand gestellt. Die Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus verst\u00e4rkten ihre Kampagne, Pr\u00e4sident Biden f\u00fcr das Fiasko verantwortlich zu machen. Die Demokraten ihrerseits beschuldigten Donald Trump, die Bedingungen f\u00fcr den Zusammenbruch der Regierung in Kabul geschaffen zu haben.\n\nChaotischer Afghanistan-Abzug der USA wieder aufgerollt\n\nDie pensionierten Gener\u00e4le Mark A. Milley und Kenneth \u201eFrank\u201c McKenzie, Berufsmilit\u00e4rs, haben unter beiden Pr\u00e4sidenten in leitenden Funktionen gedient. Sie sagten vor dem Ausschuss f\u00fcr ausw\u00e4rtige Angelegenheiten des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses im Rahmen seiner Untersuchung des katastrophalen Ausstiegs der Vereinigten Staaten aus einem 20-j\u00e4hrigen Krieg im August 2021 aus.\n\nGeneral Mark A. Milley, der damalige Vorsitzende der Generalstabschefs, sagt 2022 im Capitol Hill aus. \u00a9 Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post\n\nMcKenzie sagte, dass das Pentagon zwar einen Plan f\u00fcr den Abzug aller US-Truppen, Diplomaten, B\u00fcrger und gef\u00e4hrdeten afghanischen Partner Monate, bevor die Taliban an die Macht zur\u00fcckgekehrt sind, ausgearbeitet hatte. Biden aber stattdessen beschloss, die US-Botschaft offen zu lassen und bis auf ein paar Hundert Soldaten alle abzuziehen - und damit Zehntausende in Gefahr zu lassen.\n\nThe Washington Post vier Wochen gratis lesen Ihr Qualit\u00e4ts-Ticket der washingtonpost.com: Holen Sie sich exklusive Recherchen und 200+ Geschichten vier Wochen gratis.\n\nEvakuierung durch Bidens Au\u00dfenministerium \u201ezu langsam, zu sp\u00e4t\u201c\n\n\u201eIch denke, der grundlegende Fehler \u2013 der grundlegende Makel \u2013 war der Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs des Au\u00dfenministeriums zur Evakuierung\u201c, sagte Milley. \u201eIch denke, das war zu langsam und zu sp\u00e4t, und das hat dann zu der Reihe von Ereignissen gef\u00fchrt, die sich in den letzten paar Tagen ergeben haben.\u201c\n\nDas wiederkehrende politische Rampenlicht auf die letzten Tage des Konflikts, die von Szenen grausamer Gewalt und Verzweiflung gepr\u00e4gt waren, hat die Demokraten gezwungen, sich mit einem dunklen Moment in Bidens Amtszeit als Pr\u00e4sident auseinanderzusetzen - w\u00e4hrend dieser gegen seinen Vorg\u00e4nger f\u00fcr eine zweite Amtszeit als Oberbefehlshaber k\u00e4mpft.\n\nViele demokratische Abgeordnete haben sich ihren republikanischen Kollegen angeschlossen und den Umgang der Regierung mit dem R\u00fcckzug kritisiert. Doch angesichts der bevorstehenden Neuauflage des Duells zwischen Trump und Biden stehen sie unter Druck, seine Position zu verteidigen.\n\nGerangel um Verantwortung f\u00fcr den R\u00fcckzug des US-Milit\u00e4r in Afghanistan\n\nW\u00e4hrend der gesamten Anh\u00f6rung versuchten beide Seiten abwechselnd, ihren Respekt f\u00fcr die Gener\u00e4le zu demonstrieren. Gleichzeitig wollten sie sie dazu dr\u00e4ngen, den Pr\u00e4sidenten der anderen Partei als die Person anzuerkennen, die letztlich f\u00fcr das Evakuierungsfiasko verantwortlich ist.\n\nDer Ausschussvorsitzende Michael McCaul (Republikaner) sagte, das Wei\u00dfe Haus habe sich geweigert, auf Warnungen zu h\u00f6ren, was in Afghanistan passiere, als die Taliban auf ihrem Marsch nach Kabul St\u00e4dte und Bezirke zur\u00fcckeroberten. Das Au\u00dfenministerium habe erst am 14. August 2021 zu einer vollst\u00e4ndigen Evakuierung aufgerufen \u2013 einen Tag, bevor die afghanische Regierung aus dem Land floh und Tausende von Zivilisten den Flughafen der Stadt in dem verzweifelten Versuch \u00fcberrannten, sich selbst zu evakuieren.\n\nDer Abgeordnete Michael McCaul (R-TX) spricht bei einer Anh\u00f6rung des Ausschusses f\u00fcr ausw\u00e4rtige Angelegenheiten des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses im Kapitol der Vereinigten Staaten am 19.03.2024. \u00a9 Michael Brochstein/Imago\n\n\u201eWie das Sprichwort sagt: \u201aWer daran scheitert, zu planen, plant zu scheitern\u2018\u201c, sagte McCaul \u00fcber die Regierung Biden. \u201eUnd gescheitert sind sie.\u201c Er erstellte einen Zwischenbericht zum zweiten Jahrestag der Evakuierung im vergangenen August und wird voraussichtlich im Sommer eine endg\u00fcltige Version ver\u00f6ffentlichen.\n\nBidens Beh\u00f6rden waren nicht ausreichend vorbereitet\n\nEine Untersuchung des Au\u00dfenministeriums, die im Juni letzten Jahres ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, ergab, dass die Beh\u00f6rde \u201eauf h\u00f6chster Ebene nur unzureichend \u00fcber Worst-Case-Szenarien nachgedacht hat\u201c. Auch h\u00e4tte sie nicht ber\u00fccksichtigt, wie schnell diese eintreten k\u00f6nnten, nachdem Biden beschlossen hatte, Trumps Entscheidung zum R\u00fcckzug zu befolgen. Die Beh\u00f6rde hatte auch niemanden, der eindeutig f\u00fcr die Vorbereitung einer vollst\u00e4ndigen Evakuierung zust\u00e4ndig war, so das Ergebnis der Untersuchung.\n\nEin Beamter des Au\u00dfenministeriums sagte bez\u00fcglich der Anh\u00f6rung am Dienstag, die Beh\u00f6rde sei \u201esehr stolz auf die Arbeit, die unter unglaublich schwierigen Umst\u00e4nden geleistet wurde, um die Umsiedlung von US-B\u00fcrgern, Personen mit st\u00e4ndigem Wohnsitz in den USA und Afghanen w\u00e4hrend des Abzugs und in der darauf folgenden Zeit sicherzustellen\u201c.\n\nBeide Gener\u00e4le im Ruhestand sagten, ihre Ausf\u00fchrungen st\u00fcnden im Einklang mit stundenlangen Aussagen, die sie w\u00e4hrend ihrer aktiven Dienstzeit gemacht h\u00e4tten \u2013 ein Punkt, den Repr\u00e4sentant Gregory W. Meeks (N.Y.), der f\u00fchrende Demokrat im Ausschuss, zu betonen versuchte. \u201eHier gibt es nichts Bahnbrechendes!\u201c, sagte Meeks und forderte die Gesetzgeber auf, stattdessen die Gesamtheit des Krieges zu betrachten und nicht nur sein Ende. Die \u00fcberparteiliche Afghanistan-Kriegskommission, die letztes Jahr einberufen wurde, um den gesamten 20-j\u00e4hrigen Krieg zu untersuchen, wird voraussichtlich innerhalb von vier Jahren Ergebnisse vorlegen.\n\nExplosion in Kabul t\u00f6tete w\u00e4hrend des Truppenabzugs 183 Menschen\n\nBei der Anh\u00f6rung waren auch die Familien mehrerer US-Soldaten anwesend, die bei einem Bombenanschlag am Rande des Flughafens von Kabul get\u00f6tet wurden, als die 17-t\u00e4gige Evakuierung sich dem Ende neigte. Die Explosion folgte auf tagelange \u00f6ffentliche Warnungen der Regierung Biden, dass der Islamische Staat, der einen Ableger in Afghanistan unterh\u00e4lt, kurz vor einem Angriff stehe. Bei dem Selbstmordanschlag starben sch\u00e4tzungsweise 170 Afghanen und 13 amerikanische Soldaten. Dutzende weitere wurden verwundet.\n\nDie Republikaner Cory Mills und Michael Lawler kritisierten McKenzie und Milley daf\u00fcr, dass sie nicht die Aussage eines Scharfsch\u00fctzen der Marines, Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews, beachtet haben. Dieser sagte, dass er kurz vor dem Angriff einen Mann in der Menge sah, auf den die Beschreibung des Selbstmordattent\u00e4ters zutraf, ihm aber die Erlaubnis verweigert wurde, ihn zu erschie\u00dfen. Vargas-Andrews, der bei der Explosion schwer verwundet wurde und bei der Anh\u00f6rung am Dienstag anwesend war, hat den Gesetzgebern im vergangenen Jahr einen emotionalen Bericht \u00fcber den Bombenanschlag und seine Folgen vorgelegt, der das Pentagon veranlasste, die Ergebnisse seiner Untersuchung des Vorfalls zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Es wird erwartet, dass die Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchung bald ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden.\n\nBiden: \u00dcbernahme Afghanistans durch die Taliban sei \u201eh\u00f6chst unwahrscheinlich\u201c gewesen\n\nMcKenzie und die Verantwortlichen des Pentagon erkl\u00e4rten der \u00d6ffentlichkeit im Jahr 2022, dass der Bombenanschlag auf den Flughafen \u201enicht zu verhindern\u201c gewesen sei. Der Abgeordnete Michael Waltz (Republikaner), ein pensionierter Offizier der Special Forces, sagte, er sei w\u00fctend, wenn er sich daran erinnere, wie Biden in den Wochen vor der Krise die Aussicht heruntergespielt habe, dass Afghanistan an die Taliban fallen k\u00f6nnte. In einem Fall, so Waltz, habe Biden im Juli 2021 gesagt, es sei \u201eh\u00f6chst unwahrscheinlich\u201c, dass die Taliban das Land \u00fcberrennen w\u00fcrden \u2013 obwohl die Gener\u00e4le privat davor gewarnt h\u00e4tten, dass ein solches Ergebnis schnell eintreten k\u00f6nne.\n\n\u201eMeine Einsch\u00e4tzung war damals: Wenn wir die US-Streitkr\u00e4fte auf null reduzieren w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrden die afghanischen Regierung und die [afghanischen Streitkr\u00e4fte] sehr wahrscheinlich zusammenbrechen und die Taliban w\u00fcrden die Macht \u00fcbernehmen\u201c, sagte Milley am Dienstag. \u201eAber ich pers\u00f6nlich dachte, es w\u00fcrde im Herbst sein, irgendwo um Thanksgiving herum. Die Einsch\u00e4tzungen gingen weit auseinander.\u201c\n\nDas Wei\u00dfe Haus, das zu Milleys Aussage befragt wurde, zitierte ein Dokument, das das Wei\u00dfe Haus im vergangenen Fr\u00fchjahr ver\u00f6ffentlicht hatte. In dem hei\u00dft es, dass Biden bei seinem Amtsantritt einen \u201ebewussten, intensiven, strengen und umfassenden Entscheidungsprozess\u201c \u00fcber den Umgang mit dem Krieg eingeleitet habe. \u201eLetztendlich weigerte sich Pr\u00e4sident Biden, eine weitere Generation von Amerikanern in einen Krieg zu schicken, der f\u00fcr die Vereinigten Staaten schon l\u00e4ngst h\u00e4tte beendet sein sollen\u201c, hei\u00dft es darin.\n\nUS-Visa f\u00fcr evakuierte Afghanen werden knapp\n\nMehrere Demokraten auf dem Podium versuchten, die ihrer Meinung nach widerspr\u00fcchliche Haltung der Republikaner in der Afghanistan-Politik hervorzuheben. Sie wiesen darauf hin, dass die Emp\u00f6rung der Republikaner \u00fcber die Aufgabe von US-Verb\u00fcndeten sich in sinnvolle Hilfen f\u00fcr die zur\u00fcckgelassenen Afghanen und diejenigen, die in die Vereinigten Staaten umgesiedelt wurden, niederschlagen sollte. Die Verb\u00fcndeten waren w\u00e4hrend einer milit\u00e4rischen Luftbr\u00fccke, die 124.000 Menschen in Sicherheit brachte, gestrandet.\n\nF\u00fcrsprecher f\u00fcr Afghanen, zu denen auch f\u00fchrende Veteranengruppen des US-Milit\u00e4rs geh\u00f6ren, haben davor gewarnt, dass Tausende von Afghanen, die der US-Mission gedient haben, in Afghanistan verbleiben. Zudem k\u00f6nne das Au\u00dfenministerium bald keine speziellen Einwanderungsvisa mehr f\u00fcr sie ausstellen, wenn der Kongress nicht handelt.\n\nEs gibt etwa 20.000 Afghanen - ihre Familienangeh\u00f6rigen nicht mitgerechnet - die eine vorl\u00e4ufige Genehmigung erhalten haben und \u201ebald ein Visum ben\u00f6tigen\u201c. Dies schrieb eine \u00fcberparteiliche Gruppe von Senatoren unter der Leitung von Senatorin Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) letzte Woche in einem Brief an die Senatsf\u00fchrer. Am 1. M\u00e4rz \u201ewaren noch etwa 7.000 Visa \u00fcbrig\u201c, so die Gruppe.\n\nUngef\u00e4hrliche R\u00fcckkehr nach Afghanistan werde \u201eJahre dauern\u201c\n\nDemokrat Jason Crow, ein Armee-Veteran, der in Afghanistan gedient hat, forderte seine Kollegen auf, den Afghan Allies Protection Act zu unterzeichnen \u2013 eine partei\u00fcbergreifende Gesetzesvorlage, die immer wieder von den Republikanern vereitelt wird. Der Kongress k\u00f6nne immer noch \u201eLeben retten, indem er dieses Gesetz verabschiedet und unseren Freunden den Weg nach drau\u00dfen ebnet\u201c, so Crow.\n\nZu den Autoren Dan Lamothe arbeitet seit 2014 f\u00fcr die Washington Post und berichtet \u00fcber das US-Milit\u00e4r. Er schreibt seit mehr als 15 Jahren \u00fcber die Streitkr\u00e4fte, ist viel gereist, hat f\u00fcnf Teilstreitkr\u00e4fte kennengelernt und \u00fcber Kampfeins\u00e4tze in Afghanistan berichtet. Abigail Hauslohner ist Reporterin f\u00fcr nationale Sicherheit bei der Washington Post mit Schwerpunkt auf dem Kongress. In ihrem Jahrzehnt bei der Zeitung war sie als Korrespondentin unterwegs und schrieb \u00fcber Themen von Einwanderung bis hin zu politischem Extremismus und berichtete als B\u00fcroleiterin der Post in Kairo \u00fcber den Nahen Osten. Leigh Ann Caldwell ist Mitautorin von The Washington Post\u2018s Early 202 und besch\u00e4ftigt sich mit dem Kongress und der Politik. Au\u00dferdem ist sie Moderatorin bei Washington Post Live und f\u00fchrt Interviews mit hohem Nachrichtenwert. Bevor sie 2022 zu The Post kam, war Caldwell Korrespondentin bei NBC News, zuletzt als Mitglied der Kongressabteilung.\n\nDer Abgeordnete Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) fragte, wie lange es dauern wird, bis die Amerikaner Afghanistan auf \u00e4hnliche Weise besuchen k\u00f6nnen, wie er Vietnam besucht hat, um zu sehen, wo sein Vater get\u00f6tet wurde. \u201eEs wird Jahre dauern\u201c, antwortete Milley. \u201eIch glaube, dass die Taliban immer noch eine terroristische Organisation sind. Ich glaube immer noch, dass sie unglaubliche, grausame Vergeltungsma\u00dfnahmen in ihrem eigenen Land durchf\u00fchren, und ich w\u00fcrde keinem Familienmitglied zu diesem Zeitpunkt empfehlen, zur\u00fcckzukehren.\u201c\n\nMilley f\u00fcgte hinzu, dass es ihm schwer fallen werde, sich jemals mit den Taliban zu vers\u00f6hnen. \u201eIch werde wahrscheinlich damit ins Grab gehen\u201c, sagte er.\n\nWir testen zurzeit maschinelle \u00dcbersetzungen.

Smith is prosecuting Trump in two separate federal cases, one involving Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and one involving his alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Both cases are still ongoing.\n\nTrump still faces charges in classified documents, election interference cases\n\nThe federal judges responsible have not brought an end to the two criminal cases brought against Trump as a result of Smith's investigations.\n\nTrump faces 40 counts in the classified documents case, including charges of obstructing justice, making false statements and trying to \"alter, destroy, mutilate or conceal evidence.\" More than 300 classified documents were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, over a year after he left the White House\n\nJudge Eileen Cannon is expected to postpone a May 20 trial date because of disputes in the case, and she has said it will probably be later than the prosecution's proposal of July 8.

He is accused of falsely claiming election fraud and trying to overturn the legitimate 2020 election results.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan canceled a March 4 trial date as higher courts weigh Trump's claim that a former president is immune from prosecution for official acts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal and scheduled arguments for the week of April 22.\n\nIn the first comment, the social media user who made the post shared a link to an article published in January about Chutkan barring Smith from filing pretrial motions without permission as Trump's immunity claim is decided.

Right: President Joe Biden speaks in Milwaukee, Wis., August 15, 2023.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee chairman James Comer (R., Ky.) will soon be inviting President Joe Biden to testify about his family\u2019s business dealings for the House GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nTwo of Hunter Biden\u2019s former business partners, Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, testified on Wednesday to discuss the president\u2019s alleged role in his son\u2019s foreign business enterprise. At the end of the hearing Comer announced his plans to invite President Biden to testify himself.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days, I will invite President Biden to the House Oversight Committee to provide his testimony and explain why his family received tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies with his assistance,\u201d Comer announced. He did not specify whether he would issue a subpoena to the White House to compel testimony from Joe Biden.\n\nWhite House spokesman Ian Sams mocked Comer\u2019s announcement as a \u201cstunt\u201d and dismissed the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHunter Biden did not attend the hearing on Wednesday after previously having demanded that House Republicans allow him to testify publicly. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, told Comer last week that his client would not appear for the public hearing because it was designed to be a media circus. Devon Archer, a former Biden business partner and key witness in the impeachment inquiry, also declined to show up for the public hearing.\n\nIn closed-door testimony last month, Hunter Biden confirmed that his father met foreign business partners and spoke to business associates on speakerphone, corroborating significant portions of Archer\u2019s and Bobulinski\u2019s testimony. Nonetheless, he repeatedly insisted that Joe Biden played no role in his business dealings.\n\nJoe Biden himself has repeatedly denied having had any involvement with Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas dealings. The White House has disparaged and dismissed the impeachment inquiry on numerous occasions.\n\nThe extent of Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in his son\u2019s business enterprise during and after his vice presidency is the focus of the House GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Evidence gathered by the impeachment inquiry includes bank records, witness testimony, texts, emails, images, and other documents relevant to the investigation. Republican investigators have scrutinized Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with individuals and entities in Ukraine, China, Russia, Romania, and Kazakhstan.\n\nAt the hearing, Bobulinski suggested that Joe Biden committed various crimes by assisting his son with his business dealings and voiced his support for impeaching the president. Most Notably, Bobulinski accused Hunter Biden and his uncle Jim of lying under oath about their business dealings with Chinese conglomerate CEFC.\n\nSimilarly, Galanis claimed that Hunter Biden had used his father to help close lucrative business deals and mentioned how Hunter leveraged the \u201cBiden lift,\u201d a term used by Galanis to describe access to Joe Biden.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss is prosecuting Hunter Biden for alleged federal gun and tax crimes committed in Delaware and California. Lowell claimed that Hunter Biden\u2019s court date in California on Thursday conflicted with the timing of the hearing.\n\nMore on National Review\n\nNews Related",

Trump, who is hoping to make immigration a key plank of his presidential campaign, has suggested on Truth Social that approving additional resources for the border would make Republicans \u201clook bad.\u201d\n\nOffering a blunt assessment of the grim prospects facing the bill, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that the deal \u201cwill not become law,\u201d due to Johnson\u2019s opposition and concerns within the Senate GOP conference.\n\n\u201cWe had a very robust discussion about whether or not this product could ever become law, and it\u2019s been made pretty clear to us by the speaker that it will not become law,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo high-ranking members of Senate GOP leadership \u2013 John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, and John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican \u2013 announced that they will vote against the measure in an initial procedural vote on Wednesday, the latest blow to a deal that was negotiated by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the most conservative senators, along with Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n\nA majority of Senate Republicans are now either actively planning to vote \u201cno\u201d during the first procedural vote on the package Wednesday or leaning against the bill. Many Republicans have attacked the policy directly, and some have argued there should be more time to consider, debate and amend the bill after it was released on Sunday evening.\n\nThune, the Senate GOP whip, said that he plans to vote against proceeding to the bill on Wednesday and said that blocking the package will be the \u201cpredominate position\u201d of GOP senators. Later in the day, Thune said, \u201cI would expect that the motion to proceed to the bill will fail.\u201d\n\nBarrasso, the chairman of the Senate GOP Conference, said in a statement, \u201cI cannot vote for this bill. Americans will turn to the upcoming election to end the border crisis.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer harshly criticized Senate Republicans on Tuesday for deciding to oppose the package as it is currently written, accusing them of acting on Trump\u2019s marching orders.\n\n\u201cWe all know what\u2019s going on here. Donald Trump would rather keep the chaos at the border so he can exploit it on the campaign trail, instead of letting the Senate do the right thing and fix it. He would rather let Ukraine suffer on the battlefield, instead of being tough on Putin,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd instead of standing up to Donald Trump, Senate Republicans are ready to kill our best chance at fixing the border and ready to vote down this aid package for Ukraine in order to put what they think \u2013 they think \u2013 is their party\u2019s political interest above the interests of the country.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leader also went after Republican demands for more time to read the bill, noting that they had requested 72 hours, and saying he would offer to move the first procedural vote to Thursday if they want another day. \u201cI suspect they won\u2019t accept even that offer, because they really don\u2019t want more time. They\u2019re just using it as an excuse,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, another prominent senior Republican, said he plans to vote no on moving forward with the deal, adding that he wants to see changes to parts of the bill.\n\n\u201cWe need more time,\u201d Cornyn told CNN, adding later: \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 on the motion to proceed.\u201d\n\nMurphy, a key Democratic border deal negotiator, blasted Senate Republicans on Tuesday, calling them a \u201cdisaster\u201d and describing their treatment of Lankford, the top GOP negotiator, as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d saying he never expected they would leave him \u201changing out to dry as badly as they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never expected they would leave Senator Lankford hanging out to dry as badly as they did,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI thought they would be able to find the votes to support a very tough, conservative compromise that he was able to win.\u201d\n\nLankford said on Tuesday that he has been \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his colleagues who he says are mischaracterizing the package in order to reject it, rather than what is actually in the bill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s disappointing to me, is to say if you\u2019re going to disagree with it, disagree with it based on the facts of the bill, not something that\u2019s actually factually not true,\u201d he said, pointing to accusations that the package includes amnesty, allows thousands more migrants to enter the US, and incentivizes more people to cross the border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the misinformation that\u2019s out there, and how effective that has been,\u201d added Lankford.\n\nHe acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s not looking good\u201d for the package to eventually become law, as more GOP senators demand more time to consider the language or reject it outright.\n\nOn Tuesday, McConnell said, \u201cI want to congratulate Senator Lankford on a remarkable job of negotiating with the other side, getting the support of the border council, but it looks to me and to most of our members is that we have no real chance here to make a law.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and other Republicans have attacked the bill as too weak, it would mark a tough change to immigration law and would give the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board called the deal \u201cthe most restrictive migrant legislation in decades,\u201d saying \u201cits provisions include long-time GOP priorities\u201d in an op-ed titled \u201cA Border Security Bill Worth Passing.\u201d\n\nThe sweeping legislative package would also provide aid to key US allies abroad, including billions of dollars to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine.\n\nIt is unclear if Congress will be able to pass aid to Ukraine and Israel separate from border measures as many Republican senators had previously demanded that the issues be paired together.\n\nAsked if Congress should drop the border elements of the package and pass the rest of the security supplemental for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Cornyn indicated he supported that approach.\n\n\u201cI would say defer the border and do the rest,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is pushing to pass a stand-alone Israel aid package on Tuesday, but that is also on the brink of collapse amid opposition from far-right Republicans and Democratic leaders, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nPresident Joe Biden would veto a House standalone aid package for Israel, the White House said Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Administration spent months working with a bipartisan group of Senators to reach a national security agreement that secures the border and provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel, while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by conflicts around the world,\u201d the White House wrote in a statement. \u201cInstead of working in good faith to address the most pressing national security challenges, this bill is another cynical political maneuver.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "text": "The economic toll of inflation rates in the U.S. remains a top issue for voters in the 2024 presidential cycle.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, nearly three-quarters of Americans say strengthening the economy is their top priority, driven by worries about inflation. 72% of adults are very concerned about the price of food and consumer goods and 63% are very worried about the cost of housing.\n\nDespite inflation having fallen by about 6 percent since its high in 2022 and the U.S. enjoying the lowest inflation among countries in the G7, an informal group of advanced economies including Germany, Japan and the U.K.\n\nThe tide might be starting to turn as views on the economy shift: a Suffolk University and USA TODAY poll shows that 33 percent of respondents describe the economy as being in \u201ceconomic recovery,\u201d up from 9 percent less than two years ago.\n\nWith voters so concerned about inflation and the economy, they will likely consider President Joe Biden\u2019s and former President Donald Trump\u2019s inflation-reducing plans when making their decision.\n\nHow does Biden plan to fix inflation?\n\nBiden has touted his Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in August of 2022, but it hasn\u2019t yet curbed prices\u2014which even he admits.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t called it that because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it has to do with providing alternatives that generate economic growth,\u201d the president said in August 2023.\n\nHowever, the law also hasn\u2019t caused prices to increase, and it has the potential to bring down inflation in the future. By 2030, the White House says it will cut electricity rates by as much as 9 percent through tax credits for renewable energy, and lower gas prices by as much as 13 percent through electric vehicle tax credits.\n\nThe law could also bring down inflation through its health care provisions, which include capping monthly insulin prices and out-of-pocket prescription drugs.\n\nBiden has pledged to do more on inflation. In a statement on March 12, he said that his recent budget proposal would lower prescription drug costs, health care, child care, and education costs, rents by building two million homes, and taxes on the wealthy and corporations. However, the proposal is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled House.\n\nMore:Taxing the rich to cut deficit: Five takeaways from President Biden's proposed budget\n\nWhere does Trump stand on fixing inflation?\n\nTrump voters have mentioned inflation and the economy as reasons for voting for the former president. However, according to economists, his agenda includes few inflation-reducing policies.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s plans to curb inflation would be more gas production. He said that America should \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d But America is already drilling: U.S. oil output hit record highs last year.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s plans is to increase tariffs on goods from China by as much as 60 percent or more. But these tariffs wouldn\u2019t just hurt foreign producers; costs could be passed onto the goods themselves, raising prices for consumers.\n\nThe campaign also promises a large-scale deportation of undocumented immigrants. If that plan were implemented, labor shortages would raise prices because of either fewer goods or raised wages.\n\nTrump has also mentioned his intent to deregulate businesses, which could reduce inflation as businesses save costs. But he has not offered any more details on those plans.\n\nOther factors that lower inflation\n\nThe president often gets celebrated when the economy is doing well, and blamed when it\u2019s doing poorly. But the reality is that the administration usually has little control over how the economy performs.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s not just the White House that controls inflation; in reality, the Federal Reserve is the agency mainly responsible, and makes decisions independent of the president. To keep inflation low, the Fed\u2019s principal tool is raising interest rates. However, higher interest rates can make home ownership more expensive.\n\nOil and gas prices have a significant impact on inflation. Recently, their rise and fall have been tied to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In general, oil prices are driven by global events rather than U.S. domestic policy.\n\nThe pandemic is also to blame. Supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic increased shipping costs, which in turn increased the prices of goods. As those kinks have been worked out recently, prices have fallen.\n\nInflation is receding: while not yet at the 2% recommended by the Federal Reserve, it\u2019s at 3.1 percent right now\u2014much lower than 9.1 percent in 2022.\n\nYet, high prices remain fresh in voters\u2019 minds, and both Biden and Trump will likely want to prove themselves the best candidates for the job.",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more -- $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don't show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won't be made until April.\n\nBiden's campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \"historic\" total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n- 'Dumpster fire' -\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers' bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump's Save America political action committee -- money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump's woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \"witch hunt,\" seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters -- and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\"I'm calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\" a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \"KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\" his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E.

            "text": " No place in the US is safe from the climate crisis, but a new report shows where it\u2019s most severe\nCNN  \u2014  none\nThe effects of a rapidly warming climate are being felt in every corner of the US and will worsen over the next 10 years with continued fossil fuel use\ufeff, according to a stark new report from federal agencies.\n\nThe Fifth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report due roughly every five years, warned that even though planet-warming pollution in the US is slowly decreasing, it is not happening nearly fast enough to meet the nation\u2019s targets, nor is it in line with the UN-sanctioned goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2013 a threshold beyond which scientists warn life on Earth will struggle to cope.\n\nThis year\u2019s assessment reflects the reality that Americans can increasingly see and feel climate impacts in their own communities, said Katharine Hayhoe, a distinguished climate scientist at Texas Tech University and contributor to the report.\n\n\u201cClimate change is affecting every aspect of our lives,\u201d Hayhoe told CNN.\n\nSome of the report\u2019s sweeping conclusions remain painfully familiar: No part of the US is truly safe from climate disasters; slashing fossil fuel use is critical to limit the consequences, but we\u2019re not doing it fast enough; and every fraction of a degree of warming leads to more intense impacts.\n\nBut there are some important new additions: Scientists can now say with more confidence when the climate crisis has made rainstorms, hurricanes and wildfires stronger or more frequent, long-term drought more severe and heat more deadly.\n\nThe remains of a vehicle in a burned neighborhood after wildfires in Lahaina in Maui, Hawaii, on August 18.\nThis summer alone, the Phoenix area baked through a record 31 consecutive days above 110 degrees, a shocking heatwave that was partly responsible for more than 500 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County in 2023 \u2013 its deadliest year for heat on record.\n\nIn July, a torrential rainstorm deluged parts of Vermont in deadly floodwaters. Then in August, Maui was devastated by a fast-moving wildfire and Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast was slammed by its second major hurricane in two years.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Tuesday and is expected to unveil more than $6 billion in funding to strengthen climate resilience \u201cby bolstering America\u2019s electric grid, investing in water infrastructure upgrades, reducing flood risk to communities, and advancing environmental justice for all,\u201d an administration official said.\n\nThe US needs \u201ca transformation of the global economy on a size and scale that\u2019s never occurred in human history\u201d to \u201ccreate a livable future for ourselves and our children,\u201d White House senior climate adviser John Podesta told reporters.\n\nHere are five significant takeaways from the federal government\u2019s sweeping climate report.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to pinpoint which disasters were made worse by climate change\n\nThe latest report contains an important advancement in what\u2019s called \u201cattribution science\u201d \u2013 scientists can more definitively show how climate change is affecting extreme events, like heatwaves, droughts to hurricanes and severe rainstorms.\n\nClimate change doesn\u2019t cause things like hurricanes or wildfires, but it can make them more intense or more frequent.\n\nFor instance, warmer oceans and air temperatures mean hurricanes are getting stronger faster and dumping more rainfall when they slam ashore. And hotter and drier conditions from climate change can help vegetation and trees become tinderboxes, turning wildfires into megafires that spin out of control.\n\n\u201cNow thanks to the field of attribution, we can make specific statements,\u201d Hayhoe said, saying attribution can help pinpoint certain areas of a city that are now more likely to flood due to the effects of climate change. \u201cThe field of attribution has advanced significantly over the last five years, and that really helps people connect the dots.\u201d\n\nWhat's the weather forecast for 2050?\n\n04:18 - Source: CNN\nAll regions are feeling climate change, but some more severely\n\nThere is no place immune from climate change, Biden administration officials and the report\u2019s scientists emphasized, and this summer\u2019s extreme weather was a deadly reminder.\n\nSome states \u2013 including California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas \u2013 are facing more significant storms and extreme swings in precipitation.\n\nLandlocked states won\u2019t have to adapt to sea level rise, though some \u2013 including Appalachian states like Kentucky and West Virginia \u2013 have seen devastating flooding from rainstorms.\n\nAnd states in the north are grappling with an increase in tick-borne diseases, less snow, and stronger rainstorms.\n\n\u201cThere is no place that is not at risk, but there are some that are more or less at risk,\u201d Hayhoe told CNN. \u201cThat is a factor of both the increasingly frequent and severe weather and climate extremes you\u2019re exposed to, as well as how prepared (cities and states) are.\u201d\n\nClimate change is exacting a massive economic toll\n\nClimate shocks on the economy are happening more frequently, the report said, evidenced by the new record this year for the number of extreme weather disasters costing at least $1 billion. And disaster experts have spent the last year warning the US is only beginning to see the economic fallout of the climate crisis.\n\nClimate risks are hitting the housing market in the form of skyrocketing homeowners\u2019 insurance rates. Some insurers have pulled out of high-risk states altogether.\n\nStronger storms wiping out certain crops or extreme heat killing livestock can send food prices soaring. And in the Southwest, the report\u2019s researchers found that hotter temperatures in the future could lead to a 25% loss of physical work capacity for agricultural workers from July to September.\n\nThe US is cutting planet-warming pollution, but not nearly fast enough\n\nUnlike the world\u2019s other top polluters \u2013 China and India \u2013 planet-warming pollution in the US is declining. But it\u2019s not happening nearly fast enough to stabilize the planet\u2019s warming or meet the United States\u2019 international climate commitments, the report explains.\n\nThe country\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 12% between 2005 and 2019, driven in large part by the electricity sector moving away from coal and toward renewable energy and methane gas, the latter of which is still a fossil fuel that has a significant global warming effect.\n\nThe decline is good news for the climate crisis, but look at the fine print and the picture is mixed.\n\nThe report finds US planet-warming emissions \u201cremain substantial\u201d and would have to sharply decline by 6% annually on average to be in line with the international 1.5-degree goal. To put that cut into perspective, US emissions decreased by less than 1% per year between 2005 and 2019 \u2013 a tiny annual drop.\n\nLeading scientist explains how cities can help solve climate change\n\n03:13 - Source: CNN\nWater \u2013 too much and not enough \u2013 is a huge problem for the US\n\nOne of the report\u2019s biggest takeaways centers on the precarious future of water in the US, and how parts of the country are facing a future with either extreme drought and water insecurity, or more flooding and sea level rise.\n\nDrought and less snowpack are huge threats to Southwest communities in particular. The report\u2019s Southwest chapter, led by Arizona State University climate scientist Dave White, found the region was significantly drier from 1991 to 2020 than the three decades before.\n\nWhite said that\u2019s an ominous sign as the planet continues to warm, with significant threats to snowpack in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains and the Rockies \u2013 both of which provide crucial freshwater in the West.\n\nWhite added that a lack of freshwater in the region also has significant economic and agricultural impacts, as it supports cities, farms, and Native American tribes.\n\n\u201cMountains are our natural reservoirs in the region,\u201d White told CNN. \u201cClimate impacts on that mountain snowpack have really significant negative effects for the way our infrastructure operates. It\u2019s just critical for us to protect those resources.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Donald Judd contributed to this report.\n        ",

            "text": "Biden Administration\u2019s Electric Vehicle Regulations Spark Debate and Uncertainty\n\nIn a move that could have significant implications for American consumers, the Biden administration has unveiled new regulations aimed at promoting clean vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency claims these regulations will enhance consumer choice in clean vehicles, but critics argue that they will actually limit options and push Americans towards costly and less reliable electric vehicles. The EPA\u2019s ambitious goal of having plug-in electric vehicles make up the majority of the automotive market overlooks the fact that consumers have been slow to adopt EVs due to concerns about range, refueling times, and high costs. Despite substantial subsidies, electric vehicles accounted for only 7.6% of vehicle sales in 2023, with the average cost of owning an EV over five years exceeding $92,000 compared to $76,500 for a gas-powered vehicle.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of widespread charging infrastructure poses a significant challenge for EV users, with many chargers being slow and unreliable. Issues with charging availability and functionality have further dampened consumer enthusiasm for electric vehicles, leading some automakers to scale back their EV production plans in response to shifting market demands. The economic impact of these regulations extends beyond individual consumers, as taxpayers are also on the hook for subsidizing new production facilities for electric vehicles. In Michigan, for example, lawmakers have pledged $200 million in taxpayer money for just one Ford battery plant.\n\nAs the debate over the Biden administration\u2019s push towards electric vehicles continues, it is clear that the transition away from gas-powered cars will not be without its challenges and costs. Critics warn that the administration\u2019s focus on EVs could ultimately limit consumer choice, drive up prices, and burden taxpayers with the cost of subsidizing the shift to electric vehicles. The road ahead for the automotive industry and American consumers is likely to be paved with uncertainty as the push towards clean vehicles gathers momentum.\n\n#CleanVehicles #EVTransition #ChargingInfrastructure #ConsumerChoice #EVDebate #EnvironmentalRegulations\n\nLinks to article:",

            "text": "In February, President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign demonstrated a significant increase in fundraising, collecting $21 million, which elevated its cash on hand to $71 million. This financial boost contributed to a combined total of $97.5 million available for Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), a figure that notably surpasses the $44.8 million held by former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC). These figures exclude funds from both parties\u2019 joint fundraising efforts.\n\nDespite trailing behind Trump in early polling for the general election, Biden\u2019s growing financial resources provide an edge. In contrast, Trump\u2019s fundraising this cycle has not matched his 2020 campaign efforts, partly due to funds being allocated to his legal expenses through a leadership PAC. Biden\u2019s campaign has been considerably more frugal in legal spending, reporting only $122,000 in such expenses.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign is leveraging its financial advantage to initiate a substantial advertising push, marked by a recent $30 million investment in TV and digital ads, aimed at countering Trump. Although Biden\u2019s fundraising totals still fall short of those seen in the 2020 campaign for the same period, the campaign\u2019s strategic ad spending and mockery of Trump\u2019s financial challenges underscore its aggressive approach.\n\nIn addition to ad expenditures, Biden\u2019s campaign is ramping up its operations. Following the State of the Union address, a new ad campaign targeting swing states was launched, with $1.9 million spent on advertising in just one week. The campaign also celebrated a $10 million fundraising milestone within 24 hours post-State of the Union.\n\nOperational expenses are on the rise, with February\u2019s payroll expanding from nearly $1.2 million in January to over $1.6 million. Significant investments were made in media production, travel, and text messaging, alongside notable spending at Capriotti\u2019s Sandwich Shop, a favorite of Biden\u2019s. As the campaign moves forward, it plans to significantly increase staff, particularly in swing states, indicating a strategic build-up for the forthcoming election battle.",

            "text": "The Biden administration has announced the implementation of the most stringent vehicle emission regulations in US history. The new policy aims to drastically increase the prevalence of electric cars, setting a goal for 56% of new car sales to be electric by 2032. This initiative is forecasted to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 7 billion tonnes over the next three decades. The move has led to significant pushback from the auto industry, with companies facing hefty fines if they fail to comply with the new standards.\n\nEnvironmental advocates have largely welcomed the regulations, although there are voices within the activist community who believe the measures could have been more ambitious. The approach stands in contrast to the more aggressive strategies adopted by the UK and the EU, both of which plan to ban the sale of petrol cars by 2035, eliciting a mix of praise and critique from various sectors in the US.\n\nThe announcement comes in the context of relatively slow adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the American market, where EVs represented less than 8% of new car sales in the previous year. The regulation outlines annual limits on vehicle emissions, permitting the continued production of petrol-powered vehicles, provided they constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of a manufacturer's overall product lineup.\n\nNavigating the political challenges, the Biden administration seeks to balance the employment concerns of autoworkers, particularly in crucial states such as Michigan, against the imperative of addressing climate change. The controversial nature of the regulation suggests potential legal battles on the horizon, possibly from the oil industry and Republican-governed states, which may ultimately lead the Supreme Court to determine the regulation's fate.",

            "text": "February 15, 2024. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have a long phone conversation. The communiqu\u00e9 published by the White House briefing room says they spoke about humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and Israeli military operations.\n\nA few hours later, Netanyahu posted a message on X, saying bluntly:\n\n\u201cIsrael will continue to oppose the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. Such recognition in the wake of the October 7 massacre would give a huge reward to unprecedented terrorism and prevent any future peace settlement\u201d.\n\nIt seems clear that the Biden administration would like to see the rapid creation of a Palestinian state or at least a \u201cPalestinian unity government\u201d \u2014 unfortunately composed of the Palestinian Authority and the terrorist group Hamas \u2014 and, abracadabra, recognize it.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration and a small group of Middle East partners are rushing to complete a detailed, comprehensive plan for long-term peace between Israel and Palestinians, including a firm timeline for the establishment of a Palestinian state\u201d.\n\nThe article suggests that the US State Department is conducting a review of options for recognizing the \u201cPalestinian state\u201d as soon as the war ends.\n\nThe article also says that there is an \u201celephant in the planning room\u201d: the talks are taking place without any Israeli participation. As Netanyahu\u2019s message shows, they are taking place against the will of Israel\u2019s prime minister and his government. They are even taking place against the will of almost all members of the Israel\u2019s parliament (the Knesset): they voted 99-to-11 on February 21 to back the government\u2019s decision to reject \u201cinternational dictates regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians and the establishment of a Palestinian state\u201d and its \u201cunilateral recognition\u201d.\n\nHow can members of the Biden administration think it will achieve any kind of \u201cpeace\u201d between Israel and Palestinians under these conditions? They probably do not. They probably are just looking at the election polls in Michigan, where many Democrats who are likely pro-Hamas recently voted \u201cuncommitted\u201d in the party\u2019s presidential primary. How can officials in the administration even imagine being able to create a Palestinian state without Israel\u2019s acceptance? They are probably hoping \u2014 as with three years of US open borders, stifling US energy production and appeasing US adversaries such as Russia, China and Iran \u2014 that they can get away with it.\n\nHow can the Biden administration fail to see that creating an essentially unrevitalized Palestinian state or a terrorist \u201cPalestinian Unity Government\u201d just months after the October 7 massacre would constitute a huge reward for terrorism?\n\nThe Biden administration also appears ready to reward terrorists. It already does. On October 18, the Biden administration gave $100 million in \u201chumanitarian aid\u201d to Gaza and the West Bank, just 11 days after the October 7 massacre \u2014 knowing full well that Gaza was controlled by Hamas and that the money and aid would end up with Hamas.\n\nThe Biden administration, to its great credit, sent US Navy aircraft carriers to the area, munitions to Israel and has verbally supported it \u2014 but they are also apparently trying not to lose the \u201cArab-American vote.\u201d\n\nOn January 26, 2021, six days after Biden was sworn in, acting US Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Mills said that the Biden administration would \u201crestore aid\u201d to the Palestinian Authority (PA). A few weeks later, without the Biden administration even asking the PA to stop funding terrorism , aid was restored.\n\nIn 2021, when Hamas attacked Israel, the Biden administration pressured the Israeli government to stop the Israeli response. When a ceasefire was implemented, Biden promised to provide rapid humanitarian assistance for the Gaza population and aid for the reconstruction of Gaza. Even then, it was clear that the aid would help the ruling terrorist group Hamas, whatever denials Biden stated at that time, such as: \u201cWe will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority \u2014 not Hamas\u201d.\n\nTo \u201cmanage\u201d the situation, Biden sent Hady Amr, a man who had written that the terrorist group Hamas should be included in the negotiations; Biden then named Amr the US Special Representative for Palestinian Affairs.\n\nOn January 19, 2021, Antony Blinken, who was not yet sworn in as Secretary of State, pledged that the Biden administration would negotiate a new agreement with Israel\u2019s main enemy in the region, Iran. Nine days later, having become Secretary of State, he appointed as Special Envoy to Iran Robert Malley, a man reportedly sympathetic to Iran and later suspended for activity currently under investigation \u2013 if the investigation has not been secretly dropped.\n\nThe Biden administration then lifted various sanctions on Iran\u2019s regime and gradually unfroze billions of dollars of Iranian funds. Although the main funder of Hamas has been Qatar \u2013 which provide \u201cprotection money\u201d \u201cwithout protection\u201d \u2014 Iran has reportedly been giving Hamas $100 million a year, part of which was likely used to finance Hamas\u2019s October 7 massacre and war machine.\n\nIn a move no one ever talks about, the Palestinian Authority \u2014 in a move recommended by the 2009 Fayyed Plan and implemented with the inordinately generous help of the European Union \u2014 have been rushing as fast as they can to build \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d in disputed areas, thereby bypassing the direct negotiations to which both sides had agreed. These \u201cfacts\u201d\u201d now include at least \u201cclose to 10,000\u201d illegal Arab construction sites. All the same, under the Israeli government of then PM Naftali Bennet, the Biden administration, published statements hostile to Israel and to the Jewish \u201csettlements\u201d on the West Bank. Many Palestinians, nevertheless, appear to view all of Israel as \u201cone big settlement\u201d.\n\nAs soon as Netanyahu won the Israeli elections on November 1, 2022, the Biden administration\u2019s hostility intensified \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 against Netanyahu himself. The State Department helped to fund months-long anti-Netanyahu protests that were essentially aimed at bringing down his government \u2014 first, so Iran could get a nuclear weapon and then to agree to a ceasefire, or a \u201cPalestinian State\u201d, or a terrorist unity government or, one assumes, whatever the Biden administration requests.\n\nImmediately after the October 7 massacre, Blinken and Biden showed their support for Israel but even then began started to pressure Israel \u2014 not Hamas or Iran or Hamas\u2019s sponsor, Qatar. Blinken reportedly made the supply of munitions to the Israeli military conditional on Israel\u2019s acceptance of the payment of a hundred million dollars in aid to the Palestinians from the United States. \u201c[D]on\u2019t be consumed by rage\u201d, Biden cautioned. Since then, for the most part, pressures have continued to increase.\n\nOn November 30, Blinken denounced the \u201cmassive loss of civilian lives\u201d resulting from Israeli military action in Gaza and added that Israel must \u201crespect international humanitarian law\u201d, implying that Israel was not. Israel, meanwhile, has been going to extraordinary lengths to protect the citizens of Gaza. Israelis made thousands of calls to Gazans\u2019 cell-phones and blanketed Gaza by air with leaflets in Arabic telling them where to flee to safety \u2014 while their own leaders from Hamas shot at them to keep them from leaving, and, later, to stop them from taking humanitarian aid.\n\nThe Biden administration, while having been immensely helpful in sending aircraft carriers to the region \u2013presumably as a deterrent to keep the war from spreading \u2014 now appears to be trying to dictate to Israel how it should fight its war. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, however, assured Israel that the US will not limit the timeline it needs to complete is mission.\n\nBiden has also helpfully ignored requests from \u201cDemocratic Senators\u201d to withhold military support for Israel if it does not approve humanitarian aid for Gaza, unfortunately meaning for Hamas, who appropriate it (here, here , here , here and here).\n\nTrying to establish a \u201cpeace plan\u201d that is bound to bring more war \u2014 especially against the will of the country, Israel, that would be directly affected by a \u201cpeace plan\u201d \u2014 is acting against Israel. Attempting to create a Palestinian state against the will of Israel is not helpful to anyone \u2013 least of all the Palestinians who would be condemned to live under a corrupt and dismissive leadership. Recent Palestinian opinion polls show that nearly 90% say they want Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, now in the 19th year of his four-year term in office, out.\n\nAny peace plan established in this way is destined to fail: peace, as agreed to by both the Israelis and the Palestinians in the 1993 Oslo Accord, can only be achieved by agreement between the two parties involved. Israeli leaders have offered peace many times as well as immense concessions. Each time, the Palestinian leaders have refused, without even a counteroffer.\n\nThe attempt to create a Palestinian state is also, unfortunately, destined to fail: Israeli leaders have proposed the creation of a Palestinian state several times, and each time the Palestinian leaders were offered one, they refused. The Palestinian leaders have, in fact, been admirably clear: They do not want a state alongside Israel, they want a state instead of Israel.\n\nEven now, according to the journalist Daniel Greenfield, Palestinian terrorists in Moscow are working to create a \u201ctechnocratic government\u201d: \u201ca front for the terrorists and composed of nonprofit executives, academics, economists and others who have experience dealing with the international community and extracting foreign aid from them\u201d:\n\nHamas, will not officially be part of the puppet regime, but will control the puppets.\u201d Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom told The Financial Times. \u201cAbout Hamas \u2014 there are ongoing discussions . . . but this government is a technocratic government, it\u2019s not made of any political factions, because this is not the time for political factions.\u201d That\u2019s what the Biden administration and the EU want to hear, but while Qatar is helping assemble a new \u2018technocratic\u2019 front for the terrorists, the Moscow summit made it clear that the real agenda of the new government would be terror against Israel and the U.S. The Moscow summit revealed that a technocratic government will not end terrorism, it will disguise it, and it will not end the conflict, it will escalate it. A \u201cPalestinian\u201d state, the terrorist groups have already announced, will be a terror state.\n\nThe Biden administration, regrettably, sometimes seems to have a way of ignoring what they do not want to hear or see (as with America\u2019s open borders), and apparently all past failures (Afghanistan, inflation, immigration) and their consequences.\n\nIn the Middle East, every time Israeli leaders have had illusions about Palestinian leaders or given in to foreign pressure, devastating terrorist acts have followed: hijacked airliners , the Munich Olympics massacre, hijacking the Achille Lauro ship, where the Palestinians pushed the elderly, wheelchair-bound Leon Klinghoffer into the sea; the Sbarro pizzeria bombing , the Caf\u00e9 Hillel bombing, the Park Hotel bombing, and several murderous intifadas (uprisings). The so-called \u201cpeace process\u201d that followed the Oslo Accords led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority which quickly became a base for continuous anti-Israeli terrorism, and a wave of bloody attacks that, until October 7, was interrupted only by constructing a security barrier.\n\nIf elections were held today, polls show, Palestinians would vote overwhelmingly for Hamas. Any Palestinian Arab leader that signs a peace treaty with Israel today would only be seen as a traitor and be lynched. The aim of the Palestinian leadership at the moment, as Greenfield points out, is probably how to keep the money coming in.\n\nOn February 23, Blinken said that Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank is \u201cinconsistent with international law\u201d \u2014 a clear step back from the position expressed by then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2019: \u201cJudea and Samaria are rightful parts of the Jewish homeland, and Israelis have a right to live there\u201d.\n\nThree weeks earlier, Biden signed an executive order allowing sanctions on Israeli settlers (and potentially Israeli politicians) alleged to have been involved in violence against Palestinians \u2014 after 5,600 terrorist attacks were carried out against Israelis in 2023. During the same period, Israelis carried out 60 acts of violence against Palestinians, largely to defend themselves against aggressors. The Biden administration punished the defensive acts of Israelis who were attacked, not their attackers.\n\nThe Biden administration, citing the risks of famine, has been insisting on sending more humanitarian aid to Gaza even though most of it is captured by Hamas and given to its terrorists, enabling them to prolong the war. When civilians come near the aid supplies, Hamas shoots. More aid just means more aid for Hamas.\n\nThe US is about to build a pier in Gaza to bring in more humanitarian aid with the help of the United Arab Emirates. However it is not clear how they plan to prevent Hamas from commandeering the additional aid.\n\nGaza hospitals are overcrowded. Many Gazan civilians could be treated if they could get out of the Gaza Strip. The Egyptian government opposes this. It has had its own run-ins with terrorists and additionally can recall all too well how in 1970, the Palestinians showed their appreciation for the hospitality of King Hussein of Jordan. In a slaughter called Black September, they tried to overthrow and assassinate him.\n\nEgypt depends largely on American financial aid and the Biden administration has leverage on its government, but the Biden administration has not pressured the Egyptian government. It appears as if the US has been bending to the wishes of Iran and Hamas, who refuse to allow Gaza civilians to leave the Gaza Strip and instead keep them in the zone of conflict as human shields. If they are killed, Israel will wrongly be blamed, not Hamas. Several countries have offered to welcome civilians from Gaza: Turkey, Canada, Chechnya. \u201cThe United States,\u201d Blinken announced, \u201cunequivocally rejects any proposals advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo survive\u201d, President Biden said on February 26, \u201cIsrael must take opportunity for peace, security with Palestinians\u2026. I think that if we get that temporary ceasefire, we\u2019re going to be able to move in a direction where we can change the dynamic\u201d.\n\nPolls show that most Israelis know that the survival of Israel is at stake. They do not think for a moment that there is any opportunity for peace and they definitely do not want to \u201cchange the dynamic\u201d. Israelis have not forgotten October 7 which Netanyahu has compared to \u201ctwenty 9/11s\u201d . The Israeli people, according to reports, are unified in seeing that that without the destruction of Hamas as a political and military threat, Israel will not be safe.\n\nThey understand that if Hamas survives the war, its leaders will declare victory and the threats to Israel will only worsen.\n\nIsraelis are also well aware that the real threat to Israel is the regime of Iran, which, despite denials, clearly helped plan the attack. Even though its proxy militias in Iraq and Syria have since Oct. 7 launched more than 150 attacks on American troops, the Biden administration still refuses to hold Iran to account. Another of Iran\u2019s proxies, Hezbollah, which boasts at least 150,000 missiles aimed at Israel, a country the size of New Jersey, continues to fire missiles into the north of Israel \u2014 100 in one recent day \u2014 to make life there unlivable.\n\nThe Biden administration just gave up trying to put in place a ceasefire lasting six weeks in exchange for just some of the hostages held by Hamas \u2013 the women and children \u2014 and the release of 10 terrorists imprisoned in Israel for each freed hostage. When Hamas refused to provide the names of the hostages still alive, the deal collapsed .\n\nAny ceasefire would just give Hamas the opportunity to resupply and reorganize itself , and the released terrorists would quickly go back to being terrorists again. Hamas\u2019s demands to free the remaining hostages would undoubtedly keep growing higher.\n\nThe Biden administration could easily rescind the 10-year lease of America\u2019s Al Udeid Airbase in Qatar tomorrow \u2014 it renewed the lease in January, presumably in exchange for nothing \u2014 and see all the hostages home by this weekend.\n\nConcerned groups could also demonstrate against Qatar as a state sponsor of terrorism, as advised by Yigal Carmon, the founder and president of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI):\n\n\u201cThey [families of the hostages] can raise hell for the release of their loved ones \u2013 in media, in Congress, and by demonstrating in front of the Embassy of Qatar on M Street in Washington, D.C. Qatar is extremely and incredibly sensitive to being exposed in any way as a terror-sponsoring state\u2026 \u201cMany Americans believe that they owe Qatar for its hosting of the U.S. CENTCOM base. The truth is precisely the opposite: It is Qatar that owes the U.S., for locating this base there. Without this base\u2019s presence in the country, Qatar would disappear within less than a week \u2013 its neighbors would eat it up. \u201cA single statement by a U.S. Department of Defense official, about relocating \u2013 or even considering relocating \u2013 this base from Qatar to another country that is not a state sponsor of terrorism is all it would take to get the American hostages released. Even indicating that the U.S. has other options besides Qatar would do it.\u201d\n\nAlthough purportedly negotiating the release of the hostages, Qatar is not an honest broker. Far from being a \u201cMajor Non-NATO Ally\u201d, as Biden quixotically anointed it, Qatar is a state sponsor of terrorism, from Al-Qaeda to Al Shaabab to the Taliban to the Al Nusra Front \u201cand even ISIS,\u201d according to former US Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Qatar should be designated as such. Qatar has backed Hamas since it ousted the Palestinian Authority from the Gaza Strip in 2007. Qatar has been Hamas\u2019s main funder, providing more than $1.8 billion since 2007. Hamas is Qatar\u2019s pet; Qatar most likely does not want Hamas to lose the war and is sure to do all it can to secure that result.\n\nIsrael\u2019s government, which reportedly continues to receive valuable intelligence from the interrogation of terrorists it has apprehended so far, says it still needs go into Rafah, the last part of southern Gaza. It is believed Hamas\u2019s terrorist leaders might be hiding there, moving through the endless tunnels, and keeping hostages with them as human shields.\n\nThe Biden administration, for its part, sometimes seems frustrated by Israel\u2019s determination to act as a sovereign nation in deciding what is best for its security, rather than being a vassal of the US. On January 7, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper reported that a Biden administration official told him that Netanyahu will have to choose between his coalition and his ties to the United States.\n\nThe Biden administration has tried to circumvent Netanyahu and create political divisions in Israel during the war. Last month, a political rival of Netanyahu, Benny Gantz, whom Netanyahu had brought into his war cabinet, made an unauthorized visit to Washington, at the invitation of the Biden administration, for \u201cpolicy meetings\u201d \u2014 without Netanyahu\u2019s agreement and without coordinating his plans with the Israeli government.\n\nNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell wrote that senior U.S. officials said that the Biden administration is looking past Netanyahu to try to achieve his goals in the region. It appears that the Biden administration would like to trade Netanyahu in for a doormat who would agree to a terrorist Palestinian state next door, a Hamas victory in Gaza and Iran having nuclear weapons.\n\nOn March 14, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) actually called for ousting the democratically elected Prime Minister Netanyahu and proposed new elections \u2013 as if it were his prerogative to tell the government of another sovereign nation how to conduct its internal affairs. The impropriety shocked even the usually shock-resistant Washington DC. \u201cChuck Schumer\u2019s demand for new Israeli elections is inappropriate and offensive\u201d, Senator Tom Cotton. (R-Arkansas) shot back. \u201cThe last thing Israel needs is the \u2018foreign election interference\u2019 that Democrats so often decry here\u201d.\n\nNetanyahu, meanwhile, is not giving in, and his governing coalition is solid. Israel also benefits from strong support from the American people. A recent poll shows that 82% of Americans support Israel in its fight against Hamas, 67% think that a ceasefire should happen only after the release of all hostages and Hamas being removed from power, and 78% think that Hamas must be removed from running Gaza.\n\nBiden\u2019s most recent comment, after saying that he would have a \u201ccome-to-Jesus meeting\u201d with Netanyahu, later emphasized that there is \u201cno red line\u201d and that he will \u201cnever leave\u201d Israel without support.\n\nSince then, however, the Daily Mail noted:\n\n\u201cI have been asked by a serious administration figure what it is that will force the Netanyahu coalition to collapse,\u201d the Israel expert told New York Magazine. \u201cThey were interested in the mechanics, what can we demand which will collapse his coalition.\u201d\n\nSchumer said that Netanyahu, democratically elected by a sovereign nation, must step down and Israel must hold new elections. Biden immediately agreed with him.\n\nThe incident reportedly served to unite more Israelis behind Netanyahu. According to columnist Caroline Glick:\n\n\u201cTo win, Israel must do three things. It must remain politically stable. Schumer\u2019s broadside from the Senate floor was just the latest salvo in an all-out effort by the administration to destabilize Israel politically and replace Netanyahu with his chief rival Benny Gantz, whom they believe will agree to capitulate and accept the formation of a Palestinian state. Minister-without-Portfolio Gideon Sa\u2019ar\u2019s decision on Tuesday to ditch Gantz\u2019s party and take his faction\u2019s four Knesset seats into the coalition speaks to the near consensus view in Israel that Netanyahu is the only leader that will fight to victory despite U.S. opposition. Last Wednesday, a new Direct Polls survey showed that U.S. hostility has strengthened Netanyahu and the right. Netanyahu leads Gantz 47 % to 37% in public support. His right-religious bloc of parties, (including Sa\u2019ar) is polling a 62 seat-majority to Gantz\u2019s leftist bloc of parties\u2019 48 seats.\u201d\n\nThat item, however, was followed shortly by another assessment by Greenfield in \u201cBiden\u2019s \u2018Trojan Pier\u2019 for Gaza\u201d: that a new, \u201ctemporary\u201d pier being built by the US to help humanitarian aid into Gaza, is actually anything but:\n\n\u201cThe temporary pier setup is about bypassing Israel to provide long term access to Gaza. \u201cWhile administration officials describe the pier as \u201ctemporary\u201d, a senior official also admitted that \u201cwe look forward to the port transitioning to a commercially operated facility over time.\u201d \u201cThat means it\u2019s not actually meant to be temporary, but a permanent port for the terrorists\u2026 \u201cThe Pentagon spokesman emphasized, however, that American forces would not be on the ground, would not be in a position to secure the aid deliveries or stop Hamas from taking them\u2026.. \u201cThe Biden administration claims that it personally will not put troops on the ground in Gaza, but there\u2019s no word on whether other nations might do so. The Pentagon has claimed that security arrangements are still being discussed with partner nations. And some of those partner nations could include Hamas allies like Qatar or Turkey. Any armed foreign nation entering Gaza would amount to an invasion of Israeli territory with the ultimate aim of aiding the terrorists living on it\u2026 \u201cBeyond any immediate MREs, the causeway will be inevitably used to move supplies for the \u201creconstruction\u201d of Gaza as part of a new \u201cPalestinian State\u201d. \u201cThe Biden administration is creating a gateway to Gaza that Israel isn\u2019t supposed to control. \u201cThe Trojan pier is not only about bypassing Israel, but also Egypt. The administration\u2019s vision is that the new arrangement will allow it to directly move materials into Gaza without having to get permission from either Israel or Egypt. And that\u2019s a major victory for the terrorists\u2026. \u201cOnce the system is in place and if Israel has been pressured into withdrawing, it gives the terrorists a direct connection to their allies on the outside. And that includes so-called humanitarian groups\u2026\u201dBiden\u2019s actions are a violation of Israel\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt a certain point in the not-so-distant future, wrote Glick, \u201cNetanyahu will need to say \u2018no\u2019 to the administration. It can only be hoped that the vast majority of Americans, who stand with Israel against its enemies, will stand with Israel when we arrive at that point\u201d.",

            "text": "Gov. DeSantis signed bill that prevents homeless camping in public spaces Gov. DeSantis signed bill that prevents homeless camping in public spaces 02:28\n\nMIAMI BEACH - Florida's homeless will be banned from sleeping on sidewalks and in parks and other public spaces under a law signed Wednesday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. It also promises the homeless greater access to services for issues such as substance abuse and mental health problems.\n\nThe state Department of Children and Families would oversee local governments that set up designated areas for the homeless to camp for up to a year under the new law, which takes effect Oct. 1. Anyone using those encampments would be prohibited from using alcohol or illegal drugs, with sanitation and security to be provided.\n\nThe encampments would be created if local homeless shelters reach maximum capacity. The law requires regional entities to provide necessary behavioral treatment access as a condition of a county or city creating an encampment.\n\nAllowing the homeless to camp in public spaces affects the local quality of life, can be a nuisance for businesses and makes it more difficult to deliver them needed services because they're scattered, DeSantis and other supporters of the measure said at a news conference in Miami Beach.\n\n\"I think this is absolutely the right balance to strike,\" DeSantis said. \"We want to make sure we put public safety above all else.\"\n\nMiami Beach passed a similar resolution back in October of last year. Miami Beach Mayor Stephen Meiner called the ordinance passionate legislation.\n\n\"It helps people. It's increasing funding for shelters. It's increasing funding for mental health treatment. It's increasing funding for substance abuse treatment. This will absolutely help people,\" he said.\n\nRon Book with the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust said the county has done a good job of managing the homeless population.\n\n\"The numbers of individuals experiencing homelessness all across America are going up, except in Miami-Dade County, where we continue to manage the population, moving people in and off the street in an expeditious fashion,\" he said.\n\nBook said the legislation needs to go one step further.\n\n\"This is but one piece to the puzzle. Hopefully, shortly, the governor will also sign the changes that were made to the Baker Act that begin to address behavioral health issues that we know we have with homeless individuals in our state,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Legislature's latest session, Florida's homeless population was estimated to be about 30,700 in 2023. That's a fraction of the homeless populations in many large U.S. cities, but the law's sponsors said it could worsen because of Florida's rapid population growth.\n\n\"This bill will not eliminate homelessness. But it is a start,\" said Republican state Rep. Sam Garrison. \"And it states clearly that in Florida, our public spaces are worth fighting for.\"\n\nOpponents of the law say it is meant to round up the homeless and hide them from public view.\n\n\"This bill does not and it will not address the more pressing and root cause of homelessness,\" said Democratic state Sen. Shevrin Jones during a debate this year. \"We are literally reshuffling the visibility of unhoused individuals with no exit strategy for people who are experiencing homelessness.\"\n\nDeSantis, however, said the new law is a unique approach in pledging to provide the services that homeless people often need.\n\n\"This is going to require that the services are there to help people get back on their feet,\" the governor said. \"I think it's important that we maintain the quality of life for the citizens of Florida.\"\n\nBeginning in January 2025, the law will allow residents, local business owners and the state attorney general to file a lawsuit to stop any city or county from allowing the homeless to camp or sleep on public property.",

            "text": "The U.S. Department of Justice filed a landmark lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing it of monopolizing the smartphone market.\n\nThe civil suit, joined by attorneys general for 15 states and the District of Columbia, accuses Apple of restricting its smartphone operating system in a way that drives up costs for consumers and prevents developers from successfully releasing products on other smartphone systems.\n\n\u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news release.\n\nAmong the suit's allegations:\n\nApple prevents the successful deployment of what the DOJ calls \"super apps\" that would make it easier for consumers to switch between smartphone platforms.\n\nApple blocks the development of cloud-streaming apps that would allow for high-quality video-game play without having to pay for extra hardware.\n\nApple inhibits the development of cross-platform messaging apps so that customers must keep buying iPhones. The DOJ specifically highlights the frequent consumer complaint of seeing a message sent from a non-iPhone device show up as green instead of the standard iMessage blue \u2014 and with fewer features than one sent between two iMessage users.\n\nIn a press conference Thursday following the release of the suit, Garland acknowledged Apple's dominance as a company \u2014 noting its market capitalization was larger than the GDP of more than 100 countries \u2014 but that this success was not the result of its superior products, but rather through its \"exclusionary\" tactics.\n\nApple's performance, he said, has come \"not by making its own products better, but by making other products worse.\"\n\nIn a statement, Apple denied the allegations and accused the government of overreach.\n\nIt said it was under no obligation to use designs or policies that may be preferred by competitors, especially when those designs would make iPhone users\u2019 experience worse.\n\nFor example, Apple said, it has not developed a version of iMessage compatible with non-iPhone devices because it would not be able to provide a comparable user experience that meets the company's standards.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2014designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\" it said. \"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect. It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.\u201d\n\nThe case is part of President Joe Biden\u2019s broader antitrust crackdown on Big Tech. The U.S. Justice Department is already suing Google for allegedly monopolizing digital advertising services, while the Federal Trade Commission has a long-running anti-monopoly case pending against Facebook parent Meta, as well as a more recent one against Amazon. And in December, the Federal Trade Commission sought to block Microsoft\u2019s now-closed acquisition of game maker Activision.\n\nThe suit against Apple represents the third attempt by an attorney general to go after the Cupertino, California-based tech behemoth \u2014 but the first to challenge Apple on such a broad basis.\n\n\u201cThis clearly escalates the Biden Administration antitrust efforts against Big Tech giants and adds to the current ongoing antitrust case against Google and other various cases against Meta and Amazon,\u201d Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in an investor note.\n\nThe complaint goes on to allege that Apple\u2019s monopoly also extends to web browsers, video communication, news subscriptions, entertainment, automotive services, advertising, location services and more.\n\n\u201cFor years, Apple responded to competitive threats by imposing a series of \u2018Whac-A-Mole\u2019 contractual rules and restrictions that have allowed Apple to extract higher prices from consumers, impose higher fees on developers and creators, and to throttle competitive alternatives from rival technologies,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division. \u201cToday\u2019s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Chamber of Progress, a trade group funded by tech companies like Apple, criticized the suit.\n\n\u201cConsumers who buy iPhones like Apple\u2019s highly curated mobile ecosystem,\u201d said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. \u201cThat\u2019s not an antitrust violation, that\u2019s why millions of people buy iPhones for security and ease of use. If DOJ forced Apple to open up its software and hardware, it would make iPhones more like Androids, depriving consumers of choice between two very different types of device.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Apple was hit with a $2 billion fine by the European Union for restricting competition for music-streaming services in the app store. Apple said it would appeal.\n\nThe full lawsuit is below.",

Why, then, did Hunter yell at CEFC Executive Director Zang in front of his entourage as I sat right next to him in New York City on Sunday May 7th, 2017? Hunter was adamant that he was owed the rest of the $20 Million CEFC had committed to paying for the work he had claimed he had done in prior years.\"In the second instance, Bobulinski argued that Hunter Biden lied when he claimed that Joe Biden never interacted with Hunter\u2019s associates:\"On Page 48 of his transcript, Hunter is asked, 'He\u2019s never interacted with any of your business associates. Is that correct?' The 'He\u2019s' is a reference to Joe Biden. Hunter responds, 'Yes'. Hunter arranged the meeting between his father and me at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles on May 2, 2017. The sole reason Hunter wanted me to meet his father was because I was the CEO of Sinohawk, the Bidens\u2019 partnership with CEFC. I was a business associate. In his transcript, Hunter confirms that that meeting with Joe took place and incriminates his Uncle Jim for perjury by confirming it.\"In the third example, Bobulinski said Hunter \u201clied\u201d about leveraging Joe Biden to receive a $5 million payment from CEFC:\"Hunter lied to the Committee about important details concerning his money demands and threats to CEFC on July 30 and July 31, 2017. He leveraged his father\u2019s presence next to him in that infamous text in order to strong-arm CEFC into paying Hunter immediately and in the process defrauded the partners of Sinohawk Holdings LLC and Oneida Holdings LLC. The threat worked, as a few days later the Chinese wired $5 million dollars into a company of which Hunter owned 50%. It\u2019s important to remember that CEFC considered this money an interest-free loan to the 'Biden family,' and planned to send more. I have the email from CEFC to prove it.\"Bobulinski also said Joe Biden was \u201cmore than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business\u201d but \u201cwas an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\u201d\u201cIf there is no evidence of corruption \u2013 if Joe\u2019s conduct and the conduct of his family were fully legal and proper \u2013 then why are they so dishonest about it?\u201d Bobulinski asked. \u201cNot just slight misrepresentations of fact but deep untruths about the entire corrupt enterprise.\u201dSouth Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace fired off an intense round of \"yes or no\" questions aimed at Joe Biden's involvement in his son's business dealings.Mace directed her questions to Bobulinski and another ex-Hunter Biden business associate, Jason Galanis, asking them to verify various interactions with Biden, Hunter and the business associates concerning various deals and transactions.Those interactions included Joe Biden taking calls from Hunter where he updated his dad on certain business deals, confirming a reserved board seat for Joe Biden at a company, that Joe Biden lied when he denied meeting with Hunter's business partners, and that the family received money from Chinese business interests.Bobulinski and Galanis answered \"yes\" to each of Mace's questions.\"Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed that he was not involved in Hunter Biden's, Jim Biden's, or any other Biden family business deals. Today our witnesses have proved otherwise,\" Mace said at the conclusion of her questioning.Bobulinski also directly confronted two Democrat members of the Oversight Committee, accusing them of lying in the media about the impeachment inquiry. \"Representatives Dan Goldman and Jamie Raskin, both lawyers, and Mr. Goldman a former prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, will continue to lie today in this hearing and then go straight to the media to tell more lies,\" he said in his opening statement.\n\nYour Choice\n\nFree Press International\n\n[\n\nPublish This Content\n\n]",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don\u2019t show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won\u2019t be made until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dumpster fire\u2019 \u2013\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers\u2019 bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump\u2019s Save America political action committee \u2014 money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters \u2014 and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\u201d a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E.

( The lawsuit )\n\nToday's topic.\n\nThe 32-hour workweek. Last Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced a bill to federally mandate a 32-hour workweek. Sanders\u2019s bill is the Senate companion to a bill introduced by Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) in the House, the Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act , which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to reduce the standard workweek from 40 hours to 32, lowering the maximum hours threshold for overtime pay for non-exempt employees. Those exempt would include computer professionals, farmworkers, sales employees, and many other occupations . The proposal follows the United Auto Workers (UAW) strikes in the fall, where one of the labor demands was for a 32-hour workweek.\n\nTakano, a senior member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, credits technological advances , especially in artificial intelligence, with increasing efficiency enough to allow workers to put in less time to produce the same results. \u201cWe have choices to make as a society about whether we are going to allow technology to put us in the service of it or whether it really serves all of us, and I mean all of us,\u201d Takano said.\n\nSanders garnered attention for his bill last week with a hearing in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which he chairs. He said the proposed worktime reductions would be phased in over four years. \u201cDo we continue the trend that technology only benefits the people on top, or do we demand that these transformational changes benefit working people?\" Sanders asked.\n\nThe proposal faced both support and opposition in the hearing . \"If this policy is implemented, it would threaten the millions of small businesses already operating on razor-thin margins, in part because they are unable to find enough workers,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA). \"Employers would be forced to eliminate full-time positions in favor of part-time ones.\"\n\nA recent survey from Morning Consult found that 87% of employed U.S. adults would be interested in a four-day workweek. However, the Senate bill is not likely to gain the necessary 60 votes to pass the divided Senate, nor is Takano\u2019s bill expected to pass a Republican-controlled House. The 32-hour workweek faces stiff opposition not just from most Republicans but also from some financial experts , who say that the proposed changes could hurt blue-collar workers and manufacturing industries. Other economists , though, argue that a shortened workweek would improve worker productivity.\n\nA recent pilot study of 61 companies in the United Kingdom found that a four-day workweek significantly increased employee morale, decreased burnout, and improved employee retention. 92% of companies who participated in the pilot program voluntarily adopted a 32-hour workweek.\n\nSome economists have cast doubt on the results of the UK study, noting that it wasn\u2019t peer-reviewed and participating companies shortened the workweek by only 7% on average. Others suggest that these pilot programs tend to only include employers who were already inclined to try a shorter week, limiting the accuracy of their findings.\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at the arguments about the proposal from the right and left, then I\u2019ll give my take.\n\nWhat the right is saying.\n\nThe right opposes the proposal, arguing it\u2019s out of touch with economic reality.\n\nSome say it would cause costs to rise for everyone.\n\nOthers suggest working fewer hours won\u2019t make workers happier.\n\nNational Review\u2019s editors wrote about \u201cBernie\u2019s 32-hour work week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is Sanders\u2019s plan to contribute to the great human endeavor of becoming wealthier while working less? Does he have an idea for the next automobile, a better management strategy, or the power loom for the 22nd century?,\u201d the editors asked. \u201cNo, Sanders wants to write words on a page and have a couple hundred people vote for it\u2026 That\u2019s Sanders\u2019s idea of progress. Pass a law that says everyone gets paid the same for doing less work, and then it happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could easily produce 1950s levels of output only working a few hours per week. But that would mean 1950s levels of technology, 1950s levels of poverty, 1950s levels of housing, 1950s levels of air-conditioning, 1950s levels of food quality and variety \u2014 and it turns out nobody really wants that. So we keep working, and innovating, so we can be better off, not just as well off,\u201d the editors wrote. \u201cMaybe if you\u2019re an 82-year-old socialist who has only worked in politics your entire life, you lose touch with what it means to be a productive member of society.\u201d\n\nIn The Washington Examiner, Brad Polumbo said \u201cBernie Sanders unveils his latest insane idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might sound dreamy, but like so many of Sanders\u2019s bold plans that promise to make everything better with no meaningful downsides, it\u2019s actually a harebrained idea that would backfire tremendously,\u201d Polumbo wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Any economic change has significant trade-offs, and you can\u2019t get around them just by writing legislation that says everything has to work out great for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis change would constitute an enormous increase in costs for many employers and businesses. And it\u2019s just basic economics that when businesses\u2019 costs go up, they have to raise their prices. Workers aren\u2019t actually going to be better off if everything they consume gets more expensive. Regardless, while the federal government could try to prohibit employers from reducing current workers\u2019 wages in light of this legislation, that wouldn\u2019t really work. After all, employers will still presumably be free to offer lower wages for all new hires.\u201d\n\nIn PJ Media, Rick Moran asked \u201cwould reducing the workweek to 32 hours make workers happier?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's no doubt this would be a popular piece of legislation with many workers. And Sanders, surprisingly, makes some good points about why the change would be beneficial,\u201d Moran said. But \u201cthere is absolutely no empirical evidence that a shorter workweek relieves stress and makes workers happier\u2026 however many hours an employee puts in, the work has to get done. I doubt whether relieving stress levels would be measurable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWork has, indeed, changed radically. There is a lot less physical exertion, and, in fact, machines do most of our heavy lifting and thinking. To relieve stress, I suggest looking at home life as well. There are far more stressors at home than in most workplaces. And a 32-hour workweek isn't going to fix that,\u201d Moran added. \u201cThis proposal would sound the death knell of American economic supremacy. Let's make sure we understand that before taking the leap to a 32-hour workweek.\u201d\n\nWhat the left is saying.\n\nThe left is mixed on the proposal, with supporters arguing it\u2019s a necessary move for a modern workforce.\n\nSome disagree, saying companies will make this change themselves if it\u2019s truly in workers\u2019 best interest.\n\nOthers say the proposal\u2019s growing popularity shows our changing societal values.\n\nIn The Washington Post, Sen. Bernie Sanders and United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain made \u201cthe case for a 32-hour workweek with no loss in pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, American workers are more than 400 percent more productive than they were in the 1940s. And yet, despite this fact, millions of our people are working longer hours for lower wages. In fact, 28.5 million Americans now work over 60 hours a week, and more than half of full-time employees work more than 40 hours a week,\u201d Sanders and Fain said. \u201cDespite these long hours, the average worker in America makes almost $50 a week less than he or she did 50 years ago, after adjusting for inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about all the incredible advancements in technology \u2014 computers, robotics, artificial intelligence \u2014 and the huge increase in worker productivity that has been achieved. What have been the results of these changes for working people? Almost all the economic gains have gone straight to the top, while wages for workers are stagnant or worse,\u201d Sanders and Fain wrote. \u201cWhile CEOs are making nearly 400 times as much as their average employees, many workers are seeing their family lives fall apart\u2026 This should not be happening in the United States of America in 2024.\u201d\n\nIn Inc. Magazine, Suzanne Lucas said \u201cno matter how popular this bill seems, the chances of it becoming law are slim to none.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanders says he wants to pass this 4-day workweek bill to force companies to share profits with their employees and bring Americans into line with other wealthy nations,\u201d Lucas wrote. \u201cEmployees in other countries may look like they work a lot fewer hours per week--workers in Copenhagen, Denmark, for instance, clock in at 1,380 hours per year, which is a dramatic difference. But they also have a standard 37-hour work week, with an average of 33 hours per week actually worked\u2014a 3.4-hour difference.\n\n\u201cWhy is the overall number so much lower? Vacation. Danes are entitled to a minimum of five weeks of vacation per year for full-time employees. Most Europeans enjoy real time off like this. U.S. law doesn't have any mandatory vacations, although some states require paid sick time,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cMany people want to work fewer hours, but businesses tend to want full-time employees to work 40 hours\u2026 If this is truly better for everyone, companies will adopt it on their own. No new law needed.\u201d\n\nIn The New York Times, Binyamin Appelbaum called the 32-hour workweek \u201cthe magic number.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans spend too much time on the job. A shorter workweek would be better for our health, better for our families and better for our employers, who would reap the benefits of a more motivated and better-rested work force. Other countries may seek an advantage in the global marketplace by wringing every drop of labor from their workers; American companies have to be more productive, and that means taking better care of their workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the 40-hour week may feel like an immutable law of nature, it\u2019s barely a century old. American workers fought to establish the eight-hour workday around the turn of the last century, campaigning on the catchy slogan \u2018Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what you will,\u2019\u201d Appelbaum wrote. \u201cThe revival of the idea partly reflects a shift in societal priorities. Americans have become more protective of their health, more inclined to define themselves in terms of their lives outside work \u2014 and perhaps more willing to accept leisure as a substitute for higher pay.\u201d\n\nMy take.\n\nReminder: \"My take\" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, don't unsubscribe. Write in by replying to this email, or leave a comment.\n\nIt\u2019ll never pass, but there are good reasons to adopt a 32-hour workweek.\n\nIf you have a business that can get the same amount of productivity for less time, then go for it.\n\nBut not all businesses can, so I don\u2019t think this proposal makes sense as a piece of top-down federal legislation.\n\nI just don\u2019t see how a 32-hour workweek can happen.\n\nSanders\u2019s proposal is not going to make it through a divided Senate, and Takano\u2019s is essentially dead on arrival in the House. The federal government isn\u2019t going to enact a 32-hour workweek, and I don\u2019t think it should. But that doesn\u2019t mean the idea is totally without merit, either.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what the proposal gets right. Workers are more productive now and are getting paid less \u2014 Sanders isn\u2019t pulling those numbers out of thin air. According to the St. Louis Fed, worker productivity since 1955 has increased by about 400% , and over the same period average inflation-adjusted income has decreased \u2014 despite income inequality dropping in the last year.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that other countries do require fewer hours per week. Denmark, for example, has a 37-hour workweek , as well as more maternity and paternity leave and a culture where more paid time off is expected. And there is evidence to suggest that companies that enact a four-day workweek can maintain the same level of productivity with happier and healthier employees.\n\nIn simple terms, the proposal makes sense. Technological advances have helped workers make productivity gains and helped companies make more money, but the amount that workers get paid per time worked hasn\u2019t increased. Instead of fixing that by making hourly pay go up, why not keep their pay the same and make the number of hours go down? Workers who make enough would be happier because they would spend less time at work, those who don\u2019t make enough would have more time for a second job; and if companies get the same level of productivity, then what\u2019s the problem?\n\nThat brings us to what the proposal gets wrong. First, I don\u2019t see how this helps with worker wages. If we make it so full-time workers are making the same amount a year but are just working less, how is that putting more money in the pockets of most Americans? You could argue that it frees them up for more part-time work, but like Sanders said, a lot of people who need the money are already working second jobs. I can see the argument that working less is just better for health and stress levels, and that\u2019s fine, but I don\u2019t think you can really argue it\u2019s better for the average person\u2019s bottom line.\n\nIn fact, it might be worse. A shortened workweek might make sense for white-collar workplaces, but I don\u2019t see how it makes sense for manufacturing or construction companies. Imagine a construction company where 50 employees are paid a fixed amount for 40 hours a week. If suddenly that company has to pay the same employees for 32 hours of work instead, what do you think will happen? Either 50 employees are going to get eight hours of overtime pay, increasing the cost of construction at a time when housing prices are at all-time highs, or 100 employees are going to work 20 hours a week \u2014 meaning 50 people lose their benefits while 50 newer, less efficient workers are brought on, also without benefits. Either way, an increase in housing costs or a decrease in worker benefits isn\u2019t a good outcome.\n\nThe U.K. pilot study of 61 companies quoted so often by 32-hour workweek supporters reflects this problem, too. Of those companies, seven were in manufacturing and construction, and none of the construction companies were quoted or showcased in the report. Meanwhile, only one manufacturing company \u2014 a craft brewery \u2014 was highlighted.\n\nThat study had other problems, too. First off, it isn\u2019t definitive. Other studies have shown that the length of the workweek isn\u2019t behind most workplace issues. It also wasn\u2019t peer-reviewed, it was financed by an organization called \u201c4 Day Week Global\u201d (meaning its methods are likely biased), it included only organizations interested in adopting a four-day workweek (biasing its results further), and it only collected data about stress levels at the workplace. While trying to mitigate stress is a worthy cause, there\u2019s not much evidence that the number of hours we work is a significant driver: About 75% of U.S. adults reported experiencing stress in their lives, while in Scandinavian countries \u2014 where it\u2019s more common to work fewer hours \u2014 it\u2019s closer to 80% .\n\nSimply put, I don\u2019t think legislating a top-down 32-hour workweek is going to be a magic bullet to eliminate stress, I don\u2019t think it makes for smart policy, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be good for every industry \u2014 or for every company in the industries where it could work best. I know that with the amount of work we have to do every week at Tangle, I\u2019m not exactly champing at the bit to try it out.\n\nBut I could see it working for a lot of other places. Advertising agencies, law firms, even small businesses and storefronts \u2014 if you can actually achieve the same amount of productivity for less work, then you should by all means do it. And I think Sanders and Takano mainstreaming this issue and making it part of a broader discussion could result in that change coming faster to those workplaces where it makes sense. Then maybe, down the road, it would make sense in more and more industries.\n\nI just don\u2019t think we\u2019re there now. Like another signature Sanders position, the $15 federal minimum wage he ran on in 2016 , I think it\u2019s a nice talking point that makes sense for some industries but wouldn\u2019t make sense as a matter of overarching federal policy. Until more U.S. companies try this out across every sector, there just isn\u2019t enough reason to support a government-mandated change of this magnitude.\n\nTake the poll: What do you think of the 32-hour workweek?

Sounds like a no win!\n\n\u2014 Ray from Staunton, Virginia\n\nTangle: A lot of the issues we cover have moderate positions to stake out that take elements from each side of a debate. Some issues are ones where moderate positions are still very possible, but maintaining a consistent viewpoint makes it hard to meet in the middle. Abortion is one of those issues. Taxation is another.\n\nIf you believe that we are better off with less government, that means you want to see lower taxes, fewer agencies and employees, and fewer investments in government services and entitlement programs. If you believe in more government, that means more taxation, more federal workers, and more investment in government services and entitlement programs.\n\nI think that\u2019s where your second point actually provides a really good visualization. There\u2019s an economic concept called the Laffer Curve , which says that the more you tax a population the less prosperous the people are, meaning that over time you actually get less from them. It also means the opposite \u2014 the less you tax a population, the less you get in taxes. So, in theory, there\u2019s a happy medium of ideal taxation. But every increase in taxation past that point gives diminishing returns, and actually hurts the population.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree at all with that. And to be honest, I\u2019m more ideologically prone towards smaller government and less taxation. But I also understand the point of view of people who disagree with me, and I think their best point answers your first question: Why tax the rich, when the top 1% earn 22% of income but make up 42% of our tax revenue ?\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s not really a bad thing that we tax richer people more, because the same idea behind the Laffer Curve for the government is also at play for individuals \u2014 every extra dollar you earn past a certain point gives diminishing returns, so it\u2019s better to put a higher tax on the dollars people need less. Second, despite income inequality going down in 2023, it\u2019s still extremely high in historical terms, and a more progressive tax is a pretty good tool for addressing it.\n\nFrom my point of view, the big question is how to effectively tax the ultra-wealthy, who amass their fortunes not from salaries but from stock benefits and investments. Those are hard to tax , and they should be. But in a country where the 400 richest people own as much wealth as the bottom 60% combined, and where their fortunes are almost unimaginable , you\u2019re going to see a lot of popular interest in progressively taxing the people who earn significantly more in a year than most people will ever see in a lifetime.\n\nWant to have a question answered in the newsletter?

            "text": "The biggest donor in this U.S. election cycle is Jeffrey Yass, a libertarian hedge fund owner who started off as a professional poker player and is now a major investor in TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance.\n\nPhiladelphia-based Yass has donated more than $46 million to Republican causes so far in the 2024 election cycle, data from political donations tracker OpenSecrets shows.\n\nThe funds have gone to support former rivals of Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, as well as a raft of groups supporting school choice, programs that use taxpayer dollars to send students to private and religious schools.\n\nYass, 65, was thrust into the spotlight this month after Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, reversed course on his preference for banning TikTok, saying a ban would hurt some children and only strengthen Meta Platforms' Facebook.\n\nTrump made the comments days after he met Yass at a gathering of the conservative Club for Growth donor group in Florida.\n\nThe U-turn on TikTok amid a major cash crunch led to speculation that Trump might be trying to court Yass.\n\nTrump says the pair only met for \"a few minutes,\" and did not discuss TikTok but instead talked about education.\n\nTrump has been significantly outraised on funding by Democrat President Joe Biden and faces hostility from many traditional Republican donors, all while scrambling for money to pay off around a half-billion dollars in legal judgments.\n\nYass, who leads Pennsylvania-based global hedge fund Susquehanna International Group and whose net worth Forbes puts at around $27 billion, has not donated to Trump.\n\nHe did, however, give money to support four of Trump's former opponents for the Republican presidential nomination: Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a major Trump critic.\n\nYass has not previously donated to Trump. A spokesperson for Yass declined to comment for this article.\n\nYass' political contributions have soared from the levels he spent in previous elections, OpenSecrets data shows. In the entire 2016 election cycle, for example, Yass and his wife donated just over $5 million \u2013 a ninth of his donations in the current cycle, which wraps up with the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nHis donations this cycle have included some $16 million to the Club for Growth Action, a super PAC funding group linked to the fiscally conservative Club for Growth non-profit. The Club for Growth is also against the TikTok ban.\n\nTo be sure, Yass and the Club for Growth have over the years also donated to many members of Congress who support banning TikTok, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nPoker, Trading, and Schools\n\nThe son of two accountants and a math major himself, Yass went to Las Vegas after college and played poker professionally, Yass says in a video posted by Susquehanna on YouTube. He later moved to Philadelphia and worked as an options trader on the floor in 1981.\n\nA passion for betting and probability seems to permeate much of what he does.\n\n\"Sometimes I find myself at a race track literally trying to make $2 on an idea that I have,\" Yass, bespectacled and sitting in front of what appears to be a row of traders at their computers, said in the Susquehanna video.\n\nIn the political sphere, Yass is laser-focused on the issue of school choice programs, according to interviews with politicians who know him and fellow donors.\n\n\"He is truly a libertarian. His main interest is promoting school choice. That's what motivates Jeff,\" said Frayda Levin, a Republican donor who knows Yass and sees him at events at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nLibertarians typically support maximizing individual rights and minimizing the role of government.\n\nIn addition to having poured millions into supporting school choice on a political level, Yass and his wife Janine Yass, with whom he has four children, award monetary prizes to education providers.\n\nSchool choice programs have gained wide appeal in recent years as some parents have become disgruntled with the state of U.S. public education, for reasons ranging from underfunding to concerns about what is taught in classrooms.\n\nHowever, some Democrats view the push to use state funds for private and religious schools with suspicion, saying they are attempts by Republicans to weaken public education while further enriching wealthy families.",

However, the report only covers a part of the committees associated with those running for office.\n\nWATCH | US Elections 2024: Nikki Haley backer Harry Sloan to donate to Biden Biden at the end of February, had $71 million in cash available in his main campaign account which is more than double of Trump\u2019s $33.5 million.\n\nThe filings show that the former president received more than $3 million in his campaign account in February, which added to the $30 million on hand in January.\n\nHowever, the incumbent president, which had $56 million by the end of January, added $15 million in February.\n\nWhile Trump is in the lead in more nationwide polls, Biden and the Democratic Party have a growing cash advantage.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, according to the filing, had more than twice the cash on hand when compared to its Republican counterpart.\n\nHowever, the report does not show the entire picture since Biden and Trump are raising money through joint fundraising committees which will not file their reports until the end of next month.\n\nA Trump campaign official told CNN that their campaign and joint fundraising committee brought in $20.3 million in February and they entered this month with a combined $41.9 million cash.\n\nThe amount still trails behind Biden\u2019s campaign which reported raising a combined $53 million in February across the committees supporting his re-election bid, with a combined total of a whopping $155 million.\n\nReasons behind the cash gap\n\nBiden, as the current president, reportedly has an advantage over Trump, who became the presumptive Republican nominee only in February.\n\nThe cash crunch has also reportedly prompted the former president to have meetings at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and even host private dinners with the Republican Party\u2019s biggest financiers.\n\nThe former president\u2019s lagging in terms of cash could also be attributed to his many legal woes as the filings also show the financial strain it is taking on his campaign. Trump is currently facing four criminal trials.\n\nAlso Read | Trump Tower among properties that could be seized to cover $454mn civil fraud fine\n\nThe financial disclosures of the group called Save America \u2013 which raises money together with Trump\u2019s election campaign but is legally separate and reportedly used to underwrite his lawyers\u2019 fees \u2013 showed that around $5.6 million was spent on legal bills in February.\n\nThe amount spent was the biggest single month of spending on legal bills since Trump formed the organisation in 2020 after his election defeat four years ago.\n\nThe filings also show that the group has spent more than $55 million on legal bills since the beginning of last year.",

But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time, and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the crisis.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, 'Are you better off today than you were yesterday?' Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday.\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and his allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt cited higher mortgage rates, illegal border crossings, the war in Ukraine and other foreign conflicts to argue the U.S. was better off under Trump prior to Covid-19.\n\n\u201cAmericans know Biden has been a disaster and they were far better off under President Trump, which is why President Trump continues to crush Biden in the polls,\u201d Leavitt said.",

            "text": "The House impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden has hit a crossroads, lacking the political appetite from within Republican ranks to go forward with an actual impeachment, but facing political pressure to deliver after months of work.\n\nThe Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, James Comer, has signaled an interest in another direction. He is stopping short of drawing up articles of impeachment against the president, but eying criminal referrals of Biden family wrongdoing to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.\n\nWith the panel\u2019s star witness, Hunter Biden, not expected to appear for Wednesday\u2019s public hearing after having testified privately last month, Comer telegraphed what was coming next.\u201dIf he does not show up, then it\u2019s not going to end well for the Bidens,\u201d Comer said over the weekend on Fox News. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be multiple criminal referrals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the start of a potential wind-down for the lengthy GOP-led probe that was launched after Republicans seized control of the House in January, eager to hold Biden to the high bar of impeachment that twice reprimanded Donald Trump during his presidency.\n\nAs Trump and Biden face another likely rematch this November, Comer is weighing whether to keep the impeachment inquiry going through Hunter Biden\u2019s often complicated business dealings and his storied, but troubled life, or wrap up work even if that falls short of a historic presidential impeachment.\n\nThe White House has called the inquiry a \u201ccharade\u201d and told Republicans to \u201cmove on.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s hearing will delve deeper into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings as Republicans seek testimony from Jason Galanis, who is serving a lengthy federal prison sentence in Alabama for fraud schemes and is expected to appear remotely, and Tony Bobulinski, a one-time business associate of Hunter Biden who took his claims against the family public during the first Trump-Biden presidential debate in 2020.\n\nThe Democrats have called witness Lev Parnas to testify, relying on the convicted businessman who was central to Trump\u2019s first impeachment as a Rudy Giuliani associate working to dig up political dirt on Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. Parnas has since played a key role in dispelling the House GOP\u2019s main claim of bribery against the Bidens as simply not true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho better than Lev Parnas himself \u2014 Rudy Giuliani\u2019s right-hand man on the original mission to smear Joe Biden \u2014 to tell the story of how this campaign of lies and slander works?\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, in a statement.\n\nRaskin said Parnas can \u201cdebunk the bogus claims at the heart of the impeachment probe and, in the process, explain how the GOP ended up in this degraded and embarrassing place.\u201d\n\nSo far, the impeachment inquiry\u2019s public hearings have often devolved into all-day spectacles as scores of lawmakers take their turn grilling the witnesses.\n\nHunter Biden, who is facing firearm and tax charges in separate matters, testified behind closed doors last month in a committee deposition that filled more than 200 pages but left Comer\u2019s panel without the hard evidence it was seeking of wrongdoing by the president or his son.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe committee asserts that the Bidens traded on the family name, an influence-peddling scheme that seeks to link a handful of phone calls or dinner or lunch meetings between Joe Biden, when he was vice president, and Hunter Biden and his business associates.\n\nBut their slim majority narrowed by early retirements, House Republicans may not have enough support within their ranks to pursue articles of impeachment against President Biden, especially since Democrats would likely vote against any such charges.\n\nInstead, Comer has been looking into potential criminal referrals to the Justice Department, which would likely be symbolic, but could open the door to prosecutions in a future administration. It\u2019s unclear who would exactly be charged, and over what offenses, and Comer has also discussed drafting ethics-related legislation to tighten influence peddling or foreign lobbying among officials.\n\nRead more | Hunter Biden indicted on nine tax charges, adding to gun charges in special counsel probe\n\nA House committee spokesperson said that the impeachment inquiry is ongoing without a predetermined outcome. The committee will issue a final report with its recommendations once the inquiry has concluded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGalanis, who was initially interviewed by the committee last month from prison, has told the panel that he expected to make \u201cbillions\u201d with Hunter Biden and other associates, using the Biden family name in their foreign business dealings.\n\nHe has told the panel of a particular time when Hunter Biden put his dad on speakerphone for a brief minute-long chat during a birthday party at a New York restaurant for the 1-year-old child with potential foreign business partners. He acknowledged that he unsuccessfully sought a pardon in the final days of the Trump presidency.\n\nHunter Biden, in his own deposition to the panel, said he met Galanis for about 30 minutes 10 years ago.\n\nBobulinski who has gone public with his allegations has told the panel in his interview that he met briefly with Joe Biden when he was vice president through Hunter Biden. The Democratic witness, Parnas, had been a central figure in Trump\u2019s first impeachment over withholding aid to Ukraine. He helped Giuliani with the false claims that Joe Biden, as vice president, had intervened in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor as a favor to Hunter Biden\u2019s work on the board of the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWestern allies also wanted the prosecutor fired over allegations of corruption.\n\nLast summer, Senate Republicans released unverified claims from an FBI informant who disclosed more such details, including allegations of payments to the Bidens that became central to the House GOP probe. At the time, Parnas sent Comer a lengthy later dispelling those claims, saying it was all talk and the money was not paid to the Bidens.\n\nThe now former FBI informant Alexander Smirnov was arrested last month and pleaded not guilty to charges that he fabricated the bribery allegations.",

More recently, in November, she joined other former first ladies at Rosalynn Carter\u2019s tribute service.

Her youth anti-cyberbullying initiative, \u201cBe Best,\u201d was poorly received, as were her controversial renovations of the White House. In 2018 she was also roundly criticized for wearing a jacket that said \u201cI Really Don\u2019t Care. Do U?\u201d while visiting a detention center for migrant children \u2014 a message she later claimed was meant for the media.\n\nDespite her apparent discomfort in the high-profile role, Melania Trump has said that she supports her husband\u2019s 2024 re-election bid, telling Fox News last year that they \u201clook forward to restoring hope for the future and leading America with love and strength.\u201d\n\nHer remarks stand in stark contrast to the tone of the campaign that her husband has embraced. As the 2024 election ramps up in earnest, Donald Trump has stepped up his violent anti-immigrant rhetoric, vowed to lock up his political enemies, and warned that U.S. democracy will end if he loses the election again.",

            "text": "Biden, Lenin, And Immigration Language: Gingrich\n\nAuthored by Newt Gingrich via RealClear Wire,\n\nAs an historian, it has been fascinating to watch the left try to impose new language to describe people in the country illegally.\n\nThe left has gradually pushed accepted language away from \u201cillegal aliens\u201d (the term in law), to \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d (the most common term), to \u201cundocumented immigrants\u201d (the left\u2019s current favorite term), and now to \u201cnewcomers\u201d (the Joe Biden White House\u2019s latest experiment in gaining language dominance).\n\nIt all reminds me of Vladimir Lenin\u2019s great language coup of 1903.\n\nThe Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party met secretly in Brussels. (The Czar\u2019s secret police made it impossible to meet openly in Russia). At the meeting there was a split between Lenin\u2019s hardline revolutionary faction and a more moderate democratic wing. Lenin\u2019s faction was the smaller group, but they claimed the title Bolshevik (which means \u201cgreater faction\u201d or majority). Group with the most votes were foolish enough to accept the title Lenin gave them, which was Menshevik, meaning minority. That language dominance and branding gave Lenin an enormous advantage in the following two-decade struggle to overthrow the Czar and create Soviet Russia.\n\nAt least as far back as the French Revolution, the left has had a passion for labeling things and ideas to gain language dominance.\n\nThis process as applied to illegal immigration began at least 25 years ago for me. That\u2019s when I first remember being lectured that using the term \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d was wrong, and I should learn to say \u201cundocumented.\u201d\n\nI thought this was nuts then, and I still do now. By definition, the people we were describing are illegal. Their first act on entering the United States is to break the law. Their decision to do so is an insult to every legal immigrant who patiently followed the rules and entered the United States legally.\n\nIn late February, the Biden White House had a handout which said, \u201cThe bill also includes $1.4 billion for cities and states who are providing critical services to newcomers.\u201d The reaction to replacing \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d with \u201cnewcomer\u201d was so harsh that the Biden team dropped it. But their goal was clear.\n\nThis process of normalizing weird and radical ideas goes on constantly on the left. Think of pushing transgenderism on children, kneeling during the pledge of allegiance, ignoring the destruction caused by the Black Lives Matter riots, etc.\n\nThe problem for the left is that illegal immigration may be the battlefield on which they can\u2019t win.\n\nThe latest absurdity began when Biden responded to jeers from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene during his State of the Union Address. He said, \u201cLincoln (sic) Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal. That\u2019s right. But how many of thousands of people are being killed by legals?\u201d\n\nNote that even in acknowledging a young woman who was killed by an illegal immigrant, Biden had to immediately cover it with thousands being killed by legal immigrants and citizens. The illegal immigrant could not be the focus.\n\nOf course, he got Riley\u2019s name wrong, but the left immediately attacked him for using the term \u201cillegal.\u201d This includes former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Biden promptly began trying to backtrack. In an interview with MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart on Saturday, Biden acknowledged his sin of language, \"I shouldn't have used \u2018illegal,\u2019 it's \u2018undocumented.\u2019\"\n\nBut Biden couldn\u2019t stop there. He had to be pro-illegal immigrant. \u201cI\u2019m not going to treat any, any, any of these people with disrespect. Look, they built the country. The reason our economy is growing,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden\u2019s defense of illegal immigration hurt him with the average American \u2013 and his use of \u201cillegal\u201d hurt him with his leftwing allies.\n\nHis confusion made him look weak. So, in another act of language dominance, the White House simply decided he really never apologized for saying \u201cillegal\u201d in the first place.\n\nAs The Hill reported:\n\n\u201cWhite House deputy spokesperson Olivia Dalton attempted to clarify on Monday, telling a reporter that \u2018the president absolutely did not apologize\u2019 despite his expression of regret.\n\n\u201c\u2018There was no apology anywhere in that conversation,\u2019\u201d Dalton told reporters on Air Force One. \u2018He did not apologize. He used a different word. I think what we should be really clear about is the facts.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiden (and his press team) may be confused, but the American people are not. As Scott Rasmussen reported:\n\n\u201cOur recent polling found that 55% of voters believe \u2018illegal immigrant\u2019 is the proper term and another 8% prefer \u2018illegal alien.\u2019 While 63% favor use of \u2018illegal,\u2019 just 24% prefer \u2018undocumented migrant.\u2019\n\n\u201cAmong traditional Democrats, 54% prefer \u2018illegal\u2019 and 33% \u2018undocumented.\u2019 But [Bernie] Sanders Democrats prefer \u2018undocumented\u2019 by a 48% to 30% margin. It is the progressive Democrats who forced Biden to apologize. This just moves him even further from the mainstream.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Laken Riley was reportedly killed by an illegal immigrant. That illegal immigrant was in Athens, Ga. because of Biden\u2019s insane policies which favor an open border and prioritize illegal immigrants over American citizens.\n\nNo word games can overcome those facts.\n\nFor more commentary from Newt Gingrich, visit Gingrich360.com.

            "text": "by Nie Shangyou\n\nHOUSTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- At the top-level global energy forum CERAWeek that kicked off here on Monday, oil giants across the Atlantic are fine-tuning their investment strategies in view of multiple challenges arising from geopolitical tensions, climate change and rapid growth of renewable energy.\n\nInvestment opportunities created by favorable government policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed by the Biden administration, have also led to directional change in capital investment, local analysts said.\n\nTotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the forum that the French oil major previously regarded the United States as an unfavorable investment location but is now investing heavily in gas, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and power projects in Texas.\n\n\"We appointed a new country chair to coordinate TotalEnergies' growing investment in the United States,\" he said.\n\nTotalEnergies, with a significant amount of investment in Russia, is also trying to diversify into other regions, including Brazil and Suriname in South America and Namibia in Africa, the top executive said.\n\nExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods said on Monday that the U.S. oil giant has decided to invest in a major way in carbon capture and sequestration as the view on climate change is \"evolving.\"\n\nHistorically, ExxonMobil and other oil companies used CO2 capture technology for enhanced oil recovery. This time around, its CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and storage) project along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico is for CO2 capture and sequestration including those from third parties, he noted.\n\nWoods admitted that IRA financial incentives are enabling CCUS projects to be economically viable, but said: \"I am not a big fan of government subsidies\" as they tend not to be sustainable in the long run.\n\nExxonMobil has also started to look into extracting lithium from brine, as its technical team has found a potentially economically viable level of lithium in the produced water in its operations, Woods said. He also claimed that ExxonMobil's operations in the Permian Basin are \"well on its way to achieving net-zero emissions by 2030.\"\n\nShell CEO Wael Sawan said the British energy giant is trying to further play its role in gas and global LNG, as Europe is reducing its dependence on Russian pipeline gas.\n\nShell is trying to \"stabilize oil production\" and streamlining its investment in renewable energy, Sawan added, stressing the firm's strength in energy integration as an efficient producer of renewable energy.\n\nCERAWeek, known as the Super Bowl in the global energy industry, draws over 9,000 government, industry and academic leaders from more than 80 countries and regions this year, according to the organizer S&P Global. It will run till Friday. \u25a0\n\nEditor: \u987e\u601d\u57df",

Trump defended Moreno and claimed \u201cDemocratic fake treatment\u201d for the story Moreno\u2019s campaign had confirmed: \u201cWe all know this man. He\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s a winner and we\u2019re not going to let these people \u2014 these people are sick.\u201d\n\n03.16.2024 Appeared at a campaign rally for Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, sponsored by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC. The PAC released an ad targeting a Moreno rival as \u201ca champion for trans equality.\u201d The PAC also reportedly sent campaign mail asking \u201cWhat Team Does Frank LaRose Play For?\u201d and \u201cIs he with us \u2026 Or is he with they/them?\u201d\n\n03.04.2024 Endorsed North Carolina Lt. Governor Mark Robinson for governor, despite Robinson\u2019s history of anti-LGBTQ disinformation and rhetoric, including calling gay people \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201cmaggots.\u201d Trump repeated his past claims that Robinson is \u201cbetter than Martin Luther King\u201d and \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids.\u201d\n\n02.02.2024 Used vulgar slang to refer to LGBTQ legal icon Roberta Kaplan, who represented E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Trump was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her by mocking her claims after he left the White House. A jury awarded Carroll with $83 million in damages. Kaplan recalled leading the deposition of Trump, saying that at the end Trump\u2019s lawyers asked to go \u201coff the record,\u201d meaning what he said would not be included on the court deposition transcript. Kaplan said Trump then said to her: \u201cSee you next Tuesday,\u201d a slang term referring to a word for female genitalia used as an insult for women.\n\n02.20.2024 Supported by the anti-LGBTQ national organization Heritage Foundation with a 180-page document detailing regulations and executive orders to be taken in first days in office, including: \u201cdeleting [from federal agencies and federal rule] the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\u201cSOGI\u201d), diversity, equity, and inclusion., gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights;\u201d limiting abortion access with executive orders using the Comstock Act \u2014 a long-inactive 19th century law that banned birth control and abortion medication by mail. Semafor reported: While Project 2025 bills itself as being \u201ccandidate agnostic,\u201d [project director Paul] Dans noted that at this point in the primary, they expect \u201cand hope\u201d that Donald Trump will ultimately end up in office again. NBC News reported that Project 2025 includes representatives from anti-LGBTQ, anti-equality and anti-democracy groups \u201cled by veterans of the Trump administration, such as America First Legal, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute, the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\u201d (Links to groups added by GLAAD).\n\n01.10.2024 Boasted of his role in the Supreme Court decision ending the right to abortion by nominating three of the justices who joined the decision: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, with Roe v. Wade, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about this stuff. For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it and I\u2019m proud to have done it,\u201d Trump said. Abortion is an LGBTQ issue: LGBTQ people can and do get pregnant, lesbian young women are two to ten times more likely to become pregnant than heterosexual youth, lesbian and bisexual women are often at higher risk of sexual assault due in part to their sexual orientation, which may also result in an unplanned pregnancy.\n\n12.30.2023 Criticized Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing state bill banning essential health care for transgender youth and banning trans youth from school sports, spread disinformation about the care and school sports. DeWine had said his veto was based on conversations he had with parents, patients and providers who told him how the care saves lives. Trump said in a Truth Social post: \u201cDeWine has fallen to the Radical Left\u2026 What was he thinking. The bill would have stopped child mutilation, and prevented men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Legislature will hopefully overturn. Do it FAST!!!\u201d Ohio hospitals and providers, along with hundreds of others, had testified that they do not perform surgeries on youth, and Ohio\u2019s school sports association has long had policies to ensure inclusive participation of transgender students.\n\n12.17.2023 Announced on social media, \u201cOn Day One [of a second term if he were reelected President], I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children\u2026\u201d\n\n11.03.2023 Mimicked a Canadian weightlifter in an extended campaign event skit to mock and misgender transgender women in sports, claiming he will \u201cend this on day one\u201d if he\u2019s re-elected.\n\n05.17.2023 Proudly stated, \u201cI was able to kill Roe v. Wade,\u201d taking credit for the Supreme Court overturning the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision. The Dobbs decision suggested that the right to same-sex marriage should be reconsidered by the Court as well.\n\n06.11.2023 Said of transgender athletes at a rally, \u201cWho would even think that you can allow this? Who would say that this is okay? These people are sick. They are deranged\u2026. It\u2019s astonishing how passionately people react to that. When you talk about tax cuts, they remain calm. But when you mention transgender issues, everyone goes wild. Who would have imagined five years ago that they wouldn\u2019t even know what \u2018it\u2019 meant?\u201d\n\n04.14.2023 Said that if re-elected, he would use the government to investigate and potentially halt transgender health care during a National Rifle Association (NRA) speech. \u201cUpon my inauguration, I will direct the FDA to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression and even violence,\u201d said Trump. He also accused Democrats of \u201cpushing the transgender cult\u201d on children.\n\n03.26.2023 Vowed to crack down on \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d and pledged to \u201crevoke every Biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth\u201d at the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign. He said that he would \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports\u201d if re-elected president, after he last year misgendered transgender athlete Lia Thomas. He added: \u201cI will immediately sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d\n\n01.31.2023 Made multiple false claims about gender affirming care, tweeting a so-called \u201cPlan to Protect Children from Left-Wing Gender Insanity.\u201c Every major medical association and world health authority supports gender affirming care; statements here including from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cThere is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving. The decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.\u201d\n\n01.29.2023 At a campaign event, falsely claimed and without evidence or fact: \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the left-wing radical racists and perverts who are trying to indoctrinate our youth, and we\u2019re going to get their Marxist hands off our children\u2026We\u2019re going to defeat the cult of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders: men and women. We\u2019re not going to allow men to play women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\n01.26.2023 Released so-called education policy that cuts federal funding for any school or program that includes \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.\u201d\n\n11.15.2022 In speech announcing third run for president, baselessly targeted schools for \u201cradical civics and gender insanity\u201d (without defining what those are) and stated inaccurate and inflammatory promises such as \u201cWe will not let men, as an example, participate in women\u2019s sports.\u201d Recommitted to his 2017 tweeted ban against transgender Americans serving in the military: \u201cAs commander-in-chief, I will get Biden\u2019s radical left ideology out of our military.\u201d President Biden reversed the tweeted order in 2021 in one of his first acts as President. 70% of Americans support allowing transgender Americans to serve in the U.S. armed forces. 66% of active-duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines support serving alongside transgender personnel.\n\n08.06.22 Invited activist Riley Gaines on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) as he baselessly claimed that \u201cleft-wing lunatics\u201d encourage unfair competition in sports. Gaines has profited by spreading disinformation about transgender people and athletes after tying for 5th place with a transgender swimmer at the NCAA championships. Gaines went on to endorse Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president over Trump.\n\n03.01.22 Told a gay supporter they did not \u201clook gay\u201d during a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gays for Trump?\u201d Trump asked a crowd of supporters at the event which was raising funds for congressional candidate John Gibbs. Someone replied, \u201cWe\u2019re over here.\u201d Trump pointed at them and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look gay,\u201d which elicited laughs from the audience.\n\n02.24.22 Praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying at a Florida fundraiser, he is \u201cpretty smart\u2026 He\u2019s taken over a country for $2 worth of sanctions\u2026 taking over a country\u2014really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people\u2014and just walking right in.\u201d In fact the sanctions include: freezing the global banking assets of Putin, various government officials, and some oligarchs; immobilizing the assets of the Russian Central Bank and cutting off Russian banks from business with the U.S.; removing Russia from SWIFT which handles about 70% of Russian banking transactions; barring any new oil and gas deals with Russia; and other sanctions. The effect has been to shrink the Russian economy 35% in the second quarter of 2022 and 7% for the entire year. Despite being outsized and out resourced, Ukraine has stymied or slowed much of the Russian invasion effort. The autocrat Trump praised as \u201cpretty smart,\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin, signed legislation on 2013 to ban the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relations to minors,\u201d which, writes Human Rights Watch, is \u201ca reference universally understood to mean a ban on providing children access to information about LGBT people\u2019s lives\u2026 The law has been used to shut down websites that provide valuable information and services to teens across Russia and to bar LGBT support groups from working with youth. But the law\u2019s effects have been much broader: Individual mental health professionals have curtailed what they say and what support they give to students, and the law gives the strong imprimatur of the Russian state to the false and discriminatory view that LGBT people are a threat to tradition and the family\u2026 Its passage coincided with an uptick in often-gruesome vigilante violence against LGBT people in Russia\u2014frequently carried out in the name of protecting Russian values and Russia\u2019s children.\u201d Putin signed legislation in 2021 to constitutionally ban same-sex marriage in Russia.\n\n02.28.21 Told a crowd of supporters that he did not believe transgender women and girls should compete on sports teams consistent with their gender identity, referring to trans female athletes as \u201cbiological males,\u201d a term often used by anti-trans activists to suggest transgender people are not who they say they are.\n\nPresidency\n\n01.08.21 The day after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a deadly rampage, HHS went public with a final rule to rescind regulations barring discrimination against LGBTQ Americans seeking to adopt or be adopted, or health services including HIV prevention.\n\n12.07.20 Labor Department, led by Secretary Eugene Scalia, announces rule-change implementation to allow federal contractors to discriminate against LGBTQ workers via religious exemption. The rule change takes effect Jan. 8, with 12 days remaining in the Trump administration, and will require a full rule-change process for the new administration to revise.\n\n10.24.20 Report shows U.S. State Department has been omitting information about human rights abuses against LGBTQ and intersex people, as well as information about violence against women and girls. The Asylum Research Center report from the UK says there\u2019s concern the omissions will result in the erasure of abuses used to make asylum claims and decisions, with LGBTQI+ people being returned to dangerous home countries.\n\n10.17.20 Department of Education pressures New Hampshire\u2019s Franklin Pierce University to drop its trans-inclusive policy in athletics. The university agreed to rescind its policy permitting transgender athletes to compete consistent with their gender identity to avoid an investigation by the DOE\u2019s Office of Civil Rights. A civil rights complaint triggering the threat of an investigation was filed by \u201cConcerned Women for America,\u201d a noted anti-LGBTQ hate group.\n\n10.17.20 Tiffany Trump appears at campaign event, falsely claims her father supports the LGBTQ community, ignoring his and his administration\u2019s record of hundreds of attacks against the community. She also omits the \u201cT\u201d when saying \u201cLGBTQ.\u201d The \u201cT\u201d stands for Transgender. LGBTQ advocates see Tiffany Trump\u2019s omission as another example of President Trump and his supporters failure to recognize and support trans people and their very existence.\n\n10.10.20 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, warned by his advance team that an event with the anti-gay Florida Family Policy Council had homophobic advertisements/flyers at the site and that the group promoted dangerous, debunked conversion therapy, appears at October 3 event anyway. State Dept. aides were reportedly appalled at the speaking event and that Pompeo touted it afterward, in a department-wide memo.\n\n10.05.20 On the first day of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u201ctake a legal baseball bat\u201d to the court\u2019s 2015 decision legalizing marriage equality, claiming the decision \u201cenables courts and governments to brand religious adherents who believe marriage equality is between one man and one woman as bigots.\u201d Justice Thomas writes that Kim Davis, the public official who had refused to issue marriage licenses based on her religious belief, is a \u201cvictim\u201d of a so-called \u201ccavalier treatment of religion.\u201d\n\n09.29.20 President Trump\u2019s son Eric claims that LGBTQ people \u201ccome out in full force\u201d to support his father. GLAAD releases a scientific poll of LGBTQ voters showing 76% support VP Joe Biden.\n\n09.26.20 Legal scholars conclude Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s resume could make her the most conservative new justice since Clarence Thomas. On gun rights\u2014would probably strike down \u201cred flag\u201d laws to temporarily take firearms away from dangerous people. She has \u201cvoiced skepticism about the Affordable Care Act. A \u201cdream candidate\u201d for conservatives focused on overturning abortion rights.\n\n09.26.20 President Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. In her speech, Barrett says she adheres to the same judicial philosophy as the late justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia, who dissented in cases advancing LGBTQ rights, called the Obergefell decision \u201ca threat to American democracy,\u201d and Barrett has similarly stated views against marriage equality, defended dissenters of Obergefell, and delivered speeches paid for by anti-LGBTQ groups. She was vetted for the Trump administration by The Federalist Society, which has argued against every major LGBTQ policy proposal including extending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to include LGBTQ workers, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, hate crimes legislation, \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d and transgender accommodations. At least 11 people at the White House event announcing Barrett later test positive for COVID-19, including President Trump, his wife, former senior adviser, press secretary, the president of Notre Dame University, and two members of the Judiciary Committee who say they will quarantine for ten days, then attend Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearing.\n\n09.18.20 Within an hour of the announcement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announces \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\n09.18.20 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos vows to withhold federal funds from Connecticut school districts that participate in athletic conference allowing transgender athletes to compete consistent with their gender identity.The move to withhold about $18 million intended to help schools desegregate could have national implications for both transgender athletes and students of color.\n\n09.16.20 Trump administration deploys legal strategy to avoid enforcing The U.S. Supreme Court Bostock ruling extending protections for LGBTQ workers, pushing rules that allow shelters and schools to insist access be based only on gender assigned at birth.\n\n09.10.20 President Trump reveals additions to his list of potential Supreme Court appointees, which include Republican senators who have campaigned against marriage equality, a Trump-appointed federal judge with ties to an anti-LGBTQ organization identified as a hate group, and Trump\u2019s former Solicitor General who has filed briefs and argued before the Court to allow organizations to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Axios reports the list was partly motivated by the Court\u2019s ruling in June 2020 to expand LGBTQ protections in the workplace.\n\n09.08.20 The Trump administration files 36-page brief with Indiana Supreme Court to support a school\u2019s alleged right to fire a teacher for being gay.\n\n08.31.20 White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany falsely characterizes a State Department policy denying citizenship to children of same-sex couples born via surrogacy overseas. McEnany claimed the policy denied citizenship based solely on surrogacy when in fact only LGBTQ surrogacy families had been rejected. McEnany then read what she called the administration\u2019s LGBTQ \u201cachievements,\u201d a list she has previously read and which has been debunked as anti-LGBTQ.\n\n08.28.20 The Trump State Department says it\u2019s reviewing a federal judge\u2019s ruling with the Department of Justice, ordering State to issue a U.S. passport for the daughter of a married gay couple from Georgia and ruling her a citizen since birth. The judge had ruled the State Department policy requiring a biological connection raised serious constitutional questions for same-sex couples.\n\n08.24.20 The Washington Post gives Trump advisor Richard Grenell four Pinnochios for, \u201cThe absurd claim that Trump is the \u2018most pro-gay president in American history.\u2019\u201d The claims are deemed \u201cwhoppers,\u201d and every claim Grenell makes is discredited.\n\n08.21.20 The State Department is fighting a ruling to recognize citizenship of a young girl with gay parents. She was born in Canada via surrogate, and although her parents are legally married and U.S. citizens, the State Dept. argued in federal court she was \u201cborn out of wedlock\u201d and therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship. A judge deemed the controversial State policy unconstitutional in June.\n\n08.20.20 The lead U.S. foreign aid agency proposes a new policy on gender and women\u2019s empowerment that eliminates any mention of transgender people or contraceptives, running counter to its own long-standing practices in deciding what programs to support. The draft policy released by the U.S. Agency for International Development doesn\u2019t use the acronym LGBT or the words \u201clesbian,\u201d \u201cgay,\u201d \u201cbisexual,\u201d \u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201cidentity\u201d at all. Gender experts and advocates said the new policy falls far short of providing the expertise the agency needs to address gender issues in development.\n\n08.19.20 The Department of Health and Human Services has been systematically discriminating against LGBTQ+ families in federally supported foster care programs, according to a new report from the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee. The committee found that federally-funded agencies were granted a waiver to allow discrimination based on religion and sexual orientation, intentionally harming LGBTQ children, adults, and families.\n\n08.10.20 Jenna Ellis, Trump campaign senior legal adviser and the president\u2019s personal lawyer misgenders Pennsylvania\u2019s Health Secretary. Ellis, who has no apparent medical degree, uses Twitter to mock other efforts to control the pandemic that has killed 163,000 people on President Trump\u2019s watch. Ellis also condemns same-sex marriage and transgender identity, and has tweeted to promote conversion therapy.\n\n07.29.20 Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos visit a private school in Raleigh, NC, lauding its reopening for in-person education despite the coronavirus epidemic. Thales Academy founder Bob Luddy is one of the biggest Republican donors in North Carolina. Luddy also founded Franklin Academy, a Wake Forest charter school that changed its school handbook after criticism of rules prohibiting LGBT discussion or affirmation. Students protested Pence\u2019s visit with signs promoting LGBT rights and remote schooling. Within a week of Pence and DeVos\u2019 visit, students at a nearby sister school had to quarantine after a student tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n07.28.20 Three years after President Trump tweeted out a ban on transgender people in the military \u201cin any capacity,\u201d the White House says he\u2019s sticking with the policy. Each of the military service chiefs testified before Congress in 2018 they had seen no evidence of transgender service disrupting unit cohesion during the period of open service and a Dept. of Defense poll found about two-thirds of active-duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines support serving alongside transgender personnel.\n\n07.28.20 The Trump Administration plans to limit work permits for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from two years to one year. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in June that the administration could not carry out its plans to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program because it did not provide legal justification for terminating it. Of the 640,000 \u201cDreamers,\u201d 81,000 identify as LGBT and 39,000 have participated in DACA.\n\n07.27.20 After his administration supported the losing side at the Supreme Court on LGBTQ job protections, President Trump promises to choose from a new list of conservative jurists in his next court appointments. One potential candidate is Kyle Duncan, appointed by President Trump to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Duncan\u2019s anti-LGBT record includes arguing against trans student Gavin Grimm\u2019s request to use the restroom consistent with his gender identity and arguing against national marriage equality and calling the Supreme Court ruling in favor of it an \u201cabject failure\u201d that \u201cimperils civic peace.\u201d\n\n07.27.20 President Trump\u2019s niece, Mary Trump, says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d that her uncle believes he has support in the LGBTQ community, that he\u2019s uncomfortable with gay people and trans people, because \u201che\u2019s uncomfortable with anyone that\u2019s different\u2026 differently-abled, different color of skin, and different beliefs\u2026 He\u2019s not [an] ally of the gay community, or really any community for that matter. Donald doesn\u2019t have any concern or beliefs beyond his own self-interest.\u201d\n\n07.23.20 Trump administration revokes HUD regulation designed to eliminate racial disparities in the suburbs. Housing advocates say Trump\u2019s claims about the rule are inaccurate and racist. Only 30% of Black LGBT Americans own a home compared to 64.3% of the overall population.\n\n07.23.20 Former leader of now-defunct conversion therapy ministry, Exodus International, reveals previous lobbying work he did with members of the Trump administration. Randy Thomas has since denounced conversion therapy and announced his engagement to Dan Scobey. \u201cGiven my experience,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cI believe Mike Pence is still supportive of ex-gay ministry and he supports the efforts to try to convert people from gay to straight.\u201d Thomas also references working with Kellyanne Conway and other former Republican leaders, lobbying against marriage equality and hate crime legislation.\n\n07.22.20 Jenna Ellis, senior legal advisor to Donald Trump, retweets an article that promotes conversion therapy. Psychologists worldwide confirm LGBTQ people cannot change their gender identity or sexual orientation through conversion therapy. The American Psychiatric Association condemns such treatment and describes any attempts to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation as unethical. Ellis has a long record of racist and homophobic rhetoric, including criticizing her own Republican party for any attempt to embrace LGBTQ rights after the Pulse massacre killed 49 people, many of whom were LGBTQ.\n\n07.17.20 Defense Department confirms that new guidance to prohibit the display of Confederate flags on military institutions also includes bans on LGBTQ Pride flags. The Modern Military Association of America says the Pentagon is twisting the Confederate flag ban to achieve an anti-LGBTQ goal.\n\n07.17.20 New details emerge from proposed Housing and Urban Development rule limiting access for transgender people in single-sex homeless shelters. According to text from a leaked document obtained by Vox, the rule would allow federally-funded shelters to judge a person\u2019s physical characteristics, such as height and facial hair, in determining access to the shelter. Factors to be considered include \u201cthe presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam\u2019s apple, and other physical characteristics which, when considered together, are indicative of a person\u2019s biological sex.\u201d\n\n07.17.20 The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upholds lower court ruling blocking Trump administration from implementing new restrictions on people seeking asylum in the U.S. The proposal would eliminate gender-based asylum, despite dire consequences for women and girls seeking protection from extreme abuse and could result in judges rejecting similar claims based on gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\n07.16.20 U.S. Supreme Court allows policy banning voting rights to 1.4 million potential voters in Florida. Florida governor and Trump supporter Ron DeSantis and Republicans in the state legislature voted to require ex-felons pay court fines and fees before being allowed to vote, despite an amendment passed by Florida voters in 2018 restoring their right to vote. In May, a U.S. district judge ruled that the policy amounted to an unconstitutional voting tax. LGBTQ people are disproportionately incarcerated, especially young LGBTQ people and LGBTQ people of color, because they face housing, police and job discrimination.\n\n07.16.20 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo headlines a report from a pseudo-advisory group he appointed, criticizing efforts for racial justice and prioritizing religious freedom and property rights above all other human rights concerns. The so-called Commission on Unalienable Rights report refers to abortion, affirmative action, and same-sex marriage as \u201cdivisive social and political controversies in the United States\u201d rather than legally determined and settled rights. Pompeo delivered his speech before a large indoor crowd, despite urgent restrictions against such gatherings because of their documented increased risk of spreading the coronavirus.\n\n07.15.20 Former football coach Tommy Tuberville defeats Trump\u2019s former U.S. Attorney General and former Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions in the state\u2019s GOP primary runoff. Sessions\u2019 record on LGBTQ issues includes opposing all bills on LGBTQ equality throughout his decades in the U.S. Senate and continuing his assault on LGBTQ rights as Attorney General. Tuberville is a robust supporter of Trump, with a record of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric.\n\n07.13.20 Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany falsely claims President Trump has \u201ca great record\u201d with the LGBTQ community. Trump has an abysmal record of attacks on LGBTQ people, including implementing a ban on transgender people in the military, rolling back access to healthcare and homeless shelters, and defending discrimination in multiple cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n07.13.20 Trump ally and harsh opponent of LGBTQ rights Andrzej Duda wins second term as president of Poland. Duda governed and campaigned against LGBTQ rights, calling them an \u201cideology\u201d worse than Soviet-era communism. Duda\u2019s nationalist-conservative party rules the Polish Parliament with an aim to symbolically and literally erase queer Poles from social and political life, making Poland the least friendly country in the European Union to LGBTQ people. Trump and Duda have met 11 times, including at the White House in June, the first foreign leader to visit since the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States.\n\n07.10.20 Anti-LGBTQ+ groups tied to President Donald Trump received loans from the Small Business Administration as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. Several anti-LGBTQ organizations receiving money are designated hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center including Liberty Counsel, American Family Association, Pacific Justice Institute. Companies tied to Trump\u2019s adult children, son-in-law and millionaire friends also received money. At least $1.4 billion in taxpayer-backed funds went to the U.S. Roman Catholic Church, with millions going to dioceses that paid massive settlements or sought bankruptcy protection after covering up for pedophile priests. The Church used special exemptions granted by the Trump administration to circumvent limitations on aid imposed on every other organization.\n\n07.01.20 Housing and Urban Development announces new rule allowing single-sex homeless shelters to turn away transgender people, continuing a trend of dismantling protections for trans people across the federal government. HUD has acknowledged there is no evidence that transgender residents pose a risk to cisgender residents.\n\n06.22.20 In his first in-depth response to the landmark United States Supreme Court ruling protecting millions of Americans from being fired for being LGBT, President Trump says he was \u201csurprised\u201d by the decision, written by his first nominated justice Neil Gorsuch. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of losses with a court that was supposed to be in our favor,\u201d Trump said.\n\n06.19.20 Justice Department files \u201cstatement of interest\u201c supporting Idaho\u2019s new law barring transgender female athletes from competing consistent with their gender identity, a law that allows genital and genetic screenings. More than 500 college student-athletes and professional stars Megan Rapinoe, Billie Jean King, Jason Collins and Reggie Bullock, join a petition to the NCAA asking to move championships out of Idaho in response to the discriminatory law.\n\n06.14.20 Dept. of Housing and Urban Development considers rolling back a rule requiring homeless shelters to accommodate transgender people. Single-sex shelters may consider biological sex, instead of how a transgender person identifies, in placement and accommodation decisions. HUD acknowledges it has no data to show transgender women pose any kind of risk.\n\n06.12.20 Protections rolled back for transgender Americans seeking healthcare under new rule announced by HHS, four years to the day of the Pulse nightclub attack. Two dozen Democratic attorneys general have sued the Trump administration to block its rule ending protection against discrimination in health care for transgender patients. \u201cIt is never acceptable to deny health care to Americans who need it, but it is especially egregious to do so in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition.\n\n06.08.20 The Council for Global Equality calls out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for refusing to acknowledge LGBTQ Pride Month or the International Day against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia and Transphobia. Secretary Pompeo has promoted international policies used to deny LGBTI citizens equal rights in employment, health, and education.\n\n06.05.20 President Trump\u2019s Solicitor General files 35-page amicus brief to the Supreme Court to defend an agency\u2019s right to discriminate against same-sex couples looking to become foster parents. The agency actions violated Philadelphia\u2019s anti-discrimination ordinances.\n\n06.05.20 New Trump appointee to U.S. foreign aid agency USAID has history of online attacks against the \u201chomo-empire\u201d pushing \u201ctyrannical LGBT agenda.\u201d Merritt Corrigan formerly worked for the Republican National Committee and the Hungarian embassy in Washington. She has praised authoritarian Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. USAID says it has a \u201czero-tolerance policy of any form or harassment based on gender, race, sexual orientation, [and] religion\u201d and is working for a world in which LGBT people are \u201crespected and able to live with dignity, free from discrimination, persecution and violence.\u201d\n\n06.04.20 Support among evangelicals drops 15 points and falls 27 points among white Catholics. President Trump\u2019s handling of the protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police prompts rare rebuke from televangelist Pat Robertson.\n\n06.03.20 United States Solicitor General and 76 members of Congress (signed names here) file briefs at the Supreme Court to support discrimination against LGBTQ couples looking to become foster families.\n\n06.02.20 A day after clearing protestors with tear gas, flash bomb grenades and police in riot gear, President Trump signs executive order supporting \u201cinternational religious freedom.\u201d Stages another photo op in front of religious site. The Archbishop of Washington calls the visit \u201cbaffling and reprehensible.\u201d\n\n06.01.20 Thousands of protestors demanding justice for George Floyd and against racism and police brutality are cleared by coordinated militarized crackdown in the park in front of the White House. President Trump uses law enforcement officers from multiple agencies to secure his walk to St. John\u2019s Church to hold up a Bible, surrounded by five white advisers, for a campaign photo op. Religious leaders describe the actions as hypocritical and obscene.\n\n05.28.20 Trump administration threatens to withhold funding from states that allow athletes to compete under the gender with which they identify. In a 45-page letter, the Dept. of Education claims policies supporting transgender athletes violate Title IX, the federal civil rights law guaranteeing equal education opportunities for women. The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy follows a state law barring schools from discriminating against transgender students.\n\n05.19.20\u2014The Trump administration is using departments of State, Justice, Health and Human Services, Labor and Housing and Urban Development to push religious exemptions at the expense of LGBTQ rights, detailed by the ACLU, Center for American Progress and the Movement Advancement Project.\n\n05.15.20\u2014President Trump\u2019s new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany gives false answers about the administration\u2019s hurtful policies against LGBTQ Americans. McEnany deflected questions about her opposition in 2015 to same-sex marriage, saying arguments for marriage equality were driven by arguments based on \u201cfarcical blabber.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not up here to give my personal views on anything,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cWhat I\u2019d say is that I\u2019m very proud of this administration, which has been fair and equitable and just to all Americans, and open to all Americans as it should be.\u201d As of this date, GLAAD has counted more than 150 attacks against LGBTQ Americans from the Trump administration.\n\n05.15.20\u2014Newly-surfaced video and audio shows Trump campaign adviser and senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis grotesquely and falsely claim same-sex marriage will lead to legally and socially-accepted bestiality and pedophilia.\n\n05.15.20\u2014U.S. Navy grants waiver to transgender naval officer, allowing her to remain in uniform. It\u2019s the first waiver granted since the administration began enforcing its surprise ban against transgender service members. The government is expected to file its response to the suit filed by the naval officer in federal court.\n\n05.05.20\u2014HHS ruling targets LGBTQ youth during public health crisis. The Trump administration ends LGBTQ data collection on foster children and adoptive parents, silencing issues potentially faced by LGBTQ-identifying children in finding permanent homes. Christina Wilson Remlin, lead counsel for Children\u2019s Rights, calls it \u201ca huge mistake that will harm the children we serve.\u201d\n\n04.24.20\u2014The Trump administration moved to end a policy that protected LGBTQ patients from discrimination, potentially enabling hospitals and health workers to more easily discriminate against patients based on their gender or sexual orientation. This move alarmed health experts who warned that the regulatory rollback could harm vulnerable people during a pandemic.\n\n04.08.20\u2014President Trump appointed Kayleigh McEnany, who has a history of using the press to attack LGBTQ people, as Press Secretary.\n\n04.03.20\u2014The Trump Adminsitration\u2019s Department of Justice filed a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, which stated that it has a \u201csignificant interest\u201d in ensuring that Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 is interpreted as excluding transgender female athletes and applying only to cisgender females.\n\n03.25.20\u2014Preacher Ralph Drollinger, who leads a weekly Bible study for Cabinet Secretaries in the Trump Administration, wrote that he believes the coronavirus pandemic is a \u201cconsequential\u201d or \u201dsowing and reaping\u201d form of wrath that directly stems from tolerance of \u201da proclivity toward lesbianism and homosexuality.\u201d\n\n01.16.20\u2014A directive by the Trump Administration across multiple government agencies was issued to strengthen access to federal dollars for religious-based organizations\u2014even if the organization is anti-LGBTQ or has an anti-LGBTQ record.\n\n12.27.19\u2014A report in the HuffPost revealed the Trump Administration\u2019s erasure of pro-LGBTQ policies on Inauguration Day extended beyond government websites and throughout the entire federal government, including the Department of Interior.\n\n12.17.19\u2014The Trump Administration appoints notorious anti-LGBTQ activist Tim Wildmon to the White House\u2019s Faith Advisory Council.\n\n12.04.19\u2014In two straight years, the Trump Administration announced its plans to tighten regulations for food stamp access under the government\u2019s SNAP program, affecting about 755,000 Americans\u2014including the LGBTQ community.\n\n12.01.19\u2014For a third consecutive year, President Trump omits any mention of the LGBTQ community during his presidential proclamation recognizing December 1st as World AIDS Day.\n\n11.01.19\u2014The Trump Administration announced they are allowing taxpayer-funded adoption agencies to use \u201creligious beliefs\u201d as an excuse to deny placement of children into homes of LGBTQ couples\u2014simply for being LGBTQ.\n\n10.11.19\u2014The Trump Administration announced its support of allowing faith-based schools to use religion as a right to discriminate against LGBTQ teachers and staff and removing pro-LGBTQ curriculum in classrooms.\n\n10.01.19\u2014CNN reports that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) sent a letter to members of the Ames City Council asking the city to remove pro-LGBTQ themed crosswalks in the community, citing so-called \u201cfederal traffic control standards.\u201d\n\n09.27.19\u2014The Trump Administration pens a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d in support of granting the Archdiocese the ability to discriminate or even fire a person from their job because they are LGBTQ.\n\n09.20.19\u2014The Department of Education removes \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d as terms to track bullying data for the agency, inserting \u201csex stereotyping\u201d as a protected class instead. This eliminates any anti-LGBTQ bullying tracking data from the agency.\n\n09.19.19\u2014While touring San Francisco\u2019s HUD office, Secretary Ben Carson reportedly describes conversations about homeless women being traumatized if \u201cbig, hairy men\u201d walk into shelters identifying as women.

The request comes weeks before oral arguments begin at the U.S. Supreme Court on October 8.\n\n08.09.19\u2014President Trump took to Twitter to attack Fox News\u2019s Shepard Smith, an openly LGBTQ news anchor for the cable news station.\n\n07.31.19\u2014President Trump took to Twitter to attack esteemed journalist and out CNN anchor Don Lemon.\n\n07.25.19\u2014A Trump Administration official informs U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) that the government is separating families with parents who have HIV and AIDS, citing it as a communicable disease. However, the Administration admits they are not separating families who have other communicable diseases, such as the flu\u2014further stigmatizing the HIV and AIDS epidemic.\n\n07.08.19\u2014The Trump Administration\u2019s State Department creates a \u201cCommission on Unalienable Rights\u201d aimed at providing \u201can informed review of the role of human rights in American foreign policy.\u201d However, seven of the appointees have disturbing anti-LGBTQ records, putting acceptance for the global LGBTQ community at risk.\n\n06.28.19\u2014President Donald Trump used a press conference at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan to provide praise for Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, an anti-LGBTQ politician who has targeted LGBTQ people in his nation since the day he took office.\n\n06.24.19\u2014Freedom of Information Act requested documents show an effort to explain why the federal government was changing its involvement in a ceremony to honor the Stonewall Inn as a national monument and fly the LGBTQ Pride flag over federal property. The documents detail the NPS talking points: \u201cThe flag pole is not on federal property, nor is it managed by the National Park Service\u2026 The assertion that the Pride flag was the first to fly over a national monument was covered by several media outlets. A few others claimed it was the first to fly over federal property on a permanent basis. We never made this claim. The media interest in this supposed precedent is what prompted our interest in whether either statement was factually accurate. NPS never pulled our support. The permit was never in question. We staffed the event, supplied power and the amplification equipment. The only issue was whether we would have someone offer welcoming remarks. We don\u2019t do that for every event we permit on our property and we unfortunately sent mixed signals here.\u201d\n\n06.12.19\u2014President Trump failed to recognize the third anniversary of the horrific shooting at Orlando\u2019s Pulse Nightclub, which killed 49 LGBTQ people.\n\n06.07.19\u2014The Trump Administration denies all U.S. Embassy buildings from flying the historic LGBTQ Pride Flag

forces.\n\n05.24.19\u2014The Trump Administration announced a new policy stating transgender Americans would not be guaranteed health care protections under the Affordable Care Act, potentially harming 1.5 million trans Americans.\n\n05.24.19\u2014The Trump Administration announced plans to begin implementing a new policy which would allow adoption agencies to deny LGBTQ couples the ability

LGBTQ children from schools and believes discredited accusations against LGBTQ Americans.\n\n04.04.19\u2014Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson refused to reinstate housing protection

            "text": "(NewsNation) \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is on the offensive, addressing Americans\u2019 economic concerns amid poor approval ratings despite a spate of positive economic news.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq indexes all notched new records Thursday, topping all-time highs reached just Wednesday. The Dow is on the brink of hitting the 40,000 mark for the first time.\n\nThe positive economic news, however, has not lifted Biden\u2019s job approval numbers and a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the economy.\n\nDemocrats in survival mode rebuilding Biden\u2019s 2020 coalition\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump has seized on the dour outlook, posting online: Are you better off than four years ago?\n\nSenior Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz joined \u201cThe Hill on NewsNation\u201d to discuss the question, saying, \u201cI think that the president, our campaign is happy to talk about the continued strong progress the Biden economy is having for the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWages are increasing, inflation is down, jobs are being created,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you have one candidate in this race who has a proven record of fighting for lower costs, fighting against junk fees, and that is Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nRSC budget suggests raising retirement age\n\n\n\nMunoz pointed out that the U.S. is experiencing record job creation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at jobs coming back to the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cgood paying union manufacturing jobs.\n\nMunoz also Biden\u2019s effort to lower prescription drug costs.\n\n\u201cAnd then you look at Donald Trump, the guy we\u2019re running aginst,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cNot only does he have all the issues \u2026 but he also has no plan to actually address the real issues the American people want.

            "text": "As House Republicans struggled to maintain any remaining momentum they might have had in their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden during another committee hearing Wednesday, even hosts on Fox News and Newsmax seemed to be losing patience with it.\n\nPrior to the hearing, House Oversight Committee member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) appeared on Newmax\u2019s Wake Up America where host Rob Finnerty compared the committee's actions to a dog chasing its own tail.\n\nAfter noting that House Republicans have their slimmest majority yet of the current Congress, Finnerty told Jordan that unless some Democrats cross the aisle, an impeachment vote is going to be \u201creal tough.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt kind of seems like you\u2019re chasing your tail at this point, because this is not going to go anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFair question,\u201d Jordan replied. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got a small majority. Everybody understands that\u2014not just on this issue but on a host of issues. Our job, under the Constitution, is to do oversight of the executive branch. We\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re going to continue to do that.\u201d\n\nJordan didn\u2019t indicate that his committee\u2019s work would be wrapping up anytime soon, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no time limit in the Constitution on how long you can do an investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a timeline,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no specific outcome we\u2019re trying to get to.\u201d\n\nFinnerty responded by stressing that the time frame is, in fact, key, \u201cbecause if Joe Biden gets re-elected on Nov. 5, it\u2019s all for naught.\u201d\n\nYet Jordan wouldn\u2019t commit to a vote. \u201cAgain, we\u2019ll have to see where the conference is.\u201d\n\nIn the next hour on Fox News, anchor Dana Perino was similarly skeptical.\n\n\u201cAt the end of this week, Congress is set to go into recess for another two weeks, and I do think that in some ways it just feels like they keep doing the same hearing over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd people are starting to wonder: At some point, do you fish or cut bait, and do something about a vote or not, and move on to the general election?\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing included testimony from Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani, who said Republicans\u2019 impeachment push is \u201cpredicated on a bunch of false information that is being spread by the Kremlin.\u201d\n\n\u201cEventually you\u2019ve brainwashed yourself [in]to believing certain things that are not true,\u201d Parnas said of his work with the longtime Trump ally ahead of the 2020 election. \u201cI started thinking [to] myself that this can\u2019t be true. And we were doing something wrong.\u201d\n\nLast month, one of the GOP\u2019s key impeachment witnesses\u2014who said he has ties to Russian intelligence assets\u2014was arrested by the FBI for allegedly lying to the bureau about Biden and his son, Hunter. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) then tried to claim\u2014despite his past comments\u2014that Alexander Smirnov actually \u201cwasn\u2019t an important part\u201d of his investigation.\n\nDuring a break in Wednesday\u2019s hearing, committee member Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) was pressed about next steps on both Newsmax and Fox. On the former, reporter Kilmeny Duchardt asked him what the committee needs in order to \u201cfill in these holes,\u201d considering how \u201ca lot of this evidence is situational [and] circumstantial.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, Fox anchor John Roberts told Donalds that \u201cthe needle hasn\u2019t appreciably moved on this case\u201d in some time, and followed up by asking how long the investigation can continue without \u201cevidence of wrongdoing on the president\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nAlso on Fox, the network\u2019s legal editor, Kerri Urbahn, seemed to sum up the day: \u201cI do think that people are maybe becoming a little bit tired of all of this.\u201d",

            "text": "The Biden administration announced on Wednesday new regulations on tailpipe emissions that could reshape the nation\u2019s transportation sector. The rule, which calls for a 56% reduction in fleetwide average carbon emissions by 2032, constitutes the strictest-ever limit on pollution from the nation\u2019s cars and light trucks.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re setting new pollution standards for cars and trucks,\u201d Joe Biden said in a statement. \u201cUS workers will lead the world on autos making clean cars and trucks, each stamped \u2018Made in America.\u2019 You have my word.\u201d\n\nThe new standards come as part of the White House efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation is the largest source of planet-warming emissions in the US, and passenger cars and trucks account for the majority of that pollution.\n\nBy the time the rule is fully implemented in 2055, it will have cumulatively slashed more than 7bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions, senior administration officials told reporters on Tuesday. It will also tackle toxic pollution, they said, slashing fine particulate emissions by 95% and emissions of NOx and volatile organic compounds by 75%.\n\nBut the regulation has been weakened since it was first proposed last spring.\n\nThe final rule would result in the same endpoint \u2013 a 56% reduction in fleetwide average carbon emissions by 2032 from 2026 levels \u2013 but the year-over-year tightening of the pollution standards between 2027 and 2030 will happen at a more gradual pace.\n\nThe change aligns with asks from auto manufacturers and the United Auto Workers. UAW, which has long noted that EV jobs often pay less than traditional autoworker jobs, last year said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should revise its standards to increase stringency \u201cmore gradually\u201d in an effort to ensure they do not \u201cdisproportionately impact domestic union auto production\u201d.\n\nBut critics say the slower cuts will allow automakers to continue selling fossil fuel-powered vehicles longer and will produce more cumulative pollution.\n\n\u201cThis rule could\u2019ve been the biggest single step of any nation on climate, but the EPA caved to pressure from big auto, big oil and car dealers, and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the safe climate transport campaign at the environmental advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nThe rule is expected to boost to national electric vehicle sales, but it does not mandate the sale of any type of vehicle. Last spring, the EPA projected that electric vehicles would need to make up about two-thirds of car and light truck sales by 2032, up from less than one-tenth in 2023, to meet emissions reduction goals.\n\nIn a shift from the 2023 proposal, which did not mention plug-in hybrid vehicles, the EPA\u2019s final rule says manufacturers could achieve the same reduction if 56% of cars sold are fully electric and 13% are plug-in hybrids by 2032. The move comes after automakers criticized the earlier omission.\n\nThe EPA says the rule will save the nation $99bn a year, including $46bn in reduced fuel costs and nearly $16bn in auto repair and maintenance. The rule is also expected to prevent 2,500 premature deaths by 2055 thanks to cuts in pollution.\n\nSome environmental groups applauded the new limits.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two GOP lawmakers are preparing a resolution aiming to kill the rule, E&E News reports. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has said he would repeal Biden\u2019s \u201cinsane electric vehicle mandate\u201d on his first day in office.\n\nEV sales are accelerating. Last year, they were up by 54% compared with 2022, which was a 46% increase from 2021, according to Wards Auto Data.\n\n\u201cFrom plug-in hybrids to fuel cells to fully electric, drivers have more choices today,\u201d said Biden\u2019s national climate adviser, Ali Zaidi, in emailed statement. \u201cThis growth means jobs, and it means we are moving faster and faster to take on the climate crisis.\u201d",

            "text": "In February, President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign demonstrated a significant increase in fundraising, collecting $21 million, which elevated its cash on hand to $71 million. This financial boost contributed to a combined total of $97.5 million available for Biden\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), a figure that notably surpasses the $44.8 million held by former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC). These figures exclude funds from both parties\u2019 joint fundraising efforts.\n\nDespite trailing behind Trump in early polling for the general election, Biden\u2019s growing financial resources provide an edge. In contrast, Trump\u2019s fundraising this cycle has not matched his 2020 campaign efforts, partly due to funds being allocated to his legal expenses through a leadership PAC. Biden\u2019s campaign has been considerably more frugal in legal spending, reporting only $122,000 in such expenses.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign is leveraging its financial advantage to initiate a substantial advertising push, marked by a recent $30 million investment in TV and digital ads, aimed at countering Trump. Although Biden\u2019s fundraising totals still fall short of those seen in the 2020 campaign for the same period, the campaign\u2019s strategic ad spending and mockery of Trump\u2019s financial challenges underscore its aggressive approach.\n\nIn addition to ad expenditures, Biden\u2019s campaign is ramping up its operations. Following the State of the Union address, a new ad campaign targeting swing states was launched, with $1.9 million spent on advertising in just one week. The campaign also celebrated a $10 million fundraising milestone within 24 hours post-State of the Union.\n\nOperational expenses are on the rise, with February\u2019s payroll expanding from nearly $1.2 million in January to over $1.6 million. Significant investments were made in media production, travel, and text messaging, alongside notable spending at Capriotti\u2019s Sandwich Shop, a favorite of Biden\u2019s. As the campaign moves forward, it plans to significantly increase staff, particularly in swing states, indicating a strategic build-up for the forthcoming election battle.",

            "text": "Bernie Moreno, Republican candidate for Senate, speaks in Salem, Ohio, on Friday, March 15, 2024. Photo: Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images\n\nFor the second election cycle in a row, Donald Trump has intervened in a highly competitive multi-candidate Ohio Republican Senate primary and pulled off a win that reinforces his dominant position in the GOP. Trump\u2019s endorsee, auto-dealer magnate Bernie Moreno, beat State Senator (and Cleveland Guardians co-owner) Matt Dolan and Secretary of State Frank LaRose decisively on March 19. With over 96 percent percent of the expected vote in, Moreno is winning just over half the total votes and leading by Dolan by 18 percent. It\u2019s a broad-based victory, since Moreno is ahead in all of Ohio\u2019s 88 counties. (Trump won his own primary over withdrawn rival Nikki Haley by a 79 percent to 14 percent margin).\n\nMoreno is definitely over-performing expectations. He led Dolan, who was backed by Governor Mike DeWine and former senator Rob Portman, and who outspent him by a significant margin, by a spare two points in the final RealClearPolitics polling averages on the race. Trump will undoubtedly take credit for the Moreno surge, having conducted an Ohio rally with his candidate over the last weekend. But Democrats may have had something to do with the outcome; a super-PAC associated with the Democratic Party sank upward of $3 million on ads boosting Moreno among Republican voters by attacking him as \u201ctoo conservative for Ohio.\u201d It\u2019s also possible that some Democrats slipped over to the GOP primary (the Buckeye State has open primaries) to help Moreno given incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown\u2019s unopposed nomination quest.\n\nMoreno may have drawn this unfriendly assistance because he\u2019s recently gone loud and proud extremist MAGA, as opposed to Dolan, who endorsed Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy but has mostly campaigned as a standard-brand Republican conservative with some moderate leanings. Another factor could be weird recent reports linking a Moreno email account to a hookup site where someone purporting to be him solicited gay sex back in the day. That mostly matters because Moreno has trended harshly anti-LGBTQ in his current Senate race.\n\nBut at this point the Moreno primary win makes Trump two-for-two in recent Ohio Senate primaries. His late endorsement of J.D. Vance in 2022 clearly played a role in the Hillbilly Elegy author surviving a crowded GOP contest (in which Dolan was a candidate while Moreno withdrew after failing to get Trump\u2019s support). Vance went on to defeat Democratic candidate Tim Ryan by a comfortable margin.\n\nMoreno begins his general-election campaign with a lot of doubts about his viability against the perennially popular Brown, but also some advantages thanks to the high likelihood that Trump will again win the state handily (he carried Ohio by an identical 8.1 percent margin in both 2016 and 2020).\n\nIf Trump\u2019s Senate candidate wins in November, it would go a long way toward flipping the upper chamber toward the GOP and would also give Ohio a matched set of MAGA senators in Vance and Moreno. That would represent a significant devolution of the state that was the ultimate dead-even battleground as recently as 2004. Right now Sherrod Brown stands alone as a potential salvager of statewide Democratic hopes in Ohio.",

Among other things, it would make every electric utility in Vermont purchase 100% of its power from renewable resources by 2035.\n\nIt would also require that a lot more of that power come from new renewable energy sources built in Vermont and New England.\n\nCost estimates for the proposal have varied widely. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what we know so far.\n\nWhat does the bill do?\n\nUnder current state regulations, Vermont utilities have to get 75% of the power in their portfolios from renewables by 2032.

Vermont\u2019s smaller, town-owned utilities would have until 2035.\n\nFor electric utilities that are already at 100% renewable \u2014 like Washington Electric Coop and Burlington Electric Department \u2014 they will have to ensure that as their loads grow from customers switching to electric vehicles and installing heat pumps, that extra power is coming from renewables.\n\nThe bill also proposes to double the amount of power utilities have to buy from renewables built recently in Vermont. Additionally, it creates a brand new requirement that they purchase power from new renewables built in New England, which could include offshore wind in the future.\n\nMore from Vermont Public: Vermont just adopted a Climate Action Plan. Here's how it says we should reduce emissions.\n\nOn paper, Vermont has one of the least carbon-intensive electricity sectors of any state in the U.S. However, because we\u2019re part of the interconnected New England grid, and that grid is mostly powered by natural gas at any point in time, we still consume fossil fuels.\n\nBuilding new renewables in places where there is grid capacity and storage for them is one way to decrease the amount of fossil fuels New England burns as a region, and burning fossil fuels is the cause of global climate change.\n\nOne of the core debates playing out in the Statehouse is over how much Vermont should do to reduce the region\u2019s \u2014 and our own \u2014 dependence on fossil fuels in the electric sector.\n\nWhat would this bill mean for electric rates in the state?\n\nThe short answer is: What\u2019s proposed in the bill would raise electric rates. However, at this point, there is no granular modeling that shows exactly how much.\n\nWhat really has the potential to drive cost in the policy are the new renewables, particularly ones built in Vermont.\n\nLegislative analysts put out a memo this week that breaks the cost of this bill into two buckets.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the cost of buying the new renewable energy. The cost of renewables is coming down, but building new stuff always carries an upfront cost.\n\nThe Joint Fiscal Office estimates that it will cost between $150 million and $250 million by 2035 to comply with this new policy.\n\nMore from Brave Little State: How much does Vermont's power grid depend on fossil fuels?\n\nThen, there\u2019s what it might cost to upgrade our grid \u2014 the poles and wires and substations themselves \u2014 to make room for this new renewable power. There\u2019s more uncertainty there, but the analysts say they expect it could be about between $0 and $200 million by 2035.\n\nAnd that figure doesn\u2019t include upgrades to the distribution systems that utilities own \u2014 the more granular parts of the grid. There are major swaths of the state where that is constrained as well.\n\nFor context, the Department of Public Service projects Vermonters will spend $14.5 billion on electricity between 2025 and 2035.\n\nAt the end of the day, experts on all sides say these numbers are helpful, but it\u2019s still hard to know at this point what this policy change would mean for electric bills in the future.\n\nWhat do we not know about how much this will cost?\n\nLong story short: a lot. And a big part of that is that we don\u2019t really know what it will cost to upgrade our grid to be ready for these new in-state renewables.\n\nRight now, there are places where Vermont doesn\u2019t have the grid capacity for any more new renewables, and upgrades are expensive.\n\nBut VELCO \u2014 the grid operator \u2014 says there are some investors who are interested in building transmission lines that would go between Quebec and future offshore wind, potentially through the very burdened parts of Vermont\u2019s grid.\n\nVELCO says these projects \u2014 if they are successful \u2014 could help a lot to alleviate the cost to ratepayers of building out more transmission.\n\nHowever, transmission projects do fall through, as happened recently with the Twin States Clean Energy Link project. Transmission can be difficult to build in New England, so there\u2019s uncertainty there.\n\nThe Scott administration put out its own cost estimate earlier this year \u2014 at twice what legislative analysts landed on, at roughly $1 billion over the next decade. The estimate relied heavily on modeling by VELCO that looks at investments needed to ensure grid reliability. VELCO clarified those figures were not meant to forecast the cost of power \u2014 nor were they tailored to the policy proposal put forward by the legislature.\n\nThe administration has since agreed the new numbers from legislative analysts \u2014 $150 million to $450 million \u2014 are reasonable, but still view the estimate for transmission costs as being a bit low.\n\nRenewable developers contend that the cost estimate from legislative analysts should be viewed as a high-end forecast for cost, because it doesn\u2019t consider the volatility of natural gas prices in shaping electricity rates, though Vermont utilities tend to buy most of their power through long-term contracts that insulate them somewhat.\n\nAnd VELCO says even if Vermont does nothing to update its Renewable Energy Standard, our aging grid is going to need hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades to be ready for the future.\n\nAre there ways to keep that cost down?\n\nYes. Some environmental groups are saying Vermont needs a parallel policy that forces those new renewables to be built in the places where there is grid capacity for them \u2014 and load demand for them.\n\nThis would allow the state to maximize its existing infrastructure, potentially forestalling pricey upgrades.\n\nThe state doesn\u2019t require that right now, which is part of how we got to this situation of imbalance \u2014where parts of the grid are at risk of being overburdened.\n\nThe Scott administration has advocated for only requiring as many new in-state renewables as we have capacity for with existing infrastructure. Renewable developers and most environmental groups contend this bill does just that.\n\nAdditionally, the Joint Fiscal Office says utilities could play a role in mitigating costs by building out storage and creating more programs to spread out electricity use over the course of the day, like incentivizing people to charge their electric vehicles at night, for example.\n\nWhy do lawmakers feel this is necessary right now? What do people say about whether we should do this?\n\nVermont\u2019s Climate Action Plan and Comprehensive Energy Plan both call on the state to go to 100% carbon-free electricity.\n\nEven though there\u2019s been disagreement between lawmakers and the Scott administration over how to get there, both bodies support that transition.\n\nAn earlier proposal from the Scott administration had proposed requiring every utility in the state reach 100% clean energy, which would include nuclear power, by 2030, with lower requirements for purchasing new renewables.\n\nThe administration argues the emissions benefit from that approach, for Vermont, would be greater sooner than what is proposed now \u2014 though TJ Poor, director of utilities planning for the Department of Public Service, acknowledged in an interview that the societal emissions benefit of H.289 is greater because it requires utilities to support more new renewables.\n\nH.289, the bill heading to the House floor, has broad support from utilities in the state and from renewable developers, as well as several environmental groups, including VPIRG.\n\nHowever, some conservative lawmakers and the environmental group Vermonters for a Clean Environment \u2014 which has often opposed new renewable energy development in the state over concerns about land use \u2014 say Vermont\u2019s power is clean enough as it is.\n\nAnd they point out that utilities and renewable developers, who broadly support the bill, stand to benefit financially from it \u2014 especially from this requirement for new renewables within Vermont.\n\nTo date, no one has modeled how much the bill would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Vermont, or in the region.\n\nAnnette Smith of Vermonters for a Clean Environment says she has concerns about whether the bill asks Vermonters to pay for environmental benefits people in other states will enjoy.\n\nHowever, she supports elements of the policy \u2014 including eliminating group net metering and efforts to stand up a community solar program in the state.\n\n\u201cBut the rest of this \u2014 changing the requirements for in-state [renewables] and for totals by certain years? We\u2019re not ready for it,\u201d she says.\n\nMore from Vermont Public: New report explores how sourcing 100% of Vermont's electricity from renewables would affect rates\n\nOthers say Vermont needs to do everything it can to fight climate change right now, and cleaner electricity is part of that.\n\nRep. Laura Sibilia is an Independent from Dover who sits on the House Energy and Environment Committee, and says lawmakers are also deeply concerned about affordability. She called the earlier, more speculative forecast from the Scott administration \u201cpolitical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe energy transition is not optional,\u201d she said in early March. \u201cHow we act in it \u2014 we have a lot of options. But it\u2019s happening. Vermonters themselves are driving that transition, global markets are driving that transition.\u201d\n\nTJ Poor, director of utility planning for the Department of Public Service, says his department would like to see the cost of distribution system upgrades included in the analysis.\n\n\u201cI think the focus is that there are costs. They are significant. And there are ways to mitigate the potential risk of those costs,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I hope that this legislation \u2026 as it goes forward, that that can be an improvement.\u201d\n\nBen Edgerly-Walsh, with VPIRG \u2014 which has lobbied in support of the bill \u2014 says the numbers say otherwise.\n\n\u201cI think that what the Joint Fiscal Office has confirmed is that this is an affordable way of deploying a whole lot of new renewable energy,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve testified to all along and when they dove deeper into the substance of the bill, that\u2019s exactly what they found as well.\u201d\n\nVermont is part of the U.S Climate Alliance, a group of 25 states that have agreed to keep complying with the Paris Accords, even if our federal government pulls out, which we did under former President Donald Trump \u2014 though President Joe Biden has since rejoined. As the presidential election approaches, there are many who make the case that there is power in individual states taking action on climate change.\n\nHave questions, comments or tips?

            "text": "WASHINGTON: The Home impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden is at a crossroad, missing the political urge for food from inside the Republican ranks to go ahead with an precise impeachment, however dealing with political strain to ship after months of labor.\n\nThe chairman of the Home Oversight and Accountability Committee, Republican Rep. James Comer, pushed forward at Wednesday\u2019s public listening to, claiming that the Democratic president was both \u201ccomplicit\u201d in his son Hunter Biden\u2019s enterprise dealings promoting the Biden model or \u201cincompetent\u201d within the household funds.\n\nHowever Comer has additionally signaled an curiosity in taking the inquiry into one other route, stopping in need of drawing up articles of impeachment towards the president and eyeing potential prison referrals of alleged Biden household wrongdoing to the Justice Division for attainable prosecution.\n\nWith Hunter Biden declining to look on the listening to after having testified privately final month, Comer stated earlier on Fox Information that there could be \u201ca number of\u201d prison referrals. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to finish nicely for the Bidens,\u201d the Kentucky lawmaker stated.\n\nIt\u2019s the beginning of a possible winding down for the prolonged GOP-led probe that was launched after Republicans seized management of the Home in January and had been keen to carry Biden to the excessive bar of impeachment. The Home, underneath a Democratic majority, had twice impeached Republican Donald Trump throughout his presidency.\n\nAs Trump and Biden face one other seemingly rematch this November, Comer is weighing whether or not to maintain the impeachment inquiry going by way of Hunter Biden\u2019s usually difficult enterprise dealings and troubled private life or wrap up work even when that falls in need of impeachment.\n\nThe committee\u2019s prime Democrat, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, stated in his personal opening remarks {that a} \u201ccomedy of errors\u201d of the Biden impeachment inquiry is lastly \u201ccrashing to an finish.\u201d\n\nThe White Home has referred to as the inquiry a \u201ccharade\u201d and instructed Republicans to \u201ctransfer on.\u201d\n\nThe committee asserts that the Bidens traded on the household title, an alleged influence-peddling scheme during which Republicans are attempting to hyperlink a handful of telephone calls or dinner conferences between Joe Biden, when he was vp or out of workplace, and Hunter Biden and his enterprise associates.\n\nHunter Biden, who\u2019s dealing with firearm and tax fees in separate issues, testified behind closed doorways final month in a deposition that crammed greater than 200 pages however left Comer\u2019s committee with out the exhausting proof it was searching for of wrongdoing by the president or his son.\n\nRepublicans had been utilizing the listening to to look deeper into Hunter Biden\u2019s enterprise dealings, insisting it\u2019s the president and never his son that they\u2019re scrutinizing.\n\nTestimony was coming from a solid of surprising witnesses, some with difficult backgrounds.\n\nJason Galanis is serving a prolonged federal jail sentence in Alabama for fraud schemes and appeared remotely earlier than lawmakers. Tony Bobulinski, a onetime enterprise affiliate of Hunter Biden, took his claims towards the household public in the course of the first Trump-Biden presidential debate in 2020.\n\nThe Democrats referred to as Lev Parnas to testify, counting on the convicted businessman who was central to Trump\u2019s first impeachment as a Rudy Giuliani affiliate working to dig up political filth on Joe Biden earlier than the 2020 election. Parnas has since performed a key function in dispelling the Home GOP\u2019s major declare of bribery towards the Bidens.\n\nTestifying by way of video, Galanis instructed lawmakers he anticipated to make \u201cbillions\u201d with Hunter Biden and different associates, utilizing the Biden household title of their international enterprise dealings.\n\nGalanis described a selected time in Might 2014 when Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone for a short chat with potential international enterprise companions \u2014 a Russian oligarch and her husband \u2014 throughout a celebration at a New York restaurant.\n\nIn earlier testimony Galanis, who was sentenced for a number of fraud schemes, acknowledged that he unsuccessfully sought a pardon within the last days of the Trump presidency.\n\nHunter Biden, in his personal deposition final month, testified he met Galanis for about half-hour 10 years in the past.\n\nBobulinski instructed the committee that he met twice with Joe Biden in 2017 throughout a convention in Los Angeles, by way of Hunter Biden, together with as soon as for 45 minutes.\n\nWhereas Hunter Biden has testified that his father was by no means concerned in his enterprise dealings, Bobulinski declared that \u201cblatant lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that Joe Biden was the model,\u201d Bobulinksi stated.\n\nParnas instructed the committee that in all his work abroad, he has seen \u201czero proof\u201d of Biden household corruption.\n\nEarlier than his personal conviction, Parnas had been a central determine in Trump\u2019s first impeachment over withholding help to Ukraine.\n\nParnas described serving to Giuliani peddle the false claims to conservative media. Trump\u2019s crew claimed that Joe Biden, as vp, had intervened within the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor to assist Hunter Biden\u2019s work on the board of the Ukrainian power agency Burisma. Western allies additionally needed the prosecutor fired over allegations of corruption.\n\nThe Home Republicans launched their Biden impeachment inquiry final 12 months relying partially on unverified claims from an FBI informant launched by Senate Republicans that disclosed allegations of funds to the Bidens. The now former FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, was arrested final month and pleaded not responsible to fees that he fabricated the bribery allegations.\n\nParnas instructed the committee that lawmakers knew the knowledge was unverified. Final summer season, he had despatched Comer a prolonged later dispelling these claims, saying it was all speak and the cash was not paid to the Bidens.\n\nWith the Home\u2019s slim GOP majority narrowed additional by early retirements, Republicans might not have sufficient assist inside their ranks to pursue articles of impeachment towards the president, particularly as a result of Democrats would seemingly vote towards any such fees.\n\nAs a substitute, Comer has been wanting into potential prison referrals to the Justice Division, which might seemingly be symbolic however may open the door to prosecutions in a future administration.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who would precisely be charged, and over what offenses.

            "text": "The Biden administration on Thursday said it is forgiving almost $6 billion in student debt for 77,700 borrowers, with those recipients scheduled to receive an email from President Joe Biden alerting them about their debt cancellation.\n\nThe people who qualify for the latest round of student loan forgiveness are public service employees, such as teachers, nurses, social workers and firefighters, the White House said in a statement. On a per-person basis, the forgiveness amounts to about $77,000 per person.\n\nEver since the Supreme Court last year invalidated the Biden administration's plan for broad-based student loan forgiveness, the Biden administration has sought to rely on existing and new loan repayment plans to provide debt relief to almost 4 million people. Americans are carrying about $1.77 trillion in student debt, a financial burden that some college grads say has made it tougher to achieve financial milestones like buying a home.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to fix problems in the nation's student loan repayment system by rolling out a new program called SAVE and making it easier for public servants to get their debt erased.\n\n\"For too long, our nation's teachers, nurses, social workers, firefighters and other public servants faced logistical troubles and trapdoors when they tried to access the debt relief they were entitled to under the law,\" said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. \"With this announcement, the Biden-Harris Administration is showing how we're taking further steps not only to fix those trapdoors, but also to expand opportunity to many more Americans.\"\n\nWho qualifies for student loan forgiveness?\n\nThe Biden administration said 77,700 borrowers who are enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program will receive debt forgiveness.\n\nThose who are receiving debt forgiveness include public servants who enrolled in the Biden administration's limited PSLF waiver, which allows public sector workers who haven't previously qualified for loan relief to receive credit for past repayments, the administration said.\n\nWhat were the prior problems with the PSLF program?\n\nThe PSLF program, which has been around since 2007, had the lofty goal of forgiving the student debt of Americans who work in public sector jobs, such as teachers or government employees, for at least 10 years.\n\nBut its notoriously Byzantine regulations and misleading guidance from some loan-servicing companies meant that few public servants managed to get debt relief. In fact, only 7,000 people received forgiveness through the PSLF prior to the Biden administration.\n\nSince the White House made changes to PSLF, about 871,000 Americans have received student loan forgiveness through the program, the Biden administration said.\n\nHow will I know if I got PSLF debt forgiveness?\n\nThe 77,700 borrowers who qualify will receive a letter from President Biden next week congratulating them on their relief.\n\nI'm enrolled in PSLF. Will I get loan forgiveness, too?\n\nAnother 380,000 people enrolled in PSLF will receive an email from Biden next week letting them know they are within one to two years of qualifying for debt forgiveness through the program.\n\nAccording to a sample email, Biden will congratulate them and urge them to continue working in public service to qualify for forgiveness. One email reads, \"I hope you continue the important work of serving your community \u2014 and if you do, in less a year you could get your remaining student loans forgiven through Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\"\n\nDeadline approaches as Trump struggles to pay $464 million bond in fraud case\n\nSneak peek: Who Poisoned Angela Craig?\n\nHow an AI-powered robot provides companionship to lonely seniors",

            "text": "A few days after former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley dropped out of the Republican presidential primary on March 6, veteran media executive and Haley backer Harry Sloan got a call from movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked Sloan to help President Joe Biden take on Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nSloan agreed to help raise money for Biden\u2019s reelection effort and try to reel in Republican-aligned business leaders to get behind the president, he told CNBC in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cPeople I know who are generally business Republicans, they\u2019re going to hear from me\u201d about helping Biden, Sloan said. The former chair of MGM said he has already reached out to some of the people in his Rolodex, and he plans to host a fundraiser for Biden later this year.\n\nSloan is among at least half a dozen former Haley bundlers who have decided to help Biden \u2014 and not Trump \u2014 since Haley ended her campaign, according to a source familiar with the effort, who was granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nA co-chair of the Biden campaign, Katzenberg has been trying to recruit wealthy Haley supporters into Biden\u2019s camp since at least February.\n\nBut now, with Haley formally out of the race, that effort has gone into overdrive.\n\nSloan and other Haley supporters have also heard from the Biden campaign\u2019s finance chair, Rufus Gifford, who said he belongs to a WhatsApp group called \u201cHaley Supporters for Biden.\u201d\n\nFor Biden\u2019s team, successfully snagging Republican former Haley donors would amount to a fundraising coup, bolstering the president\u2019s political operation while taking these potential donors off the field for Trump.\n\nThe effort to win over Haley donors also got a boost when Trump threatened to blacklist Haley donors.\n\n\u201cAnybody that makes a \u2018Contribution\u2019 to [Haley] from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don\u2019t want them, and will not accept them,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social on Jan. 24.\n\nHaley notably did not endorse Trump when she dropped out of the race.\n\nSloan himself is a major addition to Biden\u2019s fundraising arsenal. While Haley was still in the primary, Sloan helped to raise at least $550,000 for her White House bid, most of it through two fundraising receptions, including one at his home in Los Angeles.\n\nBut Sloan is not a straight party-line donor. He has donated in the past to candidates on both sides of the aisle, including $100,000 last year to a pro-Biden political action committee, Future Forward, and a separate donation to Biden\u2019s campaign.\n\nSloan also gave $100,000 to a PAC that supported Haley, according to Federal Election Commission records. Another Republican who received a donation from Sloan is Pennsylvania GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick.\n\nThe never Trump wing\n\nBarbara Comstock, a former Virginia Republican congresswoman who was co-chair of Haley\u2019s campaign, is also working against the Trump candidacy.\n\n\u201cI support the Republican Voters Against Trump efforts. I also support Republicans for Ukraine,\u201d Comstock told CNBC in an email. \u201cStill figuring out what other things would be most helpful.\u201d\n\nComstock said that if she chooses to include fundraising in her efforts, Republican Voters Against Trump does operate through a super PAC called Republican Accountability.\n\nThe super PAC recently announced plans to launch a $50 million general election effort to defeat Trump.\n\nThe project will feature videos of former Trump voters explaining why they won\u2019t back him again in 2024. The clips and quotes will appear on television, radio, billboard and digital ads targeting voters in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe super PAC is largely funded by anti-Trump donors. LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman contributed $4 million last year to the group, according to campaign finance records. Hoffman also donated $250,000 to a pro-Haley PAC.\n\nHoffman has donated at least $2 million more to the Republican Accountability PAC so far this year, his political advisor Dmitri Mehlhorn told CNBC.\n\nRepublican Accountability also received $2 million in 2023 from Defending Democracy Together, a political nonprofit led by Bill Kristol, an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s and a former aide in the Reagan administration.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

It will air on platforms, including YouTube and Meta, across battleground states, according to the campaign.\n\n\"It\u2019s not hyperbole to say that affordable health care for millions of people is on the line in November,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement about the ad. \"I am more determined than ever to beat back MAGA Republican attacks and make health care a right and not a privilege in America.

            "text": "On April 7, 1992, then-Senator Joe Biden criticized those who interfered in Israel\u2019s affairs.\n\nHe declared: \u201cThe absurd notion that publicly vilifying Israel will somehow change its policy; who in the hell do we think we\u2019re dealing with? What makes us think, even if the administration is 100% correct on the policy, what makes them think that in the midst of an election campaign, in the midst of a so-called peace talk, that we can publicly vilify a nation, persons, and think that a leader is going to say, now I will yield before the world and God, because I\u2019ve been told? What in the hell do we think we\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\n\n\nBiden noted, \u201cWhy, why is there any incentive for the Arabs to make any compromise, any compromise, in the peace talks? Why, if they know that they must only wait for the United States to do their bargaining for them? Why would they compromise? Why would they be reasonable?\u201d\n\nInterestingly, James Baker was serving as secretary of state at the time. Baker is infamous for his comment \u201cF\u2014 the Jews, they don\u2019t vote for us anyway.\u201d Baker\u2019s comments proved a self-fulfilling prophecy. His boss, President George H.W. Bush, went from 35% of the Jewish vote in 1988 to 12% in the 1992 election, which he lost to Bill Clinton.\n\nBaker wasn\u2019t the first to make such a miscalculation. President Jimmy Carter\u2019s Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan warned Carter that his policies towards Israel would alienate American Jews. Carter ignored him and went from 71% of the Jewish vote in 1976 to 45% in the 1980 election he lost to Ronald Reagan.\n\n\n\nToday, President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer appear to have adopted the same failed strategy, except to them, the watchword is, in effect: F\u2014 the Jews, they\u2019ll vote for us anyway. But just as Baker and Carter were wrong to discount the Jewish vote, those who do so now to justify policies hostile to Israel do so at their own peril.\n\nBy strange coincidence, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman is again playing a major role in all this. Back in the early \u201890s, Friedman played tennis with Baker and served as the press mouthpiece for Baker\u2019s policy of blaming Israel for the lack of Middle East peace. At the time, Baker and Bush were pressuring then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to forgo his insistence on bilateral negotiations. They did so by threatening to withhold U.S. loan guarantees intended to assist Israel in absorbing a million olim from the Soviet Union.\n\nToday, Friedman is once again a mouthpiece, this time for the Biden administration\u2019s policy of attacking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel\u2019s defensive war against Hamas. Rather than insist on Hamas surrendering and releasing all the hostages\u2014including the American ones\u2014which would end the war immediately, the administration is more interested in pandering to a few thousand Muslim voters in swing states who hate Israel and often support Hamas. This is an offensive and self-destructive policy.\n\nThere are already strong signs that, as a result of his misguided approach, Biden is hemorrhaging Jewish support. A Sienna poll of New York voters found former President Donald Trump winning the Jewish vote by a wide margin. This is in keeping with the results of the 2020 election, which saw Trump\u2019s share of Florida\u2019s Jewish voters rise from 23% in 2016 to 41%.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of American Jews and Americans in general support Israel and disdain Hamas. The exponential rise in antisemitic incidents and failure of Biden\u2019s vaunted plan to combat antisemitism, as well as his failure even to mention the problem in his State of the Union address are also leading many Jews to drop their support for Biden.\n\nIn 1992, Friedman and Baker inadvertently undermined Jewish support for the Republican Party. Friedman and Biden are now doing the same to the Democrats. History demonstrates that sitting presidents who turn on Israel always end up in failure and defeat.\n\n\n\nImage - Reuters",

Brown\n\nBiden highlighted the impact of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and emphasized the injection of $1 billion into Nevada to provide affordable housing and housing assistance.\n\nPresident Joe Biden arrived in Las Vegas, Nevada, today to announce a bold plan to tackle the pressing housing crisis gripping the nation. Against skyrocketing housing costs and a severe shortage of affordable homes, the president outlined his strategy to lower housing costs and increase the housing supply for American families.\n\nBiden highlighted the impact of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and emphasized the injection of $1 billion into Nevada to provide affordable housing and housing assistance. Noteworthy among these investments is the allocation of $700 million towards affordable housing supply, leading to significant developments, including several 200-unit affordable housing projects and approximately 1,000 new senior apartments in Clark County.\n\nBiden\u2019s housing agenda, as detailed in his Fiscal Year 2025 Budget, earmarks a historic $258 billion for housing investments. Key proposals include measures to reduce barriers to homeownership, such as the proposed Mortgage Relief Credit, which would offer middle-class first-time homebuyers a tax credit of $10,000 over two years, along with down payment assistance for first-generation homebuyers and initiatives to lower closing costs.\n\nThe president\u2019s plan also prioritizes increasing housing supply through tax credits, innovative grant funds, and enhanced contributions from financial institutions. Notable among these initiatives are the expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the introduction of a Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, intended to construct or renovate millions of affordable rental units and starter homes nationwide.\n\nFurthermore, Biden\u2019s plan includes provisions to address unfair rental practices, combat rent gouging by corporate landlords, and eliminate burdensome rental fees. These measures aim to foster a fair rental market while expanding housing choice vouchers to alleviate financial strain on renters.\n\nAcknowledging Nevada\u2019s role in the housing crisis, Biden commended the state\u2019s proactive use of ARP funds, which have facilitated significant strides in affordable housing. Notable achievements include the construction of thousands of new units in Clark County and providing down-payment assistance to hundreds of Nevadans.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s housing plan arrives at a critical juncture as the nation grapples with the enduring repercussions of the pandemic. With bipartisan support and concerted action, the president\u2019s vision for a more equitable housing landscape promises to transform the American dream into reality for millions across the country.",

            "text": "To hear the Biden Administration tell it, U.S. agriculture represents a shining beacon for the world\u2019s farms at a time of accelerating climate chaos. In December 2023, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack made the case in Dubai at COP28, the latest iteration of the United Nations\u2019 annual climate talks. Hailing the success of his country\u2019s \u201cincentive-driven and market-based\u201d policy mechanisms for keeping farmers on a \u201cclimate-smart\u201d path, Vilsack insisted that \u201cthere\u2019s no need for us to be defensive\u201d about the American way of growing food. \u201cWe can articulate proactive leadership in the climate space\u2014leadership that I think is reflected in a number of opportunities for us to showcase what U.S. farmers and ranchers are doing to mitigate and adapt to a changing climate and doing it in a sustainable, substantive way.\u201d\n\nVilsack\u2019s rosy view likely found a welcome audience among participants from COP28\u2019s host country. Back in 2021, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United Arab Emirates launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate), a public-private effort to generate \u201cinnovative, science-based solutions to increase food security and help agriculture and food systems mitigate and adapt to climate change.\u201d Vilsack vowed the project would \u201clead to rapid and transformative climate action across the world.\u201d In a USDA forum earlier that year, he presented the project as a \u201cmarket-oriented, incentive-based, voluntary\u201d alternative to the European Union\u2019s then-newly hatched \u201cFarm to Fork\u201d strategy, which called for cuts to pesticide and fertilizer use as well as reduced meat consumption as a response to climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\nAt the 2023 COP meeting, Vilsack shared a stage with Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, the petrostate\u2019s minister of climate change and environment, to extol AIM for Climate. By then, most of the globe\u2019s biggest pesticide, seed, fertilizer, and meat companies\u2014whose lobbyists swarmed the conference in Dubai\u2014had signed on to the project as partners. In an interview with reporters at the confab, Vilsack made clear his vision for a climate-smart food future did not include ramping down production of meat, the source of most of agriculture\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, he insisted, technical fixes would enable industrial-scale meat production to expand without cooking the planet\u2014a position not unlike Big Oil\u2019s pitch that carbon-capture technologies can enable fossil fuel combustion indefinitely. (U.S. eaters stand near the top of the global food chain in terms of per capita meat consumption, and only Brazil exports more meat than the United States.)\n\nOn the surface, the United Arab Emirates makes an odd comrade in an effort to define best practices for farming in a warming world. Situated in a desert, the UAE imports nearly 90 percent of its food supply, meaning that its domestic farming sector is minimal. But the UAE does possess massive oil and natural gas reserves\u2014and natural gas is the main feedstock for producing synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, the lifeblood of industrial-scale agriculture and the main water pollutant in the ag-intensive regions of the United States and Europe. Back in 2019, to diversify its profit streams away from just selling oil and gas, the UAE\u2019s state-owned fossil fuel conglomerate, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, jumped into the fertilizer business by launching Fertiglobe, a joint venture with the Dutch firm OCI Global. These days, Abu Dhabi National Oil owns an 86 percent stake in Fertiglobe, which calls itself the world\u2019s \u201clargest nitrogen fertilizer and ammonia exporter.\u201d In other words, the USDA has aligned itself on the global stage with a nation that stands to profit from the proliferation of the very kind of chemical-intensive agriculture that reigns in the United States.\n\nOne glimmer of hope for more environmentally friendly farming lies in the Inflation Reduction Act. It provides $17 billion in funding for conservation practices over the next seven years; spending this money wisely, and not using it to merely greenwash the status quo, is going to be crucial. Because while our agriculture secretary conducts his affable marketing blitz on behalf of current American farming methods, the land where they have most completely taken root\u2014the upper Midwest\u2014tells a different story. Rather than representing a triumph of climate resiliency and wise agricultural policy, the once-glorious cache of topsoil that blankets the U.S. heartland is quietly withering away. Vilsack\u2019s sunny view aside, if we have any hope of thriving in a climate that\u2019s warmer and more volatile than humans have ever experienced before, we\u2019ll have to steer sharply away from, not hew to, the agricultural path we\u2019re on.\n\nIn 2021, a team of University of Massachusetts Amherst scientists, led by geomorphologist Isaac Larsen, began publishing a series of papers examining the scale of soil erosion in the U.S. corn belt\u2014a broad swath of land stretching from Nebraska to Ohio and as far south as Missouri. They didn\u2019t choose the region casually. It accounts for around 90 percent of U.S. corn production, and about 80 percent of soybeans. Iowa, the heart of the corn belt and the state Vilsack once served as governor, devotes more than 85 percent of its land to farming\u2014of which 95 percent is planted in corn and soybeans. (\u201c[I]n Iowa, Indiana, and Illinois, less than 0.1 percent of the original tallgrass prairie remains,\u201d Larsen et al. note.) In turn, these corn belt crops suffuse the U.S. food supply, providing the feed for the factory-scale livestock farms that deliver nearly all of our meat (as well as ample exports) and the bulk of the sweeteners and oils that make America\u2019s ultra-processed diet so palatable. They also help move us around, literally. By government mandate\u2014a policy long championed by Vilsack\u2014more than a third of U.S. corn output gets burned in our gas tanks in the form of ethanol, a gasoline additive that provides about 7 percent of the energy consumed in internal combustion cars. Soybean-derived biodiesel has a growing share of the much smaller U.S. diesel market.\n\nGiven our reliance on the corn belt for sustenance and transportation, it would be comforting to think, as Vilsack suggests, that its soil is being managed in a way that ensures future bumper harvests. Robust soil health in our heartland would support Vilsack\u2019s pitch on the global stage: We\u2019ve cracked the code for sustainable agriculture amid climate change\u2014so farm as we farm, and the food supply is safe. The work of Larsen and his team exposes this idea as a dangerous delusion.\n\nIn their first paper, published in 2021 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, they used satellite imagery to gauge the presence of what\u2019s called A-horizon soil, the carbon-rich, loamy, dark stuff. It\u2019s the plum resource the United States claimed when it seized the region from indigenous people in the nineteenth century. Settler-farmers encountered\u2014and quickly flattened, drained, and plowed\u2014tallgrass prairies, wetlands, and riparian savannas, characterized by hundreds of species of perennial wild grasses and legumes. Flowers and grasses towered over the newcomers\u2019 heads, their roots plunging just as deep into the earth, burying carbon snatched from the atmosphere. Vast herds of bison ate their way through meadows, stimulating new plant growth, recycling nutrients, and feeding soil-borne microbes with their manure. Native American peoples played an active role in managing the ecosystem: They periodically set fires that quickly freed nutrients and prevented trees from establishing, allowing prairie plants to thrive without being shaded out. These interactions among people, plants, animals, microbes, and climate\u2014building on silt deposited by melted glaciers at the end of the Ice Age\u2014left behind one of the planet\u2019s largest accumulations of top-quality soil. It\u2019s what allowed the corn belt to emerge as a breadbasket in the first place, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ll need in place as the climate warms, because its water-holding capacity makes it more resilient to increasingly frequent droughts and heatwaves.\n\nOur most important farming region is an ecological wasteland in the making.\n\nLarsen and his team found that fully one-third of the U.S. heartland\u2019s A-horizon soil has already washed away, leaving behind much lower-quality subsoil. These degraded swaths of land require higher doses of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer to keep churning out crops, increasing water pollution and food production costs, the paper states. Already, the researchers estimate, this widespread erosion is pinching overall corn belt crop yields by around 6 percent and causing nearly $3 billion in annual economic losses.\n\n\u201cI was surprised at how visually striking the erosion can be,\u201d Larsen told me in an interview. \u201cThere can be a drop of several feet between native prairie remnants and the farm fields that are next to them. When you look at the satellite imagery, the soil on the hilltops is a light-tan color that is nothing like the dark, organic-matter-rich soil that is what the Midwest is known for.\u201d\n\nIn a later paper, published in 2022, the group came out with an even more startling finding. Understanding it requires a brief dive into science geekery. The soil that blankets a landscape is a dynamic system\u2014even under pristine conditions, it\u2019s always washing away at the surface under pressure from rain, wind, and tillage, and generating anew down below, as bedrock weathers and releases inorganic material that binds with organic matter to become soil. When soil erodes at a higher rate than it regenerates, your farming system is essentially mining a resource that took millennia to form. Scientists refer to the rate at which a landscape\u2019s soil naturally regenerates as \u201cT,\u201d short for tolerable soil loss rate. In most of the corn belt, the USDA considers T to stand at roughly 5 tons per acre annually. According to the department\u2019s own tracking, Iowa\u2019s farmland is eroding at about 5.8 tons per acre annually. This rate suggests that the region is surrendering soil about 1.16 times faster than it naturally forms. Most experts would say that situation isn\u2019t something to tout as a global agricultural model, perhaps, but also that it\u2019s probably nothing requiring immediate policy attention.\n\nBut experts have long warned that the USDA\u2019s T value is dubious. While I was researching my 2020 book Perilous Bounty, veteran Iowa State University soil scientist Richard Cruse told me the USDA had based its T assumption on \u201cnot much at all.\u201d The calculation behind a tolerable loss rate of 5 tons per acre rested on a misunderstanding of a flawed paper published in the journal Agricultural Engineering way back in 1941, he said. Cruse noted that there has been little research on T specific to the corn belt, but that he suspected the real number to be closer to 0.5 tons per acre.\n\nLarsen and his team have filled the research void. Analyzing the presence of a rare element called beryllium-10 in soil samples taken throughout the region (an established method for gauging historical erosion rates) for a paper published in the journal Geology in 2022, they came up with an estimate for the rate at which corn belt soils eroded before settlement. This figure provides a solid proxy for the region\u2019s actual T, Larsen told me, because before it came under the plow, the landscape\u2019s soil cache remained in rough balance: Lost soil didn\u2019t exceed new soil formation. Their finding: The region\u2019s median pre-agriculture erosion rate\u2014and thus its real T\u2014is about 0.2 tons per acre per year. That\u2019s one-twenty-fifth of the USDA\u2019s assumption of 5 tons per acre. So rather than eroding at 1.16 times the rate of natural replenishment, Iowa\u2019s soil is disappearing nearly 30 times faster than it replenishes. This is why Larsen\u2019s team could see drops of several feet into farmland. \u201cOur results indicate that tolerable soil erosion, as currently defined [by the USDA], will lead to the depletion of midwestern soils,\u201d the paper dryly concludes. In other words, we\u2019re looking at a mounting crisis, not a mere concern. A third of the corn belt\u2019s soil has vanished; what\u2019s left is rapidly moving toward the same fate. Rather than representing an advertisement for agricultural resilience in the face of climate change, our most important farming region is an ecological wasteland in the making.\n\nI asked Larsen whether anyone in U.S. farm policy circles\u2014from the USDA, or the staffs of the lawmakers who make up the House and Senate agriculture committees\u2014had contacted him about his research. No one had, he said.\n\nWhen Vilsack speaks of the United States\u2019s \u201cincentive-driven,\u201d \u201cvoluntary\u201d approach to agriculture policy, he\u2019s giving an accurate appraisal. It didn\u2019t start that way. The current U.S. policy regime developed during the Great Depression, after a boom in demand for crops like wheat and corn triggered by World War I ultimately went bust, causing prices to tumble. Farmers responded in a way that made sense for individual players but proved disastrous for the overall farm economy: by pushing their land to churn out more crops, hoping to make up on volume what they were losing on price. The result was a spiral of overproduction and soil erosion on a grand scale, leading to the twin catastrophes of mass farm failures and the Dust Bowl.\n\nNew Deal farm legislation sought to address the situation with a policy known as \u201csupply management.\u201d To prevent chronic overproduction, the USDA would annually set limits for the number of acres farmers could devote to staple crops like corn and wheat, hoping to stabilize farmer incomes at a level on par with the salaries of urban workers while keeping food prices affordable for consumers. But the post-World War II era also marked the advent of industrial agriculture: the rise of petroleum-powered tractors and high-yielding hybrid seeds, along with the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides (byproducts of war technology) the seeds needed to thrive. This technological revolution caused crop yields to soar and prices to plunge. As the USDA tried to manage supply with its acreage limits, it also hotly promoted the new technologies by offering farmers subsidized loans to finance the purchase of advanced farm machinery, hybrid seeds, and chemicals. (The systemic denial of such credit to African American farmers essentially led to a net transfer of millions of acres from Black to white landowners, as historian Pete Daniel showed in his great 2013 book Dispossession: Discrimination against African American Farmers in the Age of Civil Rights.) In short, the farm-tech boom swamped the USDA\u2019s ability to help farmers make a living. Crop prices fell steadily between 1945 and 1970, over which time the number of U.S. farms plunged from over five million to under three million.\n\nAround that time, U.S. ag policy took a turn. In place of acreage limits, Nixon\u2019s Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz urged farmers to \u201cplant fencerow to fencerow,\u201d without fear of overproduction and price drops. Butz vowed to find foreign markets for any excess\u2014and in 1972, he could point to a massive deal to sell corn and wheat to the Soviet Union, which caused prices to spike the following year. Following Butz\u2019s advice to \u201cget big or get out,\u201d many farmers took on debt to buy more land and bigger combines and apply more chemicals to maximize yield. What followed, predictably, was a crash in prices (the famous 1980s farm crisis) and a surge in soil erosion so severe that the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) saw fit to issue a scathing report calling attention to it.\n\nIn the decades since, in deference to an emerging agribusiness lobby that benefited from booming sales of pesticides, fertilizers, high-tech seeds, and farm equipment, Congress and successive administrations cobbled together the current policy regime, the one Vilsack extolls. Through the farm bill\u2014the twice-per-decade omnibus federal legislation that governs agriculture policy\u2014we dole out billions of dollars annually (in the form of cash payments and subsidized crop insurance) to incentivize farmers to maximize output of a few commodity crops, including corn and soybeans. Butz\u2019s promise that exports would sop up any surpluses and stabilize prices never panned out. Since a 1975 peak, corn and soybean prices have drifted steadily downward in inflation-adjusted terms, a trend only interrupted by the government-induced corn ethanol boom of the late aughts and, more recently, the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both of which goosed prices for a time. Subsidies (and subsidized crop insurance) keep farmers pumping out corn and soybeans in down years.\n\nSince 1985, the farm bill has also included a \u201cconservation title.\u201d As University of Illinois professor and former USDA official Jonathan Coppess shows in his forthcoming book Between Soil and Society: Legislative History and Political Development of Farm Bill Conservation Policy, the provision emerged in direct response to the jump in erosion caused by the 1970s boom. As a result, the USDA now dangles money to encourage farmers to adopt practices that soften the ecological damage of all-out production\u2014stuff like off-season cover crops, whose foliage buffers soil from the erosive impact of spring rains, and whose roots help hold it in place. The voluntary nature of these programs made them palatable to the agribusiness lobby, and to the farmers whose operations got big enough to survive the post-World War II shakeout. The American Farm Bureau Federation\u2014an insurance juggernaut that\u2019s tightly allied with the agribusiness industry and wields a potent lobbying arm\u2014has helped cultivate a dominant ideology among the corn belt\u2019s large-scale growers wherein subsidies and below-market crop insurance are birthright, while regulation denotes the overreach of jack-booted government scoundrels.\n\nFor every dollar the USDA flashed to entice farmers to grow all-out, it offered less than 13 cents\u2019 worth of incentives to clean up their messes.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the farm bill\u2019s two conflicting policy impulses\u2014dumping dollars on maximized production and pennies on voluntary conservation\u2014don\u2019t come close to balancing out. According to an Environmental Working Group analysis of USDA farm bill spending, between 1995 and 2021, the federal government spent almost $400 billion on production incentives versus $49.4 billion on conservation. That means that over the past quarter-century, for every dollar the department flashed to entice farmers to grow all-out, it offered less than 13 cents\u2019 worth of incentives to clean up their messes. It\u2019s no wonder that the USDA\u2019s two most important conservation programs, the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program, are \u201croutinely oversubscribed and have more applicants than available funding, leaving many producers without critical support,\u201d as a 2023 study by the Bipartisan Policy Center found.\n\nThe case of cover crops illustrates how U.S. farm policy\u2019s skew toward all-out production plays out on the corn belt landscape. In 2021, despite years of being a main emphasis of USDA conservation funding, cover crops had been planted on just 7.2 percent of the Midwest\u2019s acres, a 2022 analysis of satellite data by University of Illinois researchers found. An underfunded, voluntary conservation effort will never be able to rein in the corn-soybean behemoth underwritten by the farm bill\u2019s vast production incentives. As Vilsack likes to point out, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act bolstered farm bill conservation funding by adding $15.2 billion to the USDA\u2019s budget over the years 2024 to 2031, a bump of an average of $1.9 billion annually over that time frame. That\u2019s a welcome increase, but it\u2019s not nearly enough to put conservation dollars on par with, much less solve, the programs\u2019 oversubscription problem.\n\nI have been hard on Tom Vilsack in this essay, but he\u2019s hardly to blame for the form of agriculture that\u2019s destroying the corn belt\u2019s most crucial resource. After his stint as an agribusiness-friendly governor of Iowa, Vilsack served for eight years as President Barack Obama\u2019s agriculture secretary, and then swished through the revolving door between the USDA and the agribusiness giants it regulates by taking a post as a marketing executive for the dairy industry. He held that job (annual salary: nearly $1 million) until he returned to lead Biden\u2019s USDA. He\u2019s a functionary\u2014a servant to, not a shaper of, the agricultural status quo. But he embodies the Democratic center\u2019s deep inertia on matters of farm policy, and its longstanding alliance with the agribusiness interests that extract profits from the corn and soybean trade. The three dominant providers of seeds and pesticides (Bayer, Syngenta, and Corteva) and the big fertilizer firms (Nutrien, CF Industries, and Mosaic) are like shovel suppliers during a gold rush: They flourish as long as the diggers (in this analogy, farmers) can stay in the game, and farm subsidies ensure that a solid core of them do. Other beneficiaries of the resulting mountains of inexpensive corn and soybeans are the meatpacking titans that turn cheap feed into profitable nuggets, chops, and burgers (Tyson, JBS, and Smithfield).\n\nVilsack and his wing of the party help prop up the Democrats\u2019 end of a bipartisan consensus with old-school GOP legislators like South Dakota Senator John Thune that maintains the soil-ruining status quo. During his presidency, Donald Trump smashed many norms, but the tendency to parachute cash into the corn belt was not among them. \u201cLook, I did get you [farmers] $28 billion, in all fairness, right?\u201d the former President boasted to an Iowa audience ahead of the caucuses in January. \u201cWho the hell else would get you $28 billion from China?\u201d The figure was accurate, Politico reported, but the China bit was a lie. Under Trump, the USDA (not China) paid farmers a $28 billion windfall as compensation for lost business from the then-President\u2019s trade war. Even so, the publication noted, farmers got the same total amount in federal subsidies in Biden\u2019s first three years in office as they did in Trump\u2019s.\n\nAnd yet, Vilsack isn\u2019t wrong in wanting to present the world with a vision for a robust policy for managing agricultural resources in a time of climate change. What would such a thing look like?\n\nAn excellent first step would be to phase out corn-based ethanol, which, as I noted above, now consumes 30 percent of the U.S. corn crop to generate a gasoline additive for internal-combustion cars. If the Biden Administration\u2019s push to make gas-burning cars obsolete by incentivizing a transition to electric vehicles succeeds, ethanol\u2019s days are numbered anyway. As I recently argued in a piece for The New Republic, putting solar panels on just 3 percent of corn belt acres now devoted to corn for ethanol would generate more net energy. Such a move (no easy lift given the lobbying weight behind ethanol) would open vast swaths of land to new uses besides corn.\n\nFrom there, it\u2019s no major puzzle to identify farming methods that preserve soil while also maintaining a bountiful food supply. No-till farming, when combined with cover crops, reliably prevents erosion. Then there\u2019s simple crop biodiversity. At Iowa State University, a group of scientists has been running field experiments since 2001 on the effect of broadening crop rotations beyond just corn and soybeans. Adding oats combined with red clover to the mix, they have shown in a series of papers, slashes erosion and requires a fraction of the water-fouling fertilizer and herbicides needed by the corn-soybean duopoly.\n\nAgroforestry\u2014combining stands of nut or fruit trees with crops or livestock pasture\u2014provides another proven way of holding soil in place while delivering plenty of food. The idea of trees rising from the Midwest\u2019s carpet of corn and soybeans might sound fanciful. But amid the tall-grass prairies and wetlands early settlers encountered, forests covered much of the region. In its eastern part, \u201copen oak woodlands and savannas climbed the hills and lined ridgetops,\u201d and \u201c[d]enser floodplain forests filled river bottoms everywhere,\u201d reports Cornelia Mutel in her book The Emerald Horizon: The History of Nature in Iowa. Restoring some of that could bring dramatic benefits. A 2018 paper by University of Illinois researchers found that growing black walnut groves in rows between annual field crops would deliver more profits to landowners than field-crop-only farming on nearly a quarter of the region\u2019s land.\n\nThe climate and soil-preserving benefits of widespread adoption of agroforestry in the corn belt would be profound. Tree roots dig deep beneath the soil surface and fan out laterally, providing an anchor for soil during heavy rain. They also soak up nutrients all year long, keeping fertilizer from leaching away and polluting water, and their canopy shields crops and soil from the ravages of wind and rains. Meanwhile, they trap carbon in the soil as their leaves fall and decompose and store it in their roots, trunks, and branches.\n\n\u201cIf you take government subsidies, you should do something for them.\u201d\n\nDespite mounting evidence of the benefits of diversifying crop rotations and adding trees and solar panels to the corn belt landscape, such practices remain vanishingly rare. Silvia Secchi, a natural resource economist at the University of Iowa, fixates on a policy tweak that could conceivably unleash such innovation. Rather than allowing conservation to be swamped by subsidies, make it a condition for receiving subsidies (a concept I floated in a column for the March/April 2024 edition of Mother Jones). If you\u2019re a farmer and expect support from the USDA, then show the agency your plan for preserving topsoil, minimizing chemical runoff, and slashing greenhouse gas emissions. That way, federal farm programs can achieve their New Deal aims: provide a safety net for farmers, while also helping preserve the soil on which agriculture relies. Participation would be voluntary\u2014farmers could continue to run their operations as they please\u2014meaning the Farm Bureau would have a hard time painting it as a power grab by zealous regulators. The basic principle: \u201cIf you take government subsidies, you should do something for them,\u201d Secchi says.\n\nThe idea of tying ecological conditions to farm aid is not novel in the history of U.S. farm policy. Jarred by the erosion crisis of the 1970s, Congress and President Ronald Reagan (over the objections of budget director David Stockman, who wanted to slash funding for all farm programs, Coppess reports) passed the 1985 farm bill, which decreed that if farmers wanted to receive aid to grow crops on land deemed \u201chighly erodible\u201d by the USDA, they had to come up with a plan to retain soil on their fields. \u201cConservation compliance,\u201d as the policy is known, had to overcome \u201cstrong resistance from farm interests\u201d to make it into the farm bill, Coppess writes.\n\nToday, requirements for \u201chighly erodible\u201d land remain in effect, but they are routinely ignored, mainly because of spotty USDA enforcement. A scathing 2003 General Accounting Office report found that the USDA had \u201cnot consistently implemented the 1985 [farm bill\u2019s] conservation provisions,\u201d and as a result, \u201csome farmers receive federal farm payments although their soil erodes at higher rates than allowed.\u201d A 2016 report by the USDA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General found much the same situation more than a decade later. And research from Secchi and colleagues found the 1985 compliance rule did little to slow the surge in corn production triggered by the government-backed ethanol boom that began in 2007. The USDA\u2019s own data bring the policy\u2019s failure into view. In Iowa, soil erosion on land deemed \u201chighly erodible\u201d dropped from about 19 tons per acre in 1982 to just over 11 in 1997. Since then, however, the rate has hovered around 12 tons per acre a year\u201460 times the tolerable rate calculated by Larsen and his team.\n\nThis abject policy failure doesn\u2019t mean the USDA couldn\u2019t in theory successfully enforce conservation compliance for all acres. But doing so would require expanding the agency\u2019s enforcement budget and imposing rigorous congressional oversight, Secchi says.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to imagine getting there in the current political landscape, dominated by Vilsackian Democrats and Trumpy Republicans. But in the last decade, a new tendency has emerged to challenge this ill-conceived bipartisan consensus. In the 2020 primaries, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Cory Booker ran for the Democratic presidential nomination on ag-policy platforms promising to bust up the dominant agribusiness behemoths and restore crop diversity in the heartland. In the campaign, Joe Biden took a gentler approach to corporate power in farming, in line with the wisdom of his top rural adviser\u2014none other than Vilsack. Nearly a year before the Iowa caucus, the once and future USDA chief argued on a podcast that the bust-\u2019em-up approach wasn\u2019t a \u201cwinning message\u201d in rural areas, because of the \u201csubstantial number of people hired and employed by those businesses here in Iowa.\u201d (This was nonsense: Agribusiness firms employ a tiny number of workers in farm states, and actual farmers make up a tiny percentage of the population.) In the end, Sanders finished in a virtual tie for first place in that year\u2019s Iowa caucus, and Warren ended a strong third. Together, they claimed 44 percent of the state\u2019s delegates, nearly three times Biden\u2019s haul.\n\nThese days, Sanders and Warren are formidable players in the Senate, and Booker has a seat on the upper chamber\u2019s agricultural committee, which has a big role in shaping the farm bill, the next version of which is due by September 30, 2024. (The deadline was extended for a year after negotiations around it collapsed in the fall of 2023, a victim of a House Freedom Caucus uprising.) It\u2019s highly unlikely that a more soil-friendly farm bill will emerge this year, but the 2024 election will reshuffle the deck, dealing our soil resources an even worse hand if Trump retakes the White House and/or Republicans gain ground on Capitol Hill.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s that extra $17 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act directed to \u201cclimate-smart\u201d farming over the next seven years. It\u2019s not enough to solve the soil crisis, but it\u2019s better than nothing. Already, congressional Republicans are predictably scheming to redirect it to boost no-strings-attached payments to farmers in the farm bill now being hammered out in Congress. Democrats on the Hill have to defend it, and the USDA should make sure that it\u2019s directed toward practices proven to hold soil in place, like the ones described above. As University of Washington geomorphologist David Montgomery noted in his magisterial 2007 book Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations, \u201cWith just a couple feet of soil standing between prosperity and desolation, civilizations that plow through their soil vanish.\u201d",

In announcing the decision, Biden said the U.S. needs to \"maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers.\"\n\nThe news comes after United Auto Workers (UAW) President Shawn Fain endorsed Biden for president in 2024 in January, taking several swipes at Trump in the process.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFani Willis, the embattled Fulton County District Attorney, plans to press ahead with her goal of putting Donald Trump on trial before the November election, and intends to ask the judge presiding over the Georgia criminal case to schedule a trial date as soon as this summer, according to three people familiar with her thinking.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold move considering the hurdles Willis faces in getting the case back on track after a two-month detour revealed embarrassing details of her personal life, damaging her credibility in the eyes of Judge Scott McAfee and leaving her politically vulnerable ahead of her own reelection bid in November.\n\nWillis narrowly avoided being disqualified over her romantic relationship with lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who resigned last Friday following a blistering rebuke from McAfee, publicly questioning both Wade and Willis\u2019s decision-making. On Wednesday McAfee granted requests from Trump and his co-defendants to seek an appeal, meaning the threat of disqualification still hangs over Willis.\n\nGeorgia Republicans continue to investigate allegations that Willis benefitted financially from her relationship with Wade. A state Senate committee could use its subpoena power to unearth new information and plans to meet several more times to hear from additional witnesses.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed changes into law that give a state commission the power to investigate Willis and authority to remove or sanction state prosecutors.\n\nWillis\u2019s rock-solid political standing has also been shaken. This month, Democrat Christian Wise Smith, a former Fulton County prosecutor and Atlanta solicitor, launched a campaign challenging Willis in the May 21 primary. Republican lawyer Courtney Kramer, an attorney who worked in the Office of the White House Counsel under Trump, has also joined the race.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Supreme Court\u2019s looming decision on whether the former president enjoys absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges, one that could affect various criminal proceedings against Trump. Any ruling in favor of the former president from the high court could be a major blow to both criminal cases against Trump related to the 2020 election, including in Georgia. Hearings begin in April, with a decision expected by the end of June.\n\nSources close to the Fulton County DA\u2019s office say the uncertainty of the federal case does not prevent McAfee from setting a trial date. Fulton County prosecutors said in a recent email to defense attorneys they planned to respond to Trump\u2019s immunity claim within two weeks of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, according to a source familiar with the correspondence.\n\nProsecutors believe McAfee can put the immunity issue to the side until the Supreme Court rules while, in the interim, ensuring the Georgia case is as close to ready as possible if the justices decide Trump can be prosecuted, multiple sources familiar with the thinking inside Willis\u2019s office tell CNN.\n\nMultiple sources close to Willis acknowledge the last two months have been a major distraction, one they admit was brought on by her own actions but also enabled, they argue, by how much leeway McAfee gave defense attorneys to attack Willis during the disqualification proceedings.\n\n\u201cBasically, this is a two-month sideshow that the judge should have not even let happen,\u201d one Willis ally told CNN. \u201cBut it\u2019s over and the judge finally came to the right decision \u2026 and so now we\u2019re back to where we never should have left, which is these people were under felony indictment. Let\u2019s get a trial date.\u201d\n\nSources close to Willis tell CNN that the DA\u2019s office is effectively ready to go to trial. Willis has said she needs only 30 days to prepare once a date is set. Defense attorneys have had since September to review the evidence and prepare their own arguments.\n\nWillis had previously asked for a trial to start in August 2024. Sources tell CNN she plans to re-up the request now that she has survived the chaotic two months \u2013 which saw the entire Fulton County DA\u2019s office face disqualification and threatened to derail the entire case.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when Willis will make her second request of McAfee to set a trial date. The Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s office has declined to comment to CNN for this story.\n\nAshleigh Merchant, the defense attorney who led the effort to disqualify Willis, was asked by CNN\u2019s Laura Coates on Wednesday night if the defense was trying to delay the trial until after the upcoming 2024 election.\n\n\u201cI would very much like to go to trial,\u201d Merchant said, adding that the defense has a right for a \u201cfair and impartial\u201d prosecutor to evaluate the case. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen in this case,\u201d Merchant said.\n\nWillis and her team are aware of the political damage caused by the last two months but argue that their job is to prosecute the facts of the criminal case against Trump and his co-defendants, not worry about the political reverberations it causes.\n\nNathan Wade attends a hearing on February 27 in Atlanta. Brynn AndersonPool/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere was definitely damage done,\u201d said former Dekalb County District Attorney Robert James, who watches the case closely and told CNN that even if Willis can get the case to trial before November\u2019s election, picking a jury alone could take months, especially with so many defendants involved.\n\n\u201cUltimately some of the prospective jurors that watched those hearings have formed negative opinions of the DA and this case,\u201d said James. \u201cIt was always going to be difficult to get a fair and impartial jury. The hearing on the motion to disqualify just made it more difficult.\u201d\n\nOne source told CNN that Willis and her team realize the damage inflicted could diminish the public\u2019s perception of the Georgia case ahead of what is likely to be a polarizing 2024 election. But that person also betrayed a sense of anger over the spectacle that was made of the televised hearings.\n\n\u201cYou have people covering this, frankly, like it was sports or politics,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt deals with political activity, but there\u2019s not an election going on in court. There are elections going on, but not in court.\u201d\n\nJudge \u2018rolling up his sleeves\u2019\n\nSince his disqualification ruling, McAfee has indicated he is ready to continue moving forward, with sources familiar with the case saying he has asked attorneys on both sides about how to proceed with pre-trial motions.\n\nRecent communications from McAfee include questions about which motions needs oral argument and what needs more briefing before he can rule on them, one source told CNN.\n\nFulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images/File\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s rolling up his sleeves,\u201d one source said about McAfee.\n\nThat\u2019s not to discount the fallout from last week\u2019s 23-page opinion from McAfee, which amounted to a highly-critical rebuke of Willis\u2019s actions, describing her relationship with Wade being the result of \u201cbad choices.\u201d\n\nMcAfee wrote that Willis\u2019s comments at an Atlanta-area church in January about the case were \u201clegally improper.\u201d\n\nHe also warned of the potential for a future gag order against Willis, but said her church comments were far enough removed from a jury trial that it would not \u201cestablish a permanent taint of the jury pool.\u201d\n\nMichael Moore, a CNN legal analyst and former US attorney in Georgia, questions whether Willis should even remain on the case, and says if she does, she will need to show McAfee and the public that she is in complete \u201ccontrol.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question that the progress of the case has been impeded by unnecessary speed bumps and detours,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe simply cannot afford another unforced error that results in additional unfavorable comments questioning her candor or judgment.\u201d",

            "text": "Topline\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s ex-business partner, Tony Bobulinski, a primary witness in the GOP-led impeachment probe into President Joe Biden, accused Democrats of lying to the media in an explosive House Oversight Committee hearing Wednesday\u2014widely viewed as a last-ditch effort in the inquiry as Republicans have begun to acknowledge it appears to be coming to a close.\n\nKey Facts\n\nIn his opening statement before the committee, Bobulinski accused Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., of lying to the media. He also alleged Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, Abbe Lowell, has tried to \u201csmear\u201d him, while defending what he described as a \u201csuccessful business career\u201d following his time in the Navy. Raskin jumped in, asking Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., if Bobulinski was subject to decorum rules, while Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., reportedly shouted \u201ckeep going, you fool!\u201d Bobulinski, who worked briefly with Hunter Biden in 2017 on a company called Sinohawk, has claimed to possess evidence showing the president profited from his son\u2019s business deals in China, including a widely cited email that allegedly references \u201c10% held by H for the big guy,\u201d which Bobulinski has repeated claimed is a reference to the president. Bobulinski\u2019s claims have never been verified, however, and multiple other witnesses have told the committee the president was not involved in his son\u2019s business ventures.\n\nTangent\n\nMoskowitz wore a Vladimir Putin mask around the Capitol before the hearing to mock Republicans for spreading allegations about the Bidens that reportedly stem from Russian disinformation.\n\nChief Critic\n\nRaskin accused Bobulinski of making \u201chazy allegations against the Bidens for the first time at a press conference choreographed by the Trump for President campaign,\u201d he said in his opening statement, referring to the 2020 press conference in which Bobulinski initially aired the allegations. Referencing the possibility that the GOP could make criminal referrals to the Justice Department based on their findings, Raskin said \u201ccriminal referrals require evidence of crime . . . and the only crimes we have seen are those of the GOP\u2019s own star witnesses alike,\u201d he said, referencing Alexander Smirnov, who claimed Biden and his son were involved in a bribery scheme and was recently indicted by the FBI for allegedly lying to the agency.\n\nKey Background\n\nBobulinski testified before the committee alongside former Hunter Biden business partner Jason Galanis and former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. The committee also requested Hunter Biden\u2019s appearance, but he declined to participate, with Lowell calling the hearing in a letter to Comer \u201can obvious attempt to throw a Hail Mary pass after the game has ended.\u201d The hearing comes as a growing number of Republicans have openly acknowledged the probe is unlikely to result in a formal impeachment of the president as it has not produced any evidence showing the president was directly involved in, or financially benefited, from business deals involving his son or other family members.\n\nContra\n\nParnas in his testimony before the committee repeated his claims that any damning information about the Bidens was the product of Russian disinformation, telling lawmakers \u201cevery person integral to this shadow diplomacy knew that the Biden corruption rumors were baseless,\u201d he said, accusing Fox News anchors and Trump allies, former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., of \u201cpushing a false narrative.\u201d Parnas, who was enlisted by Giuliani to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, was later convicted of fraud and campaign finance violations for funneling money into the 2018 midterms to help a Russian national gain interest in the cannabis industry.\n\nRead More",

            "text": "By nearly 2-to-1, voters believe President Joe Biden is using the Justice Department to hobble former President Donald Trump and jail him so that he can\u2019t win the fall election.\n\nIn the latest McLaughlin and Associates survey shared with Secrets on Wednesday, 56% said they believe that \u201cJoe Biden wants to stop President Trump from winning the election by putting him in jail.\u201d Some 30% disagreed.\n\nRepublicans, 86% to 8%, agreed, as did independent voters, 50% to 33%. But so did many Democrats \u2014 32% agreed to 48% who didn\u2019t.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, voters said they believe Biden is playing a key role in driving the investigations of his rival. Some 58% said Biden has a role. Of that, 40% called his role \u201cmajor.\u201d\n\nThe former president faces dozens of charges in several cases as he enters the heat of the 2024 election. He has often decried the Biden effort as something Third World dictators try. One Trump insider also compared what Biden\u2019s Justice Department is doing to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign against his foes.\n\nThe Trump pollster also asked voters if Biden should pull his prosecutors back and let the election play out. Voters, by an even bigger margin, said they would applaud such a move, 58% to 34%.\n\nPollsters John and Jim McLaughlin\u2019s latest survey showed that despite the punishing criminal and civil cases facing Trump, the Republican has expanded his lead over Biden in the last month.\n\nTrump now leads nationally at 49% to 43%, up from 47% to 43% last month.\n\nIn addition to feeling that Biden is persecuting his foe, voters also feel that \u201cBidenomics\u201d is sinking them. A majority of voters said they are struggling under inflation, and 83% said the president\u2019s economic program has \u201cimpacted\u201d them.\n\nIn national polls, Trump has generally held a lead and one far bigger than he did in any 2020 or 2016 survey. More importantly than the national popular vote, he has also started to expand his leads in battleground states that will determine the Electoral College outcome.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nOn Wednesday, for example, two more polls showed that Trump has a lead over Biden in Arizona and Nevada. Both are from an Emerson College Polling/Hill survey.\n\nIn Arizona, Trump leads Biden 48% to 44%. In Nevada, it\u2019s Trump over Biden, 44% to 41%.",

And it has given Biden a new line of attack against his opponent on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Donald, I'm sorry I can't help you,\" Biden told supporters at a fundraiser Wednesday night in Dallas, reciting a joke about a man coming up to him with crushing debt.\n\nBiden's reelection campaign reported raising $21.3 million in February, nearly double the $10.9 million raised by the Trump campaign, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, giving the incumbent Democratic president $71 million cash on hand at the end of February compared to $33.5 million for Trump's campaign.\n\nWhen combined with money raised by the Democratic National Committee in February, Biden has a war chest of $97.5 million for the general election, more than double the $44.8 million cash on hand across Trump's main campaign account and the Republican National Committee.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nA full picture or the campaign fundraising won't be clear until other joint committees affiliated with the campaigns release their latest fundraising figures to the FEC at a later time. But Biden's fundraising advantage is indisputable at this point.\n\nFactoring in the efforts of all their affiliated committees, the Biden campaign said it raised $53 million in February, giving the president $155 million in the bank still to spend \u2212 the most ever for a Democratic presidential candidate at this point in the election cycle.\n\nOne of Trump's affiliated committees, the Save America PAC, reported having $4.1 million on hand at the end of February after spending more than $7.2 million the same month led by $5.6 million on legal fees and services, according to the committee's monthly disclosure.\n\n\"We\u2019ve said Donald Trump is in dire financial straits,\" Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement. \"We said his campaign is struggling and doesn\u2019t have the ability to build a winning coalition. We just didn\u2019t know it was THIS bad.\"\n\nTrump faces massive penalties in court following recent judgements. The former president has been able to get a bond in his New York civil fraud case to shield his assets as he appeals a $454 million judgment for fraudulently over-valuing his real estate empire.\n\nTrump this month posted a $92 million bond to block columnist E. Jean Carroll from collecting on her $83.3 million judgement as Trump appeals her defamation victory.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not address the disparity when asked to comment on Biden's fundraising lead. \u201cAmericans know that they were better off with President Trump four years ago than with Crooked Joe Biden and his disastrous policies,\" Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We need a return to America First policies that successfully kept our country safe and supercharged the economy for all Americans.\u201d\n\nBiden has been on a multi-day campaign swing this week that included two fundraisers in the Dallas area on Wednesday. A fundraiser in Houston is set for Thursday.\n\nNext week, Biden is holding a fundraiser in New York with former president Barack Obama and Bill Clinton in what will be the campaign's highest profile fundraiser to date.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.",

It means a lot to Jill.\n\nAnd thanks to all of you for your support, including all of the lawyers here today who care deeply about the rule of law, and \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and you\u2019re are on the frontlines of fairness, justice, and defending democracy.\n\nYou know, if I \u2014 the first time I met down here, if I talked about, \u201cwe have to defend democracy,\u201d you all looked at me like I was \u2014 had too much to drink upstairs. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd, folks, we\u2019re seeing incredible enthusiasm all over the country. I\u2019ve traveled since we\u2019ve gotten the \u2014 since we announced formally in \u2014 to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Nevada, Arizona. And Jill and Kamala and Doug are traveling as well.\n\nOur grassroots support keeps getting stronger. So far, we have 1,300,000 people who have contributed to our campaign \u2014 1,300,000 \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and 500,000 of them brand-new \u2014 and 97 percent are people who contributed under $200. It\u2019s a real grassroots thing. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re ramping up our campaign headquarters and field offices, opening nearly 100 offices in the last several weeks \u2014 or actually mo- \u2014 a little \u2014 about a month and a half \u2014 and hiring staff all across the country before Trump and his MAGA Republicans have even \u2014 even opened one headquarters.\n\nAnd while we probably haven\u2019t read a lot about it, in the last few days, there has been five national polls. The press \u2014 well, I like the press \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but they don\u2019t talk about it very much. Five national polls having us leading since my State of the Union Address. (Applause.)\n\nFolks \u2014 folks, but I know not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm. The other day, a defeated man \u2014 looking man came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, I\u2019m being crushed by debt. I\u2019m completely wiped out.\u201d And I had to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Donald, but I can\u2019t help you.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019d like to. Not much I can do. (Laughter.)\n\nSpeaking of Donald Trump, just a few days ago, he asked the famous question: Are you better off today than you were yesterday? Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question. (Laughter.)\n\nI hope everyone in the country takes a moment to think back where they were in March of 2020.\n\nCOVID had come to America, and Trump was president, and hospitals and emergency rooms were overwhelmed. First responders were risking their lives. Nurses were literally wearing garbage bags for protection in hospitals, and ventilators were in short supply. Mobile morgues were set up. Loved ones were dying all alone, and we couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to them.\n\nAnd unemployment shot up to 14 percent. The stock market crashed, and your grocery store shelves were empty. And the toilet paper panic \u2014 remember that one? (Laughter.)\n\nWell, Trump tried to downplay the virus. He told us, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll go away. Just stay calm. We\u2019ll be out of this by Easter.\u201d All while doing simply nothing.\n\nOf course, we know from Bob Woodward\u2019s book that Trump was lying to the American people and he knew it all along. He knew how dangerous the virus was, but he hid it from us.\n\nHe just kept \u2014 it kept getting worse. He told Americans \u2014 remember when he said inject bleach? (Laughter.) I think he must have done it. (Laughter.) He told us to hit the body with UV light, which I\u2019m confident he does. (Laughter.)\n\nBut, look, by the summer, Americans peacefully protested for justice in front of the White House, and what did he want? He wanted to tear gas them and \u2014 for a photo op.\n\nAnd after losing the 2020 election, char- \u2014 he finished his presidency by literally sending a mob to attack the Capitol.\n\nFour years later, we\u2019ve come a \u2014 pretty far. Donald Trump is not president, that\u2019s a starter. I am, because of you. (Applause.)\n\nI look out, I see so many of you who got me through in 2020. You \u2014 many of you have been with me a long time.\n\nCOVID is \u2014 no longer controls our lives. We\u2019ve created 15 million brand-new jobs, more jobs than any president has in (inaudible). (Applause.)\n\nWe have the lowest unemployment rate \u2014 lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. (Applause.)\n\nWe have a record economic growth, record small-business creation. Stock market is highest it\u2019s ever been. I know that doesn\u2019t matter to you all, but it\u2019s real. (Laughter.)\n\nInsulin for seniors now costs 35 bucks instead of 400 a month. Out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs for seniors are going to be capped at the end of this month [year] at $2,000 a year no matter what the cost is, including those cancer drugs that are $10-, $12-, $15,000.\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t just save \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and, by the way, that just doesn\u2019t seniors money; it saves significant amounts of money for the \u2014 and reduces the deficit.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve done so far by dealing with Medicare being able to negotiate, which I\u2019ve been trying to do when I was a senator for years \u2014 we finally got it done, without much help from the other team \u2014 actually, without any help from the other team. (Laughter.) We\u2019re \u2014 but guess what? It cut the federal deficit by $160 billion \u2014 $160 billon. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads, bridges; delivering clean water, high-speed Internet to every American.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is booming. I never knew where it was written \u2014 it says we can\u2019t still lead the world in manufacturing. Eight hundred thousand new jobs since we \u2014 you got me elected the first time and still counting. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019ve attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment for clean energy, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors \u2014 all across America.\n\nWe made the biggest investment in history to combat climate. And we do more, of course \u2014 we have to do more.\n\nInflation peaked at 9 percent, but now it\u2019s down \u2014 dropped to 3 percent, the lowest in the world, and it\u2019s still going down. And with the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbors, and the crick not rising, as my grandfather would say, it\u2019s going to continue to go down.\n\nBut we can more to do.\n\nLet me ask you: Does anyone want to go back to 2020?\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well \u2014 when \u2014 when fear ruled our lives when Trump was President? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nBut, look \u2014 look, folks, the problem isn\u2019t looking back to where the country \u2014 where Trump had the country. The problem is where he wants to take it now. Look at what he\u2019s saying, and he means what he\u2019s saying.\n\nI don\u2019t \u2014 you know, I made a speech when I \u2014 you got me nominated and I was first elected be- \u2014 while I was running in 2020 \u2014 at \u2014 at Independence Hall, saying our democracy was at risk. And a lot of the press thought it was a bit of hyperbole, but I don\u2019t think anybody thinks that anymore.\n\nHe wants to get rid of \u2014 this guy wants to do a whole lot that is contrary to what we\u2019ve been done \u2014 what\u2019s been done. He says he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Forty million Americans depend on that ACA.\n\nHe wants to get rid of savings I just got put into law to lower prescription drug prices, to 35 bucks for insulin for seniors.\n\nHe wants to enact another $2 thousand [$2 trillion] tax cut \u2014 they\u2019re not bad, if you can pay for it \u2014 the very wealthy and the biggest corporations. It\u2019s increased the debt larger than any president has in a four-year period.\n\nAnd, folks, if anyone doubts Trump and the Republicans would cut Social Security and Medicare, just look at what they said and done in the past week.\n\n\n\nTrump recently said about Social Security and Medicare, which is a lifeline for millions and millions of Americans \u2014 he said, \u201cThere\u2019s\u201d \u2014 quote, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do in terms of cutting.\u201d\n\nAnd just yesterday, 180 House Republicans in the House of Representatives took orders from him again, and they proposed to cut Social Security and Medicare and ch- \u2014 and up the age.\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve got a better idea. I\u2019ll protect Social Security and Medicare.\n\nLook, folks, he also \u2014 he\u2019s also a climate denier. He wants to do away with historic actions on climate we\u2019ve had.\n\nAfter another school shooting about a month ago, what did he say? Remember the famous quote? He said, \u201cWe just got to get over it.\u201d \u201cJust got to get over it.\u201d\n\nWell, I just want to stop it.\n\nIt\u2019s the same guy who, when he was talking about what happened in Normandy, he said \u2014 and they wanted to go to the gravesites, he said no. He said they\u2019re a bunch of \u201closers\u201d \u2014 a bunch of \u201closers.\u201d My son was one of those \u201closers.\u201d I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t standing with him. Not at Normandy, but in \u2014\n\nLook at the judges he put on the bench. Imagine who else he\u2019ll put on the bench if he gets reelected.\n\nOur reputation internationally was being crushed when he was president. Imagine what happens if he gets reelected. He wants to walk away from NATO. He tells Putin: Do, quote, \u201cwhatever the hell you want.\u201d\n\nHe hosts Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n of Hungary at Mar-a-Lago, and says he doesn\u2019t think democracies work \u2014 at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump brags about how he\u2019s the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned and the freedom to choose was taken away. America needs to know Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists are now calling for a national ban in every state in the Union \u2014 every state in the Union.\n\nOne more thing. Trump didn\u2019t just bring chaos into our \u2013lives of women. He\u2019s also bringing chaos in Am- \u2014 at the Amer- \u2014 at the American border. You know this, in Texas, better than anybody.\n\nYou know, with a group of bipartisan senators, led by a very conservative senator from Oklahoma, we negotiated for weeks and agreed on the strongest national security, border security law in American history: 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve all these cases in six months instead of six years, because it takes six to eight years now to resolve these cases \u2014 it\u2019s chaos; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines that significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.\n\nBut Trump was worried \u2014 and this is the truth. Trump was worried \u2014 and it got bipartisan support. It looked like it was going to go through the Senate. And Trump got on the phone and started calling and \u2014 the senators. And he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be for it. You can\u2019t be for it,\u201d even though they liked it and it was strong, and he liked it. Because he couldn\u2019t stand the thought that we\u2019d get credit for something.\n\n\n\nFolks, this wasn\u2019t about whether it was good for me or Trump. This is about what\u2019s good for America.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do, unlike Donald Trump: I\u2019m not going to demonize immigrants. I\u2019m not going to say immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the nation. I\u2019m not going to call immigrants and folks from Mexico \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers\u201d just because they\u2019re from Mexico. I\u2019m not going to separate families.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m gon- \u2014 I\u2019m not going to end \u2014 the thing that bothers me most \u2014 I met a \u2014 a young man yesterday with his mom and dad, who were immigrants, and he\u2019s a very good student. He was born in America. Trump wants to do away with birthright citizenship \u2014 a fundamental decision made by our founders: If you\u2019re born in America, you\u2019re an American no matter what. He wants to do away with that \u2014 to do away with that.\n\n\n\nI find it to be outrageous. You know, I\u2019m not going to ban people either because of their religion. That\u2019s not who we are in America.\n\nBut for all the threats Trump poses to our economy, our standing in the world, is \u2014 the greatest threat he poses: to our democracy. The violence on January 6th \u2014 Trump embraced it, and he\u2019s running on it.\n\nIf you watch any of his rallies, he\u2019s \u2014 calls the insurrectionists in pri- \u2014 who are in prison \u2014 calls them \u201cpatriots.\u201d And he says if he\u2019s reelected, he\u2019s going to pardon them all.\n\n\n\nTrump now says if he loses again in November that there will be a \u201cbloodbath.\u201d A \u201cbloodbath.\u201d\n\nFolks, we can\u2019t stand for all this. We have to say with one voice as Americans \u2014 as Democrats, as independents, as Republicans \u2014 there\u2019s no place in American politics for political violence ever. Period. Period. (Applause.)\n\nLet me close with this. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, but with your help, we\u2019ll win up and down the ticket. That includes here in Texa- \u2014 I\u2019d love to see Colin take on Cruz \u2014 (applause) \u2014 so Ted can join loser Donald Trump. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nLook, there\u2019s a lot of focus these days on how old I am and how old Trump is. Well, the real question is: How old are our ideas?\n\nTrump\u2019s vision for America is one of anger, hate, revenge \u2014 seriously \u2014 and retribution \u2014 some of the oldest ideas known to humankind.\n\nI have a very different view for America, one that focuses on our future and answers whether \u2014 some very important questions: Will we be better off four years from now?\n\nWell, here\u2019s what I see.\n\nI see a future where we defend democracy; we don\u2019t diminish it.\n\nI see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect the freedoms that they\u2019re tak- \u2014 been taking away.\n\nI see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy begin to pay their fair share \u2014 and many of you do.\n\nI see a future where we save the planet from climate crisis and our country from gun violence.\n\nAbove all, I see a future for all Americans, you know, where we demonize no one, where we \u2014 hate has no safe harbor, where we leave nobody behind.\n\nThat\u2019s the future that we build together. That\u2019s the reason \u2014 that\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve never been more optimistic \u2014 I really believe it \u2014 as I go around the country. Our country is ready.\n\n\n\nLook, this is really a race about values between Trump and me, between us and Trump \u2014 a value set. Because I really do believe the American people are decent, honorable. They \u2014 they respect dignity.\n\n\n\nMy dad used to have an expression. My dad was a well-read man, and he got into Johns Hopkins when he was in Baltimore. He got into Johns Hopkins when we was \u2014 during the war \u2014 just before the war, but he ended up working in the shipyards and didn\u2019t get to go.\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s what he \u2014 he used to say, \u201cJoey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about respect. It\u2019s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \u2018Honey, it\u2019s going to be okay.\u2019 It\u2019s about just having an even chance. Not being given it \u2014 just an even chance.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, we have to remember who in the hell we are. We\u2019re the United States of America. And there is nothing \u2014 nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if \u2014 when we act together.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here today. We\u2019re going to continue to do it. And with the grace of God and the goodwill of all of you, we\u2019re going to be able to do it.\n\nMay God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n1:56 P.M. CDT",

Smith is prosecuting Trump in two separate federal cases, one involving Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and one involving his alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Both cases are still ongoing.\n\nTrump still faces charges in classified documents, election interference cases\n\nThe federal judges responsible have not brought an end to the two criminal cases brought against Trump as a result of Smith's investigations.\n\nTrump faces 40 counts in the classified documents case, including charges of obstructing justice, making false statements and trying to \"alter, destroy, mutilate or conceal evidence.\" More than 300 classified documents were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, over a year after he left the White House\n\nJudge Eileen Cannon is expected to postpone a May 20 trial date because of disputes in the case, and she has said it will probably be later than the prosecution's proposal of July 8. Trump\u2019s lawyers suggested Aug. 12, but also urged Cannon to postpone the trial until after the November election.\n\nFact check: Biden had nothing to do with Trump's indictment in classified documents probe\n\nTrump faces another four counts in the election interference case \u2013 three for conspiracy and one for obstruction. He is accused of falsely claiming election fraud and trying to overturn the legitimate 2020 election results.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan canceled a March 4 trial date as higher courts weigh Trump's claim that a former president is immune from prosecution for official acts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal and scheduled arguments for the week of April 22.\n\nIn the first comment, the social media user who made the post shared a link to an article published in January about Chutkan barring Smith from filing pretrial motions without permission as Trump's immunity claim is decided. Chutkan, though, rejected a request from Trump's team to hold Smith in contempt, NBC News reported.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the social media user who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Biden's administration has repeatedly criticized Israel's plans, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., publicly disavowed Netanyahu's leadership in a floor speech last week that drew condemnation from Republican leadership and Israeli officials.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he had a \"lengthy conversation\" with Netanyahu on Wednesday morning, but he did not confirm plans to invite him to give an address.\n\n\"We didn't talk about those logistics, but it's one of the things that we have in mind, and we may try to arrange for that,\" Johnson told reporters. \"I think it's very important for us to show solidarity and support with Israel right now in their time of great struggle. And we certainly stand for that position. We'll try to advance that in every way that we can.\"\n\nSCHUMER TRASHED FOR \u2018DISGUSTING\u2019 SPEECH CALLING ON ISRAEL TO DUMP NETANYAHU: \u2018OUTRAGEOUSLY INAPPROPRIATE\u2019\n\nRelations between the U.S. and Israel reached a low point last week when Schumer called for Israel to hold elections and remove Netanyahu from office.\n\nSCHUMER'S ANTI-NETANYAHU SPEECH STRENGTHENS BIBI IN ISRAEL'S WAR TO DEFEAT HAMAS\n\nThe majority leader said he believed that \" Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way by allowing his political survival to take the precedence over the best interests of Israel.\"\n\nNetanyahu responded in a Sunday appearance on \"Fox & Friends Weekend.\"\n\n\"I think Schumer's statements are wholly inappropriate. I think we're not a banana republic. The people of Israel will choose when they'll have elections, who they elect, and it's not something that will be foisted upon us,\" he said.\n\n\"Just imagine that, after 9/11, and when you're in the midst of fighting al Qaeda, and winning... some Israeli would say, \u2018Oh, the right thing to do is not to have new elections in America or have President Bush resign.\u2019 It's inappropriate. Shouldn't have been said. It's wrong,\" he added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA coalition of conservative groups organized by former Vice President Mike Pence's nonprofit, Advancing American Freedom, released a letter Wednesday similarly demanding Netanyahu be invited to speak.\n\n\"We respectfully request that you extend an invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress,\" the letter from the coalition addressed to Johnson states. \"The address would allow Prime Minister Netanyahu to directly update Congress and the American people on the ongoing war.\"\n\nSigners of the letter include Republican Jewish Coalition CEO Matt Brooks, Zionist Organization of America President Morton Klein, and Media Research Center founder L. Brent Bozell III.\n\nThe letter continues, \"It would help fact cut through fiction, as the media\u2019s attention on the Israel-Hamas war and the remaining hostages, particularly the five Americans still believed to be held hostage by Hamas, continues to fade.\"\n\nNetanyahu's office was not immediately available for comment.",

But, the officials said, Netanyahu was unmoved. The officials said the Biden administration is trying to lay the groundwork with other Israeli and civil society leaders in anticipation of an eventual post-Netanyahu government. In an attempt to work around Netanyahu, Blinken also met individually with members of his war Cabinet and other Israeli leaders, including opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid, officials said.\n\nBut Blinken faces two obstacles: one, that Israelis believe that they are, in fact, capable of winning the war, and that they are doing so; two, that Palestinians themselves do not want a state more than they want to destroy Israel, meaning a state is doomed to fail.\n\nOn the first point, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, delivered a comprehensive summary Wednesday night of the war\u2019s progress. While fighting in the southern portion of Gaza remains challenging, he said, the IDF had largely destroyed Hamas in the northern and central regions of the territory. The south is where Hamas\u2019s leaders are believed to be hiding underground \u2014 surrounded by over 100 Israeli hostages, whom they are using as bargaining chips and human shields.\n\nIsraelis are nearly unanimous in their determination to destroy Hamas \u2014 a dramatic shift in attitudes since the October 7 terror attack, when Israelis were largely prepared to ignore Hamas as long as it did not attack them. The mass murder of 1,200 people, along with the abduction of 253 more, mostly civilians, changed attitudes in Israel across the political spectrum.\n\nMany left-wing Israelis who once considered themselves \u201cmore Palestinian than the Palestinians\u201d now see all Palestinians as a potential threat.\n\nAccording to Gallup, nearly two-thirds of Israelis now oppose a Palestinian state, given what Hamas did to them, and to Gaza \u2014 and given the pro-terror sympathies of the corrupt Palestinian Authority, which governs most Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nThat is a radical reversal from the position of most Israelis just a decade ago, when \u201ctwice as many Israeli adults supported an independent Palestinian state (61%) as opposed one (30%).\u201d Hamas\u2019s rocket and terror attacks are responsible for the change.\n\nBlinken and President Joe Biden are committed to the old, failed model of Middle East peacemaking, in which the Palestinian issue must precede all others. President Donald Trump rejected that idea \u2014 and the result was the historic Abraham Accords.\n\nNow, Biden and Blinken are trying to make new peace agreements \u2014 such as a Saudi-Israeli peace deal \u2014 contingent on the creation of a Palestinian state. And Blinken is casting Israelis as if they are not ready for peace, in contrast to the Arab world.\n\nThat is a total inversion of the truth, according to opinion polls, which suggest that the vast majority of Palestinians support Hamas\u2019s terror attack of October 7. Arab public opinion is similar, though the Abraham Accords have remained intact so far.\n\nNBC News also reports that Blinken is pushing a deal in which Saudi Arabia would agree to normalized relations with Israel in return for a Palestinian state. Ironically, Saudi Arabia was on the verge of a deal without a Palestinian state before October 7.\n\nIt was the Biden administration, according to one report, that actually stalled that deal by insisting on additional concessions to the Palestinians \u2014 concessions that the Saudis did not demand and for which the Palestinians did not agree to any compromises.\n\nJoel B.

Instead, his former business partners will testify about the extent of now-President Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in Hunter\u2019s business affairs.\n\nThe hearing is titled: \u201cInfluence Peddling: Examing Joe Biden\u2019s Abuse of Public Office.\u201d\n\nAnd dodging it is just Hunter\u2019s latest dodge of responsibility.\n\nFrom skipping out on his first deposition to hold a pity party of a press conference on the Capitol steps (just out of reach of the House sergeant at arms), to using his personal failings as a sob story to garner sympathy with the establishment media, he\u2019s done almost everything short of owning up to his failings and admitting guilt.\n\nIncluding just getting up and walking out when someone he doesn\u2019t like starts questioning him.\n\nToo bad us normies can\u2019t do that when fielding uncomfortable questions during a trial.\n\nDo you believe Hunter Biden is corrupt?

Yes: 100% (18 Votes) No: 0% (0 Votes)\n\nWith the word that the younger Biden has rejected the opportunity to publicly testify, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on Tuesday trolled the president\u2019s son with video evidence of his cowardice from an oversight committee meeting back in January.\n\nHunter had dropped in on the meeting unannounced. But as Greene shared with the good folks on the social media platform X, Hunter Biden decided, that instead of letting her ask a single question, he was just going to up and leave.\n\nHunter Biden is afraid to face me at the Oversight Committee hearing tomorrow.

Marjorie Taylor Greene\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RepMTG) March 19, 2024\n\nAs seen in the video, right as Greene was about to ask Biden a question, he and his legal team got up and left the room, to the consternation of many at the meeting.\n\nGreene began, \u201cthank you Mr. Chairman,\u201d before noting Biden swiftly departing, calling after him \u201cexcuse me!\u201d, amid questions of \u201cwhere is he going?\u201d as he continued to ignore her.\n\nGreene then continued, telling him \u201capparently, Hunter, you\u2019re afraid of my words\u201d as he fled the room.\n\nShe then addressed her fellow representatives, saying that, \u201cI think it\u2019s clear and obvious that for everyone watching this hearing today that Hunter Biden is terrified of strong, conservative, Republican women. Because he can\u2019t even face my words as I was about to speak to him. What a coward.\u201d\n\nWhat a coward indeed.\n\nOf course, anyone who\u2019s been following Joe Biden\u2019s disaster of a younger son knew that already.\n\nAfter all, this is a man too afraid to even acknowledge his own illegitimate daughter until forced to by the courts.\n\nEven so, witnessing such a stark example of his blatant cowardice is disturbing. And even after two months, the scene in the oversight committee hearing is shocking.\n\nNow, Marjorie Taylor Greene is a bit infamous among conservative and liberal circles alike for running her mouth and making herself obnoxious, publicly saying uncomfortable things most politicians would rather remain cloaked in euphemisms and gentle language.\n\nHowever, sometimes her blunt, uncompromising style is just what the doctor ordered for the D.C. swamp.\n\nThe Biden administration has become notorious for a lack of transparency, especially regarding the younger Biden\u2019s controversial business decisions.\n\nIn this instance, Greene is absolutely right to call him out for his cowardice.\n\nAs one X user wrote: \u201cLike all in the Degenerate Party, the law doesn\u2019t apply to them \u2014 nothing will happen.\u201d\n\nLike all in the Degenerate Party, the law doesn\u2019t apply to them \u2014 nothing will happen. https://t.co/DCscB2VfYw \u2014 JW (@jtw372) March 19, 2024\n\nGranted, her abrasive personality ensured her comments and retweets were incredibly divided, but in this case, you can\u2019t argue that this makes Hunter Biden look pretty bad.\n\nAnother user shared an interesting insight, commenting \u201cthis is how someone with something to hide acts.\u201d\n\nthis is how someone with something to hide acts. https://t.co/H0yyLY0JNs \u2014 Mini Ghost\u2122 (@ghostofdark) March 19, 2024\n\nHunter Biden has an entire legion of skeletons in his closet.\n\nAnd we need more people like Greene to call him out on his cowardly evasions and escapes.\n\nHe might be the son of the president, but he can\u2019t run forever.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal.\n\nSubmit a Correction \u2192 * Name\n\n* Email\n\n* Message\n\n\n\n* All fields are required.

            "text": "While the anger was a bit misplaced, one can easily understand why liberals were furious that the now-deceased Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg didn\u2019t step down before the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nAfter all, the writing was on the wall. In the sixth year of Barack Obama in the White House, Americans had gotten fed up with the Democrats and the Senate was poised to change hands. If Republicans were to take control of the Senate, they would stall any nominee the then-president chose to fill a vacancy on the court.\n\nGinsburg was 81 at the time and had battled cancer. She was the liberal-appointed justice most likely to fall to tragedy, speaking in purely actuarial terms. In fact, she had made it to the age of 87 when she died in 2020.\n\nThat was when then-President Donald Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to replace her and she was confirmed by a GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nThe same can\u2019t be said for Merrick Garland, of course. In 2016, he was the man Obama was nominated to the court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of that year.\n\nGiven that the Republicans controlled the Senate, they were in no mood to confirm one of the administration\u2019s justices, particularly in an election year, and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to even give Garland a hearing. (Garland\u2019s nakedly partisan contempt for the rule of law as attorney general of the United States under President Joe Biden has revealed this course of action to have been a wise one.)\n\nHowever, the Democrats still have control of the White House and Senate. Whether that lasts is anyone\u2019s guess; Trump leads Biden in the polls and outlook for the upper chamber isn\u2019t superb for the Democrats even if they\u2019re able to keep control of 1600 Pennsylvania.\n\nThat\u2019s why generally lib-friendly writer Josh Barro \u2014 a politics and economics journo who tends to be very Biden-supportive on his Substack, even if he mostly remains nominally neutral \u2014 thinks it\u2019s high time the Dems pressured Sonia Sotomayor to retire.\n\nWait, you might be saying \u2014 isn\u2019t Sotomayor young, by the standards of the gerontocracy in Washington? At age 69, yes she is, even if she is (as Barro noted) \u201ca diabetic who has in some instances traveled with a medic.\u201d However, in a Substack post excerpted by lefty rag The Atlantic on Monday, Barro called out liberal \u201ccowardice in speaking up about Sotomayor\u201d and her age.\n\nIn 2006, Barro wrote, Scalia was 70 years old with 20 years of service on the court behind him. If he had retired then, then-President George W. Bush could nominate his replacement for confirmation by a Republican-controlled Senate. That would have kept Scalia\u2019s seat on the court safely in conservative hands, potentially for decades.\n\nBarro asked readers to \u201cimagine for a moment that Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 election, as many expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy running a few points stronger, she might have taken Democratic candidates across the finish line in close races in Pennsylvania and Missouri, resulting in Democratic control of the Senate,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIn that scenario, Clinton would have named a liberal successor to Scalia \u2014 more liberal than Garland \u2014 and conservatives would have lost control of the Court, all because of Scalia\u2019s failure to retire at the opportune moment.\u201d\n\nThis, mind you, is a scenario liberals believe they deserve anyway \u2014 and have been willing to back court-packing and similar schemes in order to achieve it. It didn\u2019t happen, and any scenario that involves keeping Missouri blue given the red drift in that state is a bit ludicrous. Nevertheless, Barro noted that Sotomayor is the oldest of the three liberal-appointed justices.\n\n\u201cJustice Sonia Sotomayor will turn 70 in June. If she retires this year, President Joe Biden will nominate a young and reliably liberal judge to replace her,\u201d Barro wrote.\n\n\u201cRepublicans do not control the Senate floor and cannot force the seat to be held open like they did when Scalia died. Confirmation of the new justice will be a slam dunk, and liberals will have successfully shored up one of their seats on the Court \u2014 playing the kind of defense that is smart and prudent when your only hope of controlling the Court again relies on both the timing of the death or retirement of conservative judges and not losing your grip on the three seats you already hold.\u201d\n\nAnd, if she doesn\u2019t retire this year, Barro wrote, \u201cwe don\u2019t know when she will next be able to retire with a likely liberal replacement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that Democrats will retain the presidency and the Senate in this year\u2019s elections, in which case the insurance created by a Sotomayor retirement won\u2019t have been necessary,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut if Democrats lose the presidency or the Senate this fall\u2014or both\u2014she\u2019ll need to stay on the bench until the party once again controls them. That could be just a few years, or it could be longer.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have previously had to wait as long as 14 years (1995 to 2009). In other words, if Sotomayor doesn\u2019t retire this year, she\u2019ll be making a bet that she will remain fit to serve until possibly age 78 or even 82 or 84 \u2014 and she\u2019ll be forcing the whole Democratic Party to make that high-stakes bet with her.\u201d\n\nYet, Democrats have reportedly been on the fence about replacing her with a younger justice because she\u2019s the first Latina woman on the court.\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly gutless,\u201d Barro wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about putting control of the Court completely out of reach for more than a generation, but because she is Latina, you can\u2019t hurry along an official who\u2019s putting your entire policy project at risk? If this is how the Democratic Party operates, it deserves to lose.\u201d [Emphasis his.]\n\nHe called this \u201cpart of a broader insanity in the way that the Democratic Party thinks about diversity and representation\u201d \u2014 which isn\u2019t necessarily a lie, but that\u2019s part of a much broader problem in American liberalism than he lets on.\n\n\u201cRepresentation is supposed to be important because the presence of different sorts of people in positions of power helps ensure that the interests and preferences of various communities are taken into account when making policy. But in practice, Democratic Party actions regarding diversity tend to be taken for the benefit of officials rather than demographic groups,\u201d Barro wrote. (Emphasis his. And by the way, duh.)\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more important for ordinary Latina women who support Democrats \u2014 that there not be one more vote against abortion rights on the Supreme Court, or that Sotomayor is personally there to write dissenting opinions? The answer is obvious, unless you work in Democratic politics for a living, in which case it apparently becomes a difficult call.\u201d\n\nThis should be a difficult call for a number of different reasons, albeit not the identitarian ones Barro says the Democrats are falling prey to. The biggest one is this: While justices on the Supreme Court have, in the past, skewed one way or another in terms of ideology depending on who nominated them, it\u2019s still supposed to be the one non-political branch of the federal government.\n\nWhile the politicization of the Supreme Court has taken many faces, both Democrat and Republican,a milestone was reached during the Obama years, when the then-president set a precedent by lecturing the Supreme Court on campaign finance law during the 2010 State of the Union. President Biden continued that tradition 14 years later, though only six of nine justices were there to hear it.\n\nSonia Sotomayor is mostly healthy and, by the standards of Washington, D.C., young. But, if having someone in her late 60s on the bench is too problematic for the Democrats, why stop there?\n\nElena Kagan, Obama\u2019s other appointee, is 63. Replace them both with fresh Harvard Law grads, I say, preferably those who skipped a few years back in high school. Make sure they haven\u2019t taken a gap year, of course, and have passed rigorous physicals. Check their family history for longevity, as well. Make sure that they\u2019ve got great-grandparents in their 90s still alive and kicking. Not that it matters, because they\u2019ll probably be asked to retire before the odometer hits the big 7-0, but you can never be too careful.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that Sotomayor is some kind of genius jurist who cannot be replaced, but Barro\u2019s reductio ad absurdum thought experiment demonstrates the issue with this.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that leftists are infuriated with the current Supreme Court majority simply because it follows the Constitution as written and not as a rubber stamp for social policy that fails at the legislative level. (Cough cough Roe v. Wade cough.)\n\nThey now want to disabuse whatever trust conservatives and independents might have in the court by just sewing up seats via trading out justices for other younger nominees.\n\nMoreover, if the nine men and women on the Supreme Court bench can easily be replaced by less-experienced lawyers simply for perceived actuarial benefits, it\u2019s essentially starting a political arms race to the bottom when it comes to judicial experience on the highest court in the land. Oh, you found a 45-year-old to replace Sonia Sotomayor? Well, here\u2019s a 35-year-old to replace Clarence Thomas! And a 29-year-old to take over for Alito! These would be people selected for their potential longevity, not on merit. If you want a surefire way to ruin the court, this is it.\n\nAnd, yes, Barro realizes the irony here: \u201cOne obvious response to this argument is that the president is also old \u2014 much older, indeed, than Sonia Sotomayor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am aware, and I consider this to be a serious problem. But Democrats are unlikely to find a way to replace Biden with a younger candidate who enhances their odds of winning the election.\u201d\n\nNor are they likely to find a way to replace Sotomayor that doesn\u2019t boil down to electoral cynicism. Sotomayor is a decade younger than Biden, still in relative good health and \u2014 this is the important thing \u2014 in compos mentis. If there\u2019s any way to seal the deal for Republicans who are Trump-averse to vote the GOP ticket this November, pressuring her not to pull an RBG (who was a decade olderand cancer survivor when there were calls for her to step aside in 2014) is pretty much it.\n\nThen again, maybe Barro is saying the quiet part out loud: The establishment media thinks Trump and the GOP may not even need something like that to win.\n\nAfter all, he\u2019s not the only one talking about Sotomayor\u2019s seat, as an article last week in Bloomberg Law pointed out.\n\nWhen The Atlantic is sounding the alarm so blatantly, there\u2019s a reason. The left is panicking and desperate to shove a minority woman off the court in order to shore up whatever support it has there. That ought to tell you a lot about how the establishment media thinks this race is going to play out. Trump may win and everyone has to make sacrifices \u2014 including Sonya Sotomayor.\n\nIf that sacrifice is Sotomayor giving up a Supreme Court seat, well, so be it.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal.",

            "text": "rewrite this content and keep HTML tags\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department will file a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\nThe long-anticipated lawsuit comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach to its hardware and software, in which Apple tightly controls how third-party tech companies can interact with the tech behemoth\u2019s products and services.\n\n\n\nFor example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message.\n\n\n\nThe company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors\u2019 products are far more limited in their capabilities.\n\n\n\nThis year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.\n\n\n\nAnd Apple maintains a large 30 per cent commission on most sales through its app store \u2013 a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple\u2019s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.\n\n\n\nYears of scrutiny\n\n\n\nApple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirrors the precision in which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.\n\n\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s landmark suit is expected to challenge a broad range of Apple\u2019s practices.\n\n\n\nThe case represents the Biden administration\u2019s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under US antitrust law. Apple is the only major tech company the federal government has yet to sue for alleged antitrust violations.\n\n\n\nApple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe legal action could weigh on Apple\u2019s stock price that currently values the company at just under US$3 trillion and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell less than one per cent Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.\n\n\n\nAlong with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.\n\n\n\nThis is a developing story and it will be updated.",

The total debt relief under PSLF is now $62.5 billion for 871,000 borrowers since October 2021.\n\nUnder the previous administration, only 2%, or around 7,000 PSLF borrowers, received forgiveness.\n\n\u201cFor too long, our nation\u2019s teachers, nurses, social workers, firefighters, and other public servants faced logistical troubles and trap doors when they tried to access the debt relief they were entitled to under the law,\u201d Miguel Cardona, US Secretary of Education, said in a press release. \u201cToday, more than 100 times more borrowers are eligible for PSLF than there were at the beginning of the administration.\u201d\n\nImpacted borrowers will receive an email from the Education Department notifying them of the discharge.\n\nThe White House also announced that an additional 380,000 PSLF borrowers will be notified that they are eligible for discharge within the next two years.

The AFT sued the Education Department in 2019 after more than 98% of borrowers who applied for the PSLF program were denied loan forgiveness when Betsy DeVos was US Education Secretary under the Trump administration.\n\nRead more: Student loan issues?

Another improvement for PSLF borrowers is the ability to digitally track the status of their applications in the \u201cMy Activity\u201d section of borrowers\u2019 StudentAid.gov account.\n\nTo date, the Biden administration has forgiven $143.6 billion in student loan debt for 3.96 million borrowers.\n\nIn addition to relief given to PSLF borrowers, 959,700 borrowers have received $47.3 billion in discharge through the SAVE income-driven repayment (IDR) plan and the one-time IDR adjustment; 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability received $11.7 billion in debt discharges; and over 1.3 million borrowers who were defrauded by their schools received $22.5 billion in discharges under the borrower defense discharge, according to the Education Department.\n\nRonda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Finance and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.

Kennedy Jr. filed their February disclosures with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Joe Biden Only one of President Biden\u2019s political committees reported on March 20, but that single body held far more cash at the end of February than any other major candidate\u2019s main committee.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s principal campaign committee, Biden For President, according to its FEC filing, held more than $71 million in cash on hand at the end of February.\n\nThe same organization raised about $21.3 million in total receipts and made about $6.3 million in total disbursements.\n\nSignificant parts of the Biden financial apparatus report on a quarterly basis, so the full extent of the president\u2019s fundraising is not clear as of March 20.\n\nHowever, Biden For President has issued press releases saying the campaign, as a whole, raised $53 million in February and has access to more than $155 million in cash.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s reelection effort was buoyed by a $120 million commitment from the progressive political group League of Conservation Voters on March 19, too.\n\nIn addition, on March 12, Republican Voters Against Trump pledged to spend $50 million in President Biden\u2019s favor. The group is financed by Democratic Party donors and Republican critics of President Trump.\n\nThe full size of President Biden\u2019s war chest will be known in April when the numerous committees tied to him file quarterly financial disclosures with the FEC. Donald Trump Three committees funding the Trump campaign raised about $28.7 million in February, according to the FEC.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s principal campaign committee, Donald J. Trump For President 2024 Inc., his qualified leadership political action committee, Save America, and a super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., held about $63.1 million at the end of February. The groups spent $22 million.\n\nFormer President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and former First Lady Melania Trump smile after voting in Florida's primary election at a polling station at the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach, Fla., on March 19, 2024.

President Trump is now the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee.\n\nPresident Trump scored another political victory in March when the Republican National Committee picked Michael Whatley and Lara Trump as its new co-chairs. The new leadership has promised to operate as an extension of the Trump campaign\n\nNevertheless, the Trump campaign is spending heavily on defending the candidate in numerous legal proceedings across the country.\n\nAccording to FEC filings, the three committees that reported their February activities dropped more than $6.5 million on legal expenses during the month.\n\nPresident Trump will likely continue to face legal and financial hurdles as the cases against him progress. He\u2019s currently staring down a $464 million bond in order to appeal a decision in New York.\n\nLike President Biden, only a portion of the Trump campaign\u2019s finances were revealed on March 20. The rest of the committees regulated by the FEC connected to President Trump will issue quarterly disclosures in the middle of April. Robert F.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Democratic Party has ramped up its attacks on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in recent days, marking the first significant attempt by either party to shape voter sentiment around his candidacy ahead of a potential rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has taken multiple steps in recent days to portray Kennedy as a spoiler who would help Republican frontrunner Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden, arguing Kennedy is funded primarily by wealthy donors aligned with the former president.\n\nLast week, the DNC filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Kennedy\u2019s campaign had illegally coordinated with American Values 2024, a PAC backing his White House bid. Kennedy\u2019s campaign has denied coordinating with the group.\n\nIn a call with reporters outlining the complaint, DNC adviser Ramsey Reid blamed Trump and his donors for turning Kennedy into a \u201cstalking horse\u201d by funding the PAC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that Donald Trump is disrespecting the democratic process. It\u2019s pretty clear that Trump and his megadonors are propping up RFK Jr. as a stalking horse,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe DNC has homed in on donations to the PAC from billionaire Tim Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking fortune who has been a prolific donor to pro-Trump and other GOP causes over the years. Mellon gave approximately $15 million to American Values 2024 last year. In 2020, he gave $20 million to America First Action Inc., one of the leading outside groups backing Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nOn Saturday, as Kennedy held a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the DNC advertised on four billboards around the area accusing Kennedy of being \u201cpowered by MAGA/Trump.\u201d And after the Kennedy-aligned PAC released a new TV ad during the Super Bowl that repurposed an old spot from the 1960 campaign of President John F. Kennedy, the candidate\u2019s uncle, the DNC issued a statement highlighting the PAC\u2019s funding from Mellon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump\u2019s largest donor this cycle,\u201d DNC rapid response director Alex Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the ad aired Sunday.\n\nKennedy\u2019s team pushed back on the Democratic attacks, saying that donors \u201cfrom across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,\u201d Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDNC adviser Lis Smith told CNN the party\u2019s latest efforts are meant to educate voters on the connections between Trump and Kennedy, while acknowledging the critical role Kennedy could play in the general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Donald Trump and his allies view him as a useful stalking horse who could help throw the election to Trump in November,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile his independent campaign faces steep odds of success, Kennedy\u2019s candidacy could influence the outcome of a Biden-Trump rematch if he garners enough support in critical states. In the 2020 election, Biden flipped three states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin \u2013 by margins of less than 1%. Recent national polling of a Trump-Biden rematch suggests the race could be narrowly decided again. A CNN/SSRS poll released earlier this month showed Trump with 49% support among registered voters, compared with 45% for Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear as of now how Kennedy would affect a potential general election between Biden and Trump \u2013 whether he\u2019d draw more support from historically Republican or Democratic voters, or whether he\u2019d receive enough total support to influence the election either way. An NBC News poll released this month found 34% of registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s allies have targeted Biden and Democrats as they look to gain traction in the race, a sign they\u2019re ready to meet the DNC\u2019s escalating attacks straight ahead. In a statement released after the Super Bowl ad, American Values 2024 co-founder Mark Gorton criticized the DNC for its efforts targeting Kennedy.\n\n\u201cThe only argument the DNC has left is that Biden is not Trump. When RFK Jr. gets on the ballot, the American public will have the ability to choose a candidate who is not Trump, who has integrity, bravery, a proven track record of fighting corporate corruption, and the ability to stand up to the corporate interests that have taken over the Biden administration. The American people are waking up, and the DNC\u2019s only hope is to prevent them from having a choice,\u201d Gorton said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and David Wright contributed to this report.",

According to the constitution, which he re-wrote to his benefit in 2020, he then could stand again for a further six-year term.\n\nAcademic rigour, journalistic flair\n\nTHE CONVERSATION....\n\nBULLSHIT WITH RIGOUR AND JOURNALISTIC BIAS... CAPS ARE COMMENTS BY GUS....\n\nThe West can\u2019t \u2018solve\u2019 its Russia problem. Here\u2019s how it should handle 6 more years of Vladimir Putin\n\nTHE WEST DOES NOT HAVE A RUSSIA PROBLEM... RUSSIA HAS A WEST PROBLEM: THE WEST HAS BEEN DECEITFUL, WARMONGERING \u2014 AND SECRETLY WANTS TO DESTROY RUSSIA.\n\nBY Peter Tesch\n\nWHY NOT 6 MORE YEARS OF PRESIDENT PUTIN?\n\nTo put that in perspective, Putin already has ruled Russia as president or prime minister for 24 years, or the equivalent of eight Australian parliamentary terms. In that period, Australia has had eight prime ministers and changed governing party three times. The United States has had five different presidents; the United Kingdom seven different prime ministers.\n\nIn contrast to elections in the West, where the outcomes are genuinely in the hands of the voters [AHAHAHA] and adjudicated by independent electoral commissions, Russia is different. As the former UK ambassador to Moscow, Laurie Bristow, wrote:\n\nIn Russia, the purpose of elections is to validate the decisions of its rulers, not to discover the will of the people.\n\nIN THE WEST, THE PURPOSE OF ELECTIONS IS TO DECEIVE THE PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING THEY HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN \"TWEEDUMDLE AND TWEEDUMDEE\"\u2026 WHILE THE PENTAGON IS RULING THE ROOST\u2026\n\nPETER TESCH CONTINUES:\n\nPutin\u2019s jaded view of the West\n\nPutin now will appoint a new government. His picks will be intensely scrutinised for clues to a succession plan and future policies. Although he is a master of surprise, we should not count on Putin leaving any time soon. Only four leaders of modern Russia and the USSR have left the top job alive; the rest have died in office of natural or other causes. SO?\n\nMoreover, Putin\u2019s actions over the past two years have been directed at moving Russia from authoritarianism to semi-totalitarianism. The Carnegie Endowment\u2019s Andrei Kolesnikov has written persuasively of these tectonic shifts that recall the darkest years of Soviet Stalinism.\n\nPutin has explicitly presented his war of choice in Ukraine as a proxy for a wider, long-term conflict with the West. He believes the West is irresolute, in decline, and easily distracted and deflected. PUTIN IS TOTALLY CORRECT.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chave at them\u201d attitude towards US allies and partners, and the woeful Western vacillation over further military aid to Ukraine, will only embolden Putin further. Buoyed by his ritual success in this weekend\u2019s election, he will embark on further risky and provocative adventurism. HE WON\u2019T. PUTIN DOES NOT WANT MORE TROUBLES. THE WEST DOES.\n\nRead more: What can we expect from six more years of Vladimir Putin? An increasingly weak and dysfunctional Russia\n\nBULLSHIT. WEAK AND DYSFUNCTIONAL? THE WEST IS IN A FAR MORE WEAK AND DYSFUNCTIONAL SITUATION.\n\nConsequently, Putin \u2013 and the ideology of \u201cPutinism\u201d \u2013 pose a serious challenge for Western governments and policymakers who are genuinely accountable to their electorates, [DO YOU THINK VON DER LEYEN, THIS UNELECTED WITCH OF EUROPE IS ACCOUNTABLE?] the party room, the parliamentary opposition, a vocal and inquisitorial media [DO YOU THINK THE WESTERN MEDIA ASKS QUESTIONS OF ITS OWN RULERS?]and an independent judiciary [LIKE THE INQUISITION AGAINST TRUMP IN THE USA?].\n\nAs exiled Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar has argued, part of Putin\u2019s statecraft is directed at making common cause with ultra-conservative Western political elements to contest global \u201cwokeness\u201d, demobilise support for [NAZI] Ukraine, and dull resistance to Russian territorial ambitions in its neighbourhood. PUTIN ONY HAS TERRITORIAL \u201cAMBITIONS\u201d TO TERRITORIES THAT WERE UNDER RUSSIAN CONTROL AND POPULATED BY RUSSIANS WHO BEG TO REJOIN RUSSIA\u2026 FAIR ENOUGH.\n\nHow democratic governments need to respond\n\nPutin is well aware that the inherent fractiousness of democracy and the need to court the fickle voters hobbles democratic governments\u2019 long-term planning. THE WEST IS AS DEMOCRATIC AS A DUNNY IS USEFUL ON THE MOON.\n\nMoreover, our political culture is predisposed to wanting to \u201csolve\u201d issues. MOST OF THE TIMES, THE WEST DOES NOT SOLVE ANYTHING BUT CREATES MORE PROBLEMS. Sometimes, though, problems of the scale posed by Russia or the Middle East can only be managed, not solved \u2013 and then only through joint efforts with like-minded allies and partners. That requires persistence and resilience to rise above short-term politicking and the twitches of our \u201cinstant expert\u201d social media culture. YES WE ARE EXPEDIENT AND BULLSHIT ABOUT OUR ABILITY OF \u201cEXPERTISE\u201d\u2026.\n\nIt also demands constant investment in building and sustaining public understanding of what really is at stake, beyond the borders of Europe that were drawn in the bloodshed and misery of the second world war. DOES THIS MEANS THAT THE WEST NEED TO TUNE THE STUPID PROPAGANDA TO 11? UKRAINE WAS ARTIFICIALLY DRAWN BY THE USSR...\n\nThis is difficult anywhere, not least in the West, where we have had it comparatively easy for most of the post-second world war era. [DID WE HAVE GOOD LEADERS THEN?] We need stalwart and principled leadership now more than at any other point in the last 50 years. Most of all, we need ongoing serious and informed public conversations [YES! WE LITTLE BOURGEOIS ENJOY THE SPOILS OF FOREVER WARS] about what we value in and wish for in democratic societies, and the price we are willing to pay to attain and preserve that. WE DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR VALUES, BUT ACCEPT THAT RUSSIA HAS ITS OWN VALUES AND DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE OVER OTHER LANDS \u2014 EXCEPT THE DONBASS REGION, AS WARNED BY PUTIN SINCE AT LEAST SINCE 2008, TO PREVENT NATO ILLEGALLY \u201cINVADING\u201d UKRAINE.\n\nRead more: Why the US and its partners cannot afford to go soft on support for Ukraine now\n\nBULLSHIT. MAKING A PROPER DEAL ISN\u2019T GOING SOFT, BUT RECOGNISING THAT UKRAINE 1991 IS NOT AN INTEGRAL COUNTRY\u2026 THE DONBASS WAS RUSSIAN AND IS NOW BECOMING RUSSIAN AGAIN.\n\nThat sort of discourse can be hard to generate in our politically rather apathetic society. However, it is vital when the institutions of our democracy are barraged by foreign information manipulation and interference designed to sow doubt and distrust and corrode popular faith in the integrity of our form of government. WE BULLSHIT FAR MORE THAN THE RUSSIANS WHO HAVE STUCK TO THE NARRATIVE SINCE AT LEAST 2014 IN REGARD TO UKRAINE.\n\nEspecially in Australia, we have allowed our already limited pool of Russia expertise to atrophy to near-extinction. It is well past time to re-invest, modestly but purposefully, in Russian language and associated studies at our universities. We need to boost \u201cRussia literacy\u201d and comprehension of a country that will remain a significant and disruptive player in the world. This matters to countries that matter to us. GREAT IDEA! YOU NEVER KNOW, WE MIGHT EVEN UNDERSTAND RUSSIA LIKE SCOTT RITTER DOES\u2026.\n\nWe should also honestly and critically assess the mistaken assumptions and indifference that at times have undermined effective Western policies towards post-Soviet Russia. However, we should not succumb to the propaganda peddled by Putin and his proteges abroad that Moscow is a blameless victim of Western perfidy and deception aimed at destroying the Russian state. THE WESTERN PERFIDY CANNOT BE GAUGED BY THE WEST, BECAUSE IT ORIGINATES FROM THE WEST.\n\nRather, as Australian professor Mark Edele writes in his recent book, Russia\u2019s War Against Ukraine:\n\nRussia never came to terms \u2013 either as a society or as a polity \u2013 with its transformation from a continental empire with global reach into a nation-state and a regional power. professor Mark Edele WROTE SHIT. The Kremlin is marketing Russia as an ally of \u201cthe Global South\u201d in resisting resurgent neo-colonialism and championing \u201cmultipolarity\u201d.\n\nWE HATE MULTIPOLARITY IN THE WEST BECAUSE IT CHALLENGES OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO DOMINATE (COLONISE) THE WORLD WITH AN ENGLISH/AMERICAN/JEWISH HEGEMONY\u2026\n\nThe Putin thesis is that Ukraine is a patsy of London and Washington, while Moscow is on the side of the formerly colonised. PUTIN IS CORRECT: WASHINGTON HAS CULTIVATED UKRAINE TO WEAKEN RUSSIA (THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION OWN WORDS). That argument is finding some ready ears, evident in the patchy support for sanctions on Russia [IT\u2019S NOT PATCHY \u2014 OUT OF 190 COUNTRIES OR SO IN THE WORLD, ONLY 15 OR SO ARE IN FAVOUR OF SANCTIONS,. We cannot assume our own Indo-Pacific region is persuaded of the wrongness of the Kremlin\u2019s claims. THE KREMLIN\u2019S CLAIMS ARE CORRECT.\n\nThe reality confronting us is that of a sullen and resentful Russia [NO, NOT SULLEN NOR RESENTFUL, \u2014 BUT CONFIDENT AND POSITIVE], convinced that history, morality and even divinity is on its side in a de facto existential war with the West. RUSSIA DOES NOT WANT WAR WITH THE WEST. RUSSIA HAS WANTED TO COOPERATE WITH THE WEST, BUT THE WEST REJECTED RUSSIA\u2026\n\nMoreover, as Bristow, my former colleague in Moscow, has written:\n\nwe would be unwise to assume that a rising generation of Russians will embrace a more democratic and pro-Western outlook.\n\nPRO-WESTERN OUTLOOK MEANS BUM-FIGHTS, RAMPANT ECONOMIC DOWNGRADE, SILLY LIES FROM ONE OR THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES, CORRUPTION WORSE THAN IN UKRAINE AND DELUSIONS OF GRANDEURS LONG VANISHED. NAPOLEON IS DEAD.\n\nYet, we must not turn away from those Russians \u2013 far from an irrelevant minority \u2013 who do not share Putin\u2019s view that the future of their country lies in the perceived glories of its past. The challenge is to articulate what a better future would look like for Russia, beyond confrontation, and to keep that alternative clearly in view.\n\nDO YOU MEAN THAT THE WEST SHOULD POLITICALLY INTERFERE INSIDE RUSSIA? WOW!!!!!!\n\nPACK YOUR BAG, \u201cTHE CONVERSATION\u201d\u2026.\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-west-cant-solve-its-russia-problem-heres-how-it-should-handle-6-more-years-of-vladimir-putin-225999\n\nFREE JULIAN ASSANGE NOW....",

            "text": "Will the Biden Impeachment Inquiry Bear Fruit Today?\n\nMarch 20, 2024 | Tags: LIBERTY DAILY\n\nDepending on who you ask, today is either the beginning of the end for the Biden Crime Family\u2019s influence peddling business or it\u2019s Kabuki Theater for Republicans to pretend they\u2019re finally getting tough with Hunter Biden, Uncle James, and Daddy Joe.\n\nWitnesses will be trotted out before the House Oversight Committee. These witnesses will support the contention by House Republicans that the Biden Crime Family got paid for doing nothing other than dishing out political favors from then-VP Joe Biden. It will be crystal clear to anyone who\u2019s paying attention that Joe was the product the family was selling. Hunter, James, and their cohorts offered nothing else of value in exchange for a whole lot of money from the highest bidders.\n\nUnfortunately, this will likely bear no real fruit other than score some political points in an election year. That\u2019s it. Neither Hunter nor James are going to jail. The man in the Oval Office will not be removed until either voters take him out in November or Barack Obama replaces him with another puppet before the election.\n\nConservative media will be aflutter. Corporate media will be bouncing back and forth between debunking and ignoring claims by witnesses and Committee members. Social media will trade clips of \u201cbombshells.\u201d But at the end of the day, nothing of substance will happen.\n\nSuch is the way in Washington DC. Depending on who\u2019s in power at the time, Democrats will either act to destroy the nation or Republicans will talk about taking action after the upcoming election. They always delay until the next election. That\u2019s the UniParty Swamp.\n\nHere\u2019s the writeup of Wednesday\u2019s happenings generated from corporate media reports\u2026.\n\nIn a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d development, former business associates of Hunter Biden are set to testify publicly on Capitol Hill this Wednesday. This marks the beginning of the next phase in the impeachment inquiry against President Biden, as congressional Republicans take the lead.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer is expected to open the hearing by shedding light on a year-long investigation that has unearthed no credible evidence of the Bidens providing any work product. Furthermore, investigators have not identified any legitimate value or documents to support the Bidens\u2019 business partnerships.\n\nComer will emphasize that the Bidens\u2019 work methodology deviates from traditional norms. They do not function as consultants, lawyers, or advisors; nor do they sell products, services, or skill sets. Instead, the Bidens\u2019 primary asset is Joe Biden himself.\n\nComer will assert that Joe Biden has consistently taken actions to further his family\u2019s wealth accumulation. He will describe the alleged scam as a simple one: the Bidens promise to resolve foreign partners\u2019 issues by leveraging the U.S. government. This process has been repeated multiple times, with Joe Biden\u2019s power being invoked, subsequently resulting in millions of dollars flowing into the Bidens\u2019 pockets.\n\nTony Bobulinski, a U.S. Navy veteran, will testify publicly during a joint hearing of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees on Wednesday morning. Jason Galanis, serving a 14-year prison sentence for securities fraud, will also provide testimony, albeit virtually from a minimum-security prison in Alabama.\n\nDemocrats have invited Lev Parnas, a former associate of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, to testify publicly as well.\n\nComer, in announcing the hearing earlier this month, extended an invitation to Hunter Biden to testify publicly, fulfilling the first son\u2019s repeated requests. However, through his attorney, Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden rejected the invitation, dismissing the hearing as a \u201ccarnival side show.\u201d\n\nComer also invited Hunter Biden\u2019s former associate, Devon Archer, who is not expected to attend. Comer claims to have \u201ccalled Hunter Biden\u2019s bluff\u201d by offering a public hearing after the committee had deposed him, as per standard procedure for all witnesses.\n\nDuring Hunter Biden\u2019s deposition last month, he maintained that his father was never involved in or benefited from his business dealings. The committee also heard testimony from James Biden, the president\u2019s younger brother, who shared the same sentiment.\n\nHunter Biden did admit to putting his father on speakerphone with business associates and inviting him to business lunches. Archer had previously testified that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone at least 20 times with business associates.\n\nWithout Hunter and Archer, the hearing will feature Bobulinski, who worked with Hunter Biden to create SinoHawk Holdings, a joint venture with Chinese energy company CEFC. Bobulinski testified behind closed doors that he personally met with Joe Biden for more than 45 minutes in 2017.\n\nBobulinski also testified that Joe Biden \u201cenabled\u201d his son Hunter to sell access to the U.S.\u2019s \u201cmost dangerous adversaries,\u201d including the Chinese Communist Party, Russia, and others.\n\nGalanis\u2019 testimony will also focus on whether Joe Biden was involved in the businesses he worked on with Hunter Biden. Galanis, who was interviewed by congressional investigators last month, testified that Joe Biden was considering joining the board of a joint venture created by Hunter Biden and his business associates with ties to the Chinese Communist Party after he left the vice presidency.\n\nGalanis also mentioned that the phrase \u201clean in\u201d was used by Devon and Hunter Biden to signify access to Vice President Biden\u2019s political influence.\n\nDemocrats have criticized the impeachment investigation as \u201chopeless,\u201d with Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, stating that it originated from lies told by an indicted liar in close proximity to Russian agents.\n\nIt\u2019s always the Russians.\n\nThe post Will the Biden Impeachment Inquiry Bear Fruit Today? appeared first on \ud83d\udd14 The Liberty Daily.\n\n\n\nRead More...",

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nThe Senate voted Thursday afternoon in favor of passing a bill reversing the Biden administration's recent actions allowing beef imports from Paraguay, which has a history of cattle-borne illness.\n\nIn a 70-25 vote, the Senate approved the Congressional Review Act resolution, rendering it veto-proof. Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Mike Rounds, R-S.D., introduced the bipartisan resolution in February, which has been widely endorsed by cattle and farm industry groups, arguing that the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) actions could have negative consequences on the U.S. food supply.\n\n\"President Biden butchered this decision,\" Tester said in a statement after the bill passed. \"By cutting corners to resume beef imports from a country with a recent history of foot-and-mouth disease, the Biden Administration is jeopardizing our food supply and giving Montana consumers and producers a raw deal.\"\n\n\"We cannot allow beef imports from Paraguay until we have data that shows they are meeting the same high animal health standards as American ranchers, and I\u2019m proud to have secured bipartisan support in the Senate to force the Biden administration to reverse course.\"\n\nGOP REP INTRODUCES RESOLUTION CONDEMNING UN FOR CALLING ON AMERICANS TO STOP EATING MEAT\n\nIn November, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service finalized regulations allowing Paraguayan beef imports and issued a series of conditions that importers must meet to ensure that livestock diseases are not present in shipped products. The agency then began implementation of the rules one month later, despite criticism from lawmakers and U.S. industry groups.\n\nParaguay's livestock industry, though, has a history of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which spreads quickly among livestock and could severely threaten the U.S. economy . As a result, beef imports from the South American nation have been barred in the U.S. for years.\n\nLOCAL RESIDENTS EXPLODE AT BIDEN OFFICIALS OVER PLAN TO RELEASE GRIZZLY BEARS NEAR THEIR COMMUNITIES\n\n\"South Dakota is known for having high quality beef produced by hard-working farmers and ranchers across the state,\" said Rounds. \"We have very high standards regarding the quality of our beef. Unfortunately, Paraguay does not have the same history of enforcing health and safety standards that we do. Our inspectors haven\u2019t been to Paraguay in ten years.\"\n\nUSDA's actions came after a push from Paraguayan officials who argued that the industry was vital for the nation and that the country's government had taken steps to ensure the health of its cattle.\n\nAccording to a readout of a September meeting between the Paraguayan government and the White House Office of the United States Trade Representative , the two sides discussed the process of authorization. Paraguayan officials expressed their desire to resume raw beef product trade \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nParaguayan cattle industry associations and government agencies, including the Embassy of Paraguay to the U.S., submitted comments in May 2023 in response to the proposed version of the regulations finalized last year. The comments similarly urged the USDA to immediately allow beef imports.\n\nBIDEN ADMIN BACKS OFF PROTECTIONS FOR APEX PREDATOR, ANGERING ENVIRONMENTALISTS\n\n\"The Government of Paraguay and its diplomatic representation here in Washington are more than open to providing additional assurances regarding our compliance with the United States' safety standards,\" a spokesperson for the Embassy of Paraguay told Fox News Digital in a statement.\n\n\"We believe that the meat industries of our two countries have a lot of potential for opportunities and collaboration, especially in the exchange of knowledge in cattle breeding, herd management, sustainable practices, and trade and investment.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said that USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service agents conducted two on-site audits in Paraguay in December 2021 and June 2022. And they said that the nation has demonstrated its capability to comply with U.S. standards and regulations.\n\nThe White House issued a statement disapproving the resolution, saying it would \"mark a significant setback in the United States-Paraguay bilateral relationship and U.S. credibility as a reliable economic partner across Latin America.\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association (NCBA), U.S. Cattlemen\u2019s Association, Livestock Marketing Association, R-CALF USA, National Farmers Union, Montana Farmers Union, Montana Stockgrowers Association and Montana Farm Bureau Federation all praised the Senate's passage of the resolution.\n\n\"Given Paraguay\u2019s long history of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, it is simply too risky to allow Paraguayan imports without recent site visits to confirm Paraguay\u2019s safety claims,\" said NCBA Executive Director of Government Affairs Kent Baucus. \"U.S. cattle producers are thankful for the leadership of Senators Jon Tester and Mike Rounds for applying the Congressional Review Act to hold USDA accountable and protect our nation\u2019s cattle herd.\"",

            "text": "Republican opposition continued to grow Tuesday against a $118 billion bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package ahead of a key vote in the Senate.\n\nThe bill is now on track to fail, as GOP infighting threatens to steamroll any congressional response to the border as well put aid to Ukraine and Israel in jeopardy.\n\nDespite containing policy aimed at toughening border restrictions pushed for by conservatives, the deal has faced relentless attacks from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who has said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber - if it ever makes it out of the Senate. Trump, who is hoping to make immigration a key plank of his presidential campaign, has suggested on Truth Social that approving additional resources for the border would make Republicans \u201clook bad.\u201d\n\nOffering a blunt assessment of the grim prospects facing the bill, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that the deal \u201cwill not become law,\u201d due to Johnson\u2019s opposition and concerns within the Senate GOP conference.\n\n\u201cWe had a very robust discussion about whether or not this product could ever become law, and it\u2019s been made pretty clear to us by the speaker that it will not become law,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo high-ranking members of Senate GOP leadership \u2013 John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, and John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican \u2013 announced that they will vote against the measure in an initial procedural vote on Wednesday, the latest blow to a deal that was negotiated by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the most conservative senators, along with Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n\nA majority of Senate Republicans are now either actively planning to vote \u201cno\u201d during the first procedural vote on the package Wednesday or leaning against the bill. Many Republicans have attacked the policy directly, and some have argued there should be more time to consider, debate and amend the bill after it was released on Sunday evening.\n\nThune, the Senate GOP whip, said that he plans to vote against proceeding to the bill on Wednesday and said that blocking the package will be the \u201cpredominate position\u201d of GOP senators. Later in the day, Thune said, \u201cI would expect that the motion to proceed to the bill will fail.\u201d\n\nBarrasso, the chairman of the Senate GOP Conference, said in a statement, \u201cI cannot vote for this bill. Americans will turn to the upcoming election to end the border crisis.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer harshly criticized Senate Republicans on Tuesday for deciding to oppose the package as it is currently written, accusing them of acting on Trump\u2019s marching orders.\n\n\u201cWe all know what\u2019s going on here. Donald Trump would rather keep the chaos at the border so he can exploit it on the campaign trail, instead of letting the Senate do the right thing and fix it. He would rather let Ukraine suffer on the battlefield, instead of being tough on Putin,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd instead of standing up to Donald Trump, Senate Republicans are ready to kill our best chance at fixing the border and ready to vote down this aid package for Ukraine in order to put what they think \u2013 they think \u2013 is their party\u2019s political interest above the interests of the country.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leader also went after Republican demands for more time to read the bill, noting that they had requested 72 hours, and saying he would offer to move the first procedural vote to Thursday if they want another day. \u201cI suspect they won\u2019t accept even that offer, because they really don\u2019t want more time. They\u2019re just using it as an excuse,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, another prominent senior Republican, said he plans to vote no on moving forward with the deal, adding that he wants to see changes to parts of the bill.\n\n\u201cWe need more time,\u201d Cornyn told CNN, adding later: \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 on the motion to proceed.\u201d\n\nMurphy, a key Democratic border deal negotiator, blasted Senate Republicans on Tuesday, calling them a \u201cdisaster\u201d and describing their treatment of Lankford, the top GOP negotiator, as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d saying he never expected they would leave him \u201changing out to dry as badly as they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never expected they would leave Senator Lankford hanging out to dry as badly as they did,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI thought they would be able to find the votes to support a very tough, conservative compromise that he was able to win.\u201d\n\nLankford said on Tuesday that he has been \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his colleagues who he says are mischaracterizing the package in order to reject it, rather than what is actually in the bill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s disappointing to me, is to say if you\u2019re going to disagree with it, disagree with it based on the facts of the bill, not something that\u2019s actually factually not true,\u201d he said, pointing to accusations that the package includes amnesty, allows thousands more migrants to enter the US, and incentivizes more people to cross the border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the misinformation that\u2019s out there, and how effective that has been,\u201d added Lankford.\n\nHe acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s not looking good\u201d for the package to eventually become law, as more GOP senators demand more time to consider the language or reject it outright.\n\nOn Tuesday, McConnell said, \u201cI want to congratulate Senator Lankford on a remarkable job of negotiating with the other side, getting the support of the border council, but it looks to me and to most of our members is that we have no real chance here to make a law.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and other Republicans have attacked the bill as too weak, it would mark a tough change to immigration law and would give the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board called the deal \u201cthe most restrictive migrant legislation in decades,\u201d saying \u201cits provisions include long-time GOP priorities\u201d in an op-ed titled \u201cA Border Security Bill Worth Passing.\u201d\n\nThe sweeping legislative package would also provide aid to key US allies abroad, including billions of dollars to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine.\n\nIt is unclear if Congress will be able to pass aid to Ukraine and Israel separate from border measures as many Republican senators had previously demanded that the issues be paired together.\n\nAsked if Congress should drop the border elements of the package and pass the rest of the security supplemental for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Cornyn indicated he supported that approach.\n\n\u201cI would say defer the border and do the rest,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is pushing to pass a stand-alone Israel aid package on Tuesday, but that is also on the brink of collapse amid opposition from far-right Republicans and Democratic leaders, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nPresident Joe Biden would veto a House standalone aid package for Israel, the White House said Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Administration spent months working with a bipartisan group of Senators to reach a national security agreement that secures the border and provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel, while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by conflicts around the world,\u201d the White House wrote in a statement. \u201cInstead of working in good faith to address the most pressing national security challenges, this bill is another cynical political maneuver.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "text": "Share To Your Social Network\n\n(Missouri Independent) \u2013 Congress released the final six government funding bills early Thursday, starting off a sprint toward the Friday midnight deadline to wrap up work that was supposed to be finished nearly six months ago.\n\nThe bipartisan agreement on the $1.2 trillion spending package, which emerged just before 3 a.m., came less than two weeks after the U.S. House and Senate approved the other six annual appropriations bills.\n\nThis package includes the spending measures for some of the most crucial functions of the federal government \u2014 the departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, State, and Treasury.\n\nThe bill would also fund Congress, the Executive Office of the President, the judiciary, and the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe 1,012-page spending package provides money for hundreds of programs, including many that lawmakers will tout on the campaign trail heading toward the November elections. Included:\n\nU.S. troops and civilian Defense Department employees will receive a 5.2% pay raise retroactive to Jan. 1, 2024.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s new headquarters project \u2014 which has not only divided Democrats and Republicans, but the congressional delegations from Virginia and Maryland \u2014 will receive $200 million for construction on the Greenbelt, Maryland, site via the General Services Administration.\n\nStates will get $55 million in new Election Security Grant funding.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection as well as Immigrations and Customs Enforcement will get more than $4 billion in funding increases.\n\nChildcare and early learning programs at the Department of Health and Human Services will receive a $1 billion increase in funding. The boost will go toward the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which provides grants to state, territorial and tribal agencies, and Head Start, which provides funding to local grantees.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police will receive a 7.8% funding increase.\n\nAfghans who assisted the United States during the war would be eligible for an additional 12,000 Special Immigrant Visas.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, the primary aid organization in Gaza, would be stripped of U.S. funding after Israel accused agency employees of taking part in the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nWeekend work possible\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday morning the package clears \u201canother hurdle towards our ultimate goal of funding the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis funding agreement between the White House and Congressional leaders is good news that comes in the nick of time: When passed it will extinguish any more shutdown threats for the rest of the fiscal year, it will avoid the scythe of budget sequestration and it will keep the government open without cuts or poison pill riders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now the job of the House Republican leadership to move this package ASAP.\u201d\n\nAfter the House votes to approve the package, likely Friday, Schumer said, \u201cThe Senate will need bipartisan cooperation to pass it before Friday\u2019s deadline and avoid a shutdown.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday during a press conference he expected senators would be in session this weekend to take final votes on the package.\n\n\u201cMy assumptions and what I\u2019ve told our members is we\u2019re likely to be here this weekend. That will be determined, however, by how long it stays in the House,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n\u201cAnd when it\u2019s over here, what we have recently done \u2014 and I think hopefully will work again \u2014 is that in return for a certain number of amendments, we can finish it quicker, hopefully, than putting us in the position of shutting down the government,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said in a written statement the package would claw back $20.2 billion from the Internal Revenue Service funding that Democrats included in their signature climate change and tax package and $6 billion in unused COVID-19 funds.\n\nOn immigration, the funding package \u201ccuts funding to NGOs that incentivize illegal immigration and increases detention capacity and the number of Border Patrol Agents to match levels in the House-passed appropriations bill and the Secure the Border Act (H.R. 2),\u201d he said, referring to non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe package also includes funding for the nation\u2019s defense. \u201cThis FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission while expanding support for our brave men and women who serve in uniform,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cImportantly, it halts funding for the United Nations agency which employed terrorists who participated in the October 7 attacks against Israel.\u201d\n\nMore than $1B to reduce childcare costs\n\nSenate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said in a written statement that she was \u201cproud to have secured $1 billion more to lower families\u2019 child care costs and help them find pre-K \u2014 a critical investment to help tackle the child care crisis that is holding families and our economy back.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom day one of this process, I said there would be no extreme, far-right riders to restrict women\u2019s reproductive freedoms \u2014 and there aren\u2019t,\u201d Murray said. \u201cDemocrats stood firm to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose in these negotiations and focused on delivering investments that matter to working people.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, Murray said, \u201cdefeated outlandish cuts that would have been a gut punch for American families and our economy \u2014 and we fought off scores of extreme policies that would have restricted Americans\u2019 fundamental freedoms, hurt consumers while giving giant corporations an unfair advantage, and turned back the clock on historic climate action.\u201d\n\nThe House and Senate must debate and approve the measure in less than two days under the stopgap funding agreement, otherwise a weekend funding lapse would begin. If it went on beyond the brief period of the weekend, a partial government shutdown would begin.\n\nThe House can easily hold a vote within that timeline, but the Senate will need to reach agreement among all 100 of its members in order to avoid casting votes past that benchmark.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at where Congress increased funding and where it cut spending on these six government funding bills for fiscal year 2024, which began back on Oct. 1.\n\nDefense\n\nCongress plans to spend $824.5 billion on the Defense spending bill, which predominantly funds the Pentagon, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThat bill includes funding for a 5.2% pay raise for military and civilian defense employees that will be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2024. The basic allowance for housing will increase by 5.4% and the basic allowance for sustenance will increase by 1.7%.\n\nThat total spending level would be divvied up among several core programs, including $176.2 billion for military personnel, an increase of $3.5 billion; $287.2 billion for operations and maintenance, $9.1 billion above current levels; $172 billion for procurement of military equipment, $9.8 billion more than the enacted level; and $148.3 billion for research and development, an $8.6 billion increase, according to a House GOP summary and a summary from House Democrats.\n\nThe Israeli Cooperative Missile Defense Programs would get $300 million for research and testing as well as $200 million for procurement, including for the Iron Dome and David\u2019s Sling. An additional $300 million would go toward the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.\n\nSenate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said in a statement the bill \u201cwill invest in our ability to stay ahead of the threat of China, defend our country from foreign adversaries while standing firm with America\u2019s allies, and take care of our servicemembers and their families.\u201d\n\nThe joint explanatory statement that accompanies the bill calls on the Department of Defense to look into why the military is having difficulty recruiting.\n\n\u201cThe Military Services are in the midst of one of the greatest recruiting crises since the creation of the all-volunteer force,\u201d it says. \u201cSince retention of enlisted servicemembers remains strong, those who continue to serve will be promoted to more senior grades, leaving a distressing shortfall in junior enlisted servicemembers, who account for 40 percent of the total active U.S. military force. The Nation needs America\u2019s youth to strongly consider uniformed service.\u201d\n\nThe package calls on the Defense Department to \u201cconduct an independent survey to better understand the failure of recruitment efforts by the services,\u201d according to House Republicans\u2019 summary of the bill.\n\nThe secretary of Defense must also brief the Defense Appropriations subcommittees on a proposal to increase the pay for junior enlisted troops.\n\nFinancial Services and General Government\n\nThe Financial Services and General Government bill \u2014 which funds the U.S. Treasury Department, Executive Office of the President, judiciary and more than two dozen smaller programs \u2014 would receive $26.1 billion in funding. That\u2019s about $1.1 billion below the current funding levels for those programs.\n\nSenate FSGG Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said in a written statement the \u201cbipartisan legislation invests in these critical priorities for our nation and more \u2014 including providing key resources to tackle the opioid epidemic and the necessary funding to build the new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt, Maryland.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuilding an economy that works for everyday Americans requires supporting our small businesses and community-based lenders, protecting consumers, building out our broadband infrastructure, and ensuring the security of our financial system,\u201d Van Hollen said.\n\nThe Department of Treasury would receive $14.2 billion, a $22.9 million reduction to its current funding levels. Of that total funding level, $12.3 billion would go to the Internal Revenue Service, equal to its current funding, and $158 million would go toward the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, according to a bill summary from House Democrats.\n\nThe Judiciary would get more than $8.6 billion to operate the U.S. courts, including the District Courts, Courts of Appeals and other judicial services. That funding level is an increase of nearly $170 million.\n\nIt provides $129 million for salaries and expenses of the U.S. Supreme Court and $20 million to care for the building and its grounds, according to the joint explanatory statement.\n\nThe bill includes $791 million in funding for the District of Columbia, a decrease of $1 million. That includes $40 million in residential tuition support, $30 million in emergency and security costs, $8 million in upgrades to sewer and water treatment, and $4 million in HIV/AIDS testing and treatment, according to a bill summary from House Democrats.\n\nThe Executive Office of the President would receive about $872.5 million \u2014 a $6 million decrease from the 2023 fiscal level, according to a bill summary from Democrats.\n\nThat includes $114 million for the Office of Administration, $19 million for the National Security Council, $22 million for the Office of National Cyber Director and $457 million for the National Drug Control Policy.\n\nThe bill would provide the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission with about $151 million in funding, a decrease of $1.5 million. The bill bars CPSC from issuing a ban on gas stoves, \u201cwhich would reduce consumer choice,\u201d according to a House GOP bill summary.\n\nThat policy provision would prohibit CPSC from \u201cpromulgating, implementing, administering, or enforcing any regulation to ban gas stoves as a class of products,\u201d according to the explanatory statement.\n\nCPSC has not taken any regulatory action to ban gas stoves. Agency officials have expressed concern about indoor air quality of gas stoves and the agency is researching the impacts on human health of those indoor gas emissions.\n\nThe Election Assistance Commission would receive a cut of $280,000 in funding for a total level of $27.7 million.\n\nA total of $55 million from that allocation would go toward Election Security Grants \u201cto make payments to states for activities to improve the administration of elections for Federal office, including to enhance election technology and make election security improvements,\u201d according to the explanatory statement.\n\nHomeland Security\n\nCongress plans to spend $62 billion on the Department of Homeland Security, including upgrading technology to screen for narcotics like fentanyl at U.S. ports of entry and an additional $495 million in funding to hire 22,000 border patrol agents.\n\nThe bill provides U.S. Customs and Border Protection with $19 billion, a $3 billion increase above current levels, and more than $9.6 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, an increase of $1.1 billion.\n\nIt puts in place policy requirements for detention centers, such as barring contracts with private companies that do not meet inspection standards and providing an additional $3 million to expand the use of ICE body cameras, according to the explanatory statement.\n\nThe legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to publish data on the 15th of every month on the total detention capacity and the number of \u201cgot aways\u201d and people \u201cturned back\u201d at the southern border, according to the joint explanatory statement.\n\nDHS refers to people as \u201cgot aways\u201d when an individual is observed making an unauthorized entry into the U.S. and is not turned away, or apprehended. That data is not publicly available.\n\nThe Office of the Secretary and Executive Management would get $404 million, an increase of about $20 million. About $30 million of that funding would go \u201cto support the safe reunification of families who were unjustly separated at the U.S.-Mexico border by the Trump Administration,\u201d according to House Democrats\u2019 summary of the bill.\n\nThe bill provides $5.1 billion for Enforcement and Removal Operations, an increase of $900 million above current funding. Of that, $355 million would go toward 41,500 detention beds.\n\nThe bill would appropriate $11.8 billion for the U.S. Coast Guard, a $122.7 million boost; $10.6 billion for the Transportation Security Administration, an increase of $1.2 billion; and $25.3 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a funding cut of $72.9 million.\n\nThe FEMA funding would go toward several projects, with $20 billion of those funds for disaster relief.\n\nLabor-HHS-Education\n\nThe bill would appropriate $13.7 billion for the Labor Department, $145 million less than current funding levels and $79 billion for the Education Department, a cut of $500 million, according to the House GOP summary.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department would get $116.8 billion, or about $3.9 billion less than the $120.7 billion provided during the last fiscal year. The House Democrats\u2019 summary of the bill, however, says that when earmarks are factored into the total spending level, HHS would get a $955 million increase.\n\nSenate Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee Chair Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, said in a written statement the bill \u201chelps take on the fentanyl and opioid crisis, expand access to affordable child care, invest in critical mental health and affordable health care programs, and connect Americans with the education and workforce training they need to land good-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nFunding for HHS would go to numerous health programs, including a $300 million increase to the National Institutes of Health for a total spending level of $48.6 billion.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would get $9.2 billion, more than $4.5 million above its current funding level.\n\nTitle X family planning grants would get $286 million in funding, the same amount they currently receive, despite House Republicans proposing to completely eliminate the program.\n\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, a central component of the nation\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the mpox outbreak, would get $3.6 billion, a $5 million increase.\n\nOf that total spending level, $1 billion would go toward the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and $980 million would go to the Strategic National Stockpile. That represents an increase of $65 million and $15 million, respectively.\n\nThe bill includes a $1 billion increase in funding for child care and early learning programs within HHS, according to Senate Democrats\u2019 summary of the legislation.\n\nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant would see a $725 million, 9%, increase in funding compared to current levels, for a total appropriation of $8.8 billion. Another $12.27 billion would go toward Head Start programs, a boost of $275 million over the current level.\n\n\u201cSustained annual increases to our federal investments in child care and Head Start are critical in tackling the child care crisis and helping to ensure more families can find and afford the quality, affordable child care and early childhood education options they need,\u201d Senate Democrats\u2019 summary says. \u201cWith the new investments provided in this bill, annual discretionary funding for CCDBG and Head Start over the last three fiscal years has increased by $4.4 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s spending would go to numerous initiatives, including $24.6 billion for student financial aid programs.\n\nPell Grants, which go to about 7 million lower-income college students, would continue to have a maximum award of $7,395 during the 2024-2025 academic year. The Federal Work Study program for college students would also get equal funding at $1.2 billion.\n\nThe Labor-HHS-Education bill continues to include the so-called Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding from being used for abortions with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant person.\n\nThe decades-old provision, first added in the 1970s in a slightly different form, affects patients in federal health care programs like Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nSimilar provisions on abortion access exist throughout many of the other government funding bills.\n\nLegislative Branch\n\nThe Legislative Branch Appropriations bill includes $6.75 billion for operations in the Capitol, including funding related to the summer\u2019s party conventions and the presidential inauguration in January 2025.\n\nThe bill would boost funding for the U.S. Capitol Police to $792 million, a 7.8% increase from fiscal 2023.\n\nThe measure includes funding for retention and recruitment programs of Capitol Police officers, including student loan payments and tuition reimbursements. Capitol Police officers, the force responsible for security at the Capitol complex, reported lower morale in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\u201cThis is an essential investment in democracy and oversight that bolsters the legislative branch\u2019s capacity to better serve the public,\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. \u201cThis bill delivers the funding and infrastructure required for the U.S. Capitol Police to safeguard the Capitol complex and keep it accessible to the public.\u201d\n\nA joint explanatory statement accompanying the bill says the measure would allow $2 million for Capitol Police to protect members of Congress outside the Capitol complex but within the Washington, D.C., region. Members have experienced increased threats in recent years.\n\nThe measure also includes funding for quadrennial events related to the presidential election.\n\nCapitol Police would receive $3.2 million for overtime to support the national political conventions \u2014 Republicans\u2019 in Milwaukee and Democrats\u2019 in Chicago \u2014 over the summer and to prepare for the inauguration in January.\n\nInauguration Day is in the next fiscal year, which begins in October, but expenses associated with preparing for it could be incurred this year. The bill would allocate nearly $3.7 million for salaries and expenses associated with the inauguration.\n\nThe bill would provide $16.6 million for Capitol grounds, House and Senate offices, and the Capitol Power Plant.\n\nThe measure includes a provision that would claw back unspent funds from members\u2019 Representational Allowances, the accounts that reimburse senators and representatives for official expenses. Unspent funds from those accounts would be used to pay down the national debt.\n\nThe measure includes a longstanding policy freezing members\u2019 pay.\n\nState-Foreign Operations\n\nCongress plans to allocate just over $58.3 billion for the Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development and other related programs, including refugee emergency assistance and diplomatic activities.\n\nRepublican lawmakers are touting an overall cut to the bill \u2014 down from last year\u2019s $59.7 billion total.\n\nThe bill includes $11.8 billion for the U.S. State Department and USAID and $10.3 billion for international development, including a loan to the International Monetary Fund to provide economic relief for some of the world\u2019s poorest nations.\n\nThe bill allocates $10 billion for global health initiatives that focus on combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, as well as providing vaccination programs for children.\n\nOf that health funding, Democrats cheered that the bill \u201cprotects longstanding funding,\u201d as highlighted by Murray\u2019s office, for family planning and reproductive health services in poor nations around the globe, for which nearly $524 million is allocated, remaining at the same level as the current spending level.\n\nFunding appropriated to the president for multilateral assistance to international organizations and programs \u2014 ranging from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to programs for victims of torture \u2014 is set to drop to $436.9 million from last year\u2019s funding level of $508.6 million.\n\nThat reduction, in part, reflects current political tension over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAbsent from the bill are funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, a primary humanitarian organization in the Palestinian Gaza Strip and West Bank territories. Many Western nations cut UNRWA funding after Israel accused 13 of its employees of taking part in the Oct. 7 attacks and many more of sympathizing with Hamas and other militant groups. The agency received $75 million from the U.S. in fiscal year 2023.\n\nAnother notable absence from the bill is funding for the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, which received $17.5 million from the U.S. in last year\u2019s funding bill.\n\nRepublicans celebrated the elimination of funding for the agency\u2019s inquiry into human rights abuses in Palestinian territories, which the UN Human Rights Council opened after a flare-up of violence in May 2021. The inquiry began to collect evidence of war crimes \u201ccommitted by all sides\u201d shortly after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 and taking roughly 240 hostages.\n\nThe bill will meet the annual U.S. $3.3 billion commitment to Israel this year among the $8.9 billion in security assistance to foreign governments.\n\nThe funding roadmap for U.S. international activities extends several programs, notably authorizing an additional 12,000 Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. during its war in Afghanistan.\n\n(ARIANA FIGUEROA, JACOB FISCHLER, AND ASHLEY MURRAY contributed to this article)\n\nRelated",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don\u2019t show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won\u2019t be made until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dumpster fire\u2019 \u2013\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers\u2019 bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump\u2019s Save America political action committee \u2014 money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters \u2014 and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\u201d a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign described Trump\u2019s finances as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s filings paint a bleak picture for Republicans,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa wrote on Thursday.\n\nBut with a tight election looming and Trump leading Biden in key swing states in recent polls, Democrats will be trying to keep their war chest as full as possible.\n\nBiden will be joined at a fundraiser in New York on March 28 by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the first event of its kind to feature three Democratic presidents and among the most lucrative in party history.\n\nThe gala show is set to raise $10 million for Biden\u2019s campaign, with guests having to fork out $100,000 each to pose in a photo with the 42nd, 44th and 46th US presidents, NBC News reported.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Some political experts have said the legislation would easily pass by a wide margin, and others have blasted the Speaker for his refusal, noting his history as a backbencher of voting against supporting Ukraine.\n\nOne week ago McConnell told reporters, \u201cI want to encourage the Speaker again to allow a vote \u2013 let the House speak\u201d on the Senate\u2019s Ukraine aid bill.\n\nMore than a month ago, on February 13, the Senate passed a $95 billion aid package, known as the national security supplemental, with funding for Ukraine and Israel. As soon as it passed Johnson made clear it would not see a vote in the House. Donald Trump opposes the legislation.\n\n\u201cThe foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities,\u201d CNN reported at the time. The vote was 70-29, and included 22 Republicans, among them, McConnell.\n\n\u201cEvery day that the national security supplemental stands as a Senate-passed bill and not a law is the day that America\u2019s adversaries smile,\u201d McConnell declared in a five-minute speech Tuesday on the Senate floor (video below). \u201cThe decision before Congress both in annual appropriations as well as the supplemental are about more than Ukraine or Israel. They are about whether America has the will to defend our interests and uphold our influence.\u201d\n\nPunchbowl News senior congressional reporter Andrew Desiderio called McConnell\u2019s remarks an \u201cimplicit jab at Johnson \u2014 though not by name.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Target on the Back of Every Brown Person\u2019: SCOTUS Slammed for \u2018Show Me Your Papers\u2019 Ruling\n\nMcConnell also warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201con track to pass Joseph Stalin as the longest ruling despot in modern Russian history.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the past two years, Putin has sacrifice tens of thousands of his countrymen on the altar of an obscene neo-Soviet fantasy of Stalinist empire building. The human cost of Russia\u2019s war progression to Russians and Ukrainians alike is truly treacherous.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that \u201cformer Russian President Medvedev laid out exactly how Putin intends for his lawless conquest to end. Here\u2019s what he said: The entire territory of Ukraine is the territory of the Russian Federation. As he sees it Ukraine\u2019s complete and unconditional surrender, full demilitarization and reparations to Russia will help forge a benevolent consensus of peace.\u201d\n\nMcConnell added that \u201cPutin and his allies are emboldened precisely because the West is hesitating, because America is hesitating. They\u2019re spelling out their true intentions because they sense that we might not have the resolve to actually resist them. Here\u2019s the truth. Russia is playing for keeps. It\u2019s set on subjugating its sovereign democracy. Whole hog. There is every reason to believe the war ends with a negotiated outcome, most wars do. But it\u2019s absurd and self defeating to insist on negotiations without preparing Ukraine to operate from a position of strength. Whether or when Putin ever decides to turn from his bid for total conquest to the negotiating table, it will be lethal Western assistance that determines what comes next.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Ramaswamy Eyed for Homeland Security Head if Trump Re-Elected: Report\n\n\u201cThat is why Congress does need to influence the eventual outcome of the conflict. What we do will determine whether an administration that wants to facilitate negotiations has the leverage to produce terms favorable to America and our allies. Our next move will either reaffirm America\u2019s global influence, or kneecap both Washington and Kyiv.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Congress does its job, it\u2019ll be American weapons in Ukrainian hands, and stronger forces and intense industrial capacity. here at home that determines what conclusions the world draws from the first major landmark in Europe since 1945.\u201d\n\nWatch below or at this link.",

            "text": "Donald Trump knows the value of a historical rewrite.\n\nFor two decades, Trump has pitched and re-pitched versions of his own story that seriously revised some of the facts we all knew about him.\n\nLong before he was a one-term president, Trump was a New York real estate developer and casino operator known for being brash \u2013 and often bankrupt.\n\nThen came \"The Apprentice,\" NBC's \"alleged\" reality television show that incongruously cast Trump in 2004 as a business whiz who could do no wrong, a profitable role that helped save him financially and then propel him to the presidency.\n\nTrump is still at it, rewriting history as quick as he can make it.\n\nTrump has go-to lies he tells on repeat for the sake of his followers\n\nConsider his speech Saturday in Dayton, Ohio, when Trump pushed his three favorite lies as historical rewrites: The 2020 election he lost was \"rigged,\" we were all better off four years ago with him as president, and the goons who attacked the Capitol at his urging on Jan. 6, 2021, are really \"patriots\" who have done no wrong.\n\nWhy does Trump tell these lies? Because he knows they work, at least with his existing supporters. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll in January found that two-thirds of Trump voters don't trust the 2020 election results and many were softening their views on the rioters who attacked the Capitol.\n\n'Bloodbath' if Trump loses?Trump's threat wasn't even the most dangerous thing he said all weekend\n\nA salute to the Jan. 6 'patriots'\n\nTrump opened Saturday's speech with his \"patriots\" so let's start there. He took to the stage and saluted as an announcer asked the crowd to stand \"for the horribly and unfairly treated Jan. 6 hostages.\"\n\nWhat followed was a now standard Trump rally recording of \"Justice For All,\" sung by a choir of defendants detained on Jan. 6 rioting charges, singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" with verses interspersed with Trump reciting lines from the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nTrump told the crowd the \"hostages\" have been \"treated terribly and very unfairly\" and vowed to do something about that if he wins in November. But then he made it all about himself.\n\n\"You fight an election and they end up indicting you because you fought a crooked election,\" Trump complained, before circling back to that point nearly an hour into his speech, claiming, \"I'm being indicted for you.\"\n\nHere's the truth: Tens of thousands of people attended Trump's Jan. 6 rally and some of the them marched to the Capitol. Many were peaceful. Others fought with police, smashed windows and stole government property.\n\nLet the election begin.Biden must win back 2020 voters. Trump only cares about MAGA.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice reports that more than 1,300 people have been charged from nearly all 50 states. The roster of sentences runs 94 pages long and is filled with people who received probation, home detention or prison terms of a few days or weeks.\n\nAbout a third of those defendants earned longer terms by assaulting or impeding law enforcement.\n\nIf you consider yourself a law-and-order kind of person who also considers these people \"hostages,\" then you are not, in fact, a law-and-order kind of person.\n\nTrump is still claiming 2020 was 'rigged' \u2013 and claims he'll stop 2024 from being stolen, too\n\nFor Trump, 2024 was always going to be about 2020.\n\nThe news outlet Axios prompted some serious social media skepticism two weeks ago with a report, citing unnamed Trump top advisers, saying that he was shifting away from talking about old grievances like the 2020 election and focusing more on 2024 issues like the economy. It was hard to imagine Trump dropping that talk.\n\nAnd he didn't. His speech Saturday with all the old gripes, especially the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\"The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024,\" Trump said. \"Not going to allow it to happen.\"\n\nYou know what else isn't going to happen? Trump won't \u2013 even can't \u2013 stop talking about it. His loss is an affront to his ego, which runs his every move. He will never, ever let that go.\n\nBut I understand why his campaign staff wants him to. The same USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll in January that found his supporters agree with him about 2020 also found that other voters see it as bunk. For Biden supporters, 98% say he was elected fairly while 82% of voters considering third-party candidates agree.\n\nTrump's litany of grievance sells with his supporters. But it can also drive away the independent and undecided voters who know it is nonsense. Presidencies are won by building coalitions, not pushing voters away.\n\nTrump and dictators:Republicans clapped when 'coolest dictator' defended Trump. Somehow that makes sense.\n\nTrump's obsession with 2020 will overwhelm his efforts this year. He just can't cope with a loss.\n\nHere's the truth: Trump had many chances in court in 2020 to make his case about the conduct of election. His sweeping public claims were backed by nothing of substance in those cases. He whiffed.\n\nTrump says we were better off four years ago, when COVID tore through the world\n\nTrump started Monday with his oddest form of historical rewrite, a post on his social media site that said in predictable all capital letters, \"ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO?\"\n\nThe headlines four years ago Monday were that COVID-19 had spread to all 50 states, and that Trump's White House was pushing for checks to be sent to all Americans to deal with the impending economic impact of the epidemic, including a spike in unemployment and plunging stock prices on Wall Street.\n\nAlso, an NPR/\"PBS NewsHour\"/Marist poll found that 60% of Americans didn't trust what Trump was saying then about the epidemic.\n\nFacebook's \"memories\" app will undoubtedly show you this week what you were up to four years ago. Chances are, it will remind you of a time when everything shifted in your life. My Facebook page just showed me a post I put up about working from home for a few weeks. That turned into nearly two years.\n\nTrump, speaking to his faithful followers Saturday, said his success from four years ago was the reason he's their nominee again for president.\n\n\"Because you love the job I did for four years,\" he said. \"You want to get back to the best economy that we've ever had.\"\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk County University Poll from last week found voters trust Trump to handle the economy slightly more than Biden, 40% to 38%, but that some see an economic rebound in the works.\n\nHere's the truth: Trump had a healthy economy with low inflation and rising wages, right up until it smashed into the epidemic. He likes to skip over the part where, in the fourth year of his presidency, everything took a nosedive.\n\nWho can blame him? All politicians play to their strengths and pooh-pooh the negative. But that's an easier sell in the primaries when they're talking to likely supporters. That's all over. We're in the general election now, even if Nov. 5 is still 33 weeks away.\n\nBiden and his campaign seize on every historical rewrite Trump offers because they know there's a big pool of voters out there who remember the shock of the country shutting down in March 2020, the tanking economy that followed, and the stark video of Capitol violence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump's campaign wants him to move on. But he can't. And Biden potentially benefits with every rewrite.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan",

            "text": "Lawmakers in the Vermont House are poised to vote Wednesday on one of the biggest energy bills of the legislative session. Among other things, it would make every electric utility in Vermont purchase 100% of its power from renewable resources by 2035.\n\nIt would also require that a lot more of that power come from new renewable energy sources built in Vermont and New England.\n\nCost estimates for the proposal have varied widely. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what we know so far.\n\nWhat does the bill do?\n\nUnder current state regulations, Vermont utilities have to get 75% of the power in their portfolios from renewables by 2032. Of that, about 10% has to come from renewables built within Vermont.\n\nThis bill, H.289, would require the biggest utilities in the state \u2014 like Green Mountain Power \u2014 to get to 100% renewable electricity by 2030. Vermont\u2019s smaller, town-owned utilities would have until 2035.\n\nFor electric utilities that are already at 100% renewable \u2014 like Washington Electric Coop and Burlington Electric Department \u2014 they will have to ensure that as their loads grow from customers switching to electric vehicles and installing heat pumps, that extra power is coming from renewables.\n\nThe bill also proposes to double the amount of power utilities have to buy from renewables built recently in Vermont. Additionally, it creates a brand new requirement that they purchase power from new renewables built in New England, which could include offshore wind in the future.\n\nMore from Vermont Public: Vermont just adopted a Climate Action Plan. Here's how it says we should reduce emissions.\n\nOn paper, Vermont has one of the least carbon-intensive electricity sectors of any state in the U.S. However, because we\u2019re part of the interconnected New England grid, and that grid is mostly powered by natural gas at any point in time, we still consume fossil fuels.\n\nBuilding new renewables in places where there is grid capacity and storage for them is one way to decrease the amount of fossil fuels New England burns as a region, and burning fossil fuels is the cause of global climate change.\n\nOne of the core debates playing out in the Statehouse is over how much Vermont should do to reduce the region\u2019s \u2014 and our own \u2014 dependence on fossil fuels in the electric sector.\n\nWhat would this bill mean for electric rates in the state?\n\nThe short answer is: What\u2019s proposed in the bill would raise electric rates. However, at this point, there is no granular modeling that shows exactly how much.\n\nWhat really has the potential to drive cost in the policy are the new renewables, particularly ones built in Vermont.\n\nLegislative analysts put out a memo this week that breaks the cost of this bill into two buckets.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the cost of buying the new renewable energy. The cost of renewables is coming down, but building new stuff always carries an upfront cost.\n\nThe Joint Fiscal Office estimates that it will cost between $150 million and $250 million by 2035 to comply with this new policy.\n\nMore from Brave Little State: How much does Vermont's power grid depend on fossil fuels?\n\nThen, there\u2019s what it might cost to upgrade our grid \u2014 the poles and wires and substations themselves \u2014 to make room for this new renewable power. There\u2019s more uncertainty there, but the analysts say they expect it could be about between $0 and $200 million by 2035.\n\nAnd that figure doesn\u2019t include upgrades to the distribution systems that utilities own \u2014 the more granular parts of the grid. There are major swaths of the state where that is constrained as well.\n\nFor context, the Department of Public Service projects Vermonters will spend $14.5 billion on electricity between 2025 and 2035.\n\nAt the end of the day, experts on all sides say these numbers are helpful, but it\u2019s still hard to know at this point what this policy change would mean for electric bills in the future.\n\nWhat do we not know about how much this will cost?\n\nLong story short: a lot. And a big part of that is that we don\u2019t really know what it will cost to upgrade our grid to be ready for these new in-state renewables.\n\nRight now, there are places where Vermont doesn\u2019t have the grid capacity for any more new renewables, and upgrades are expensive.\n\nBut VELCO \u2014 the grid operator \u2014 says there are some investors who are interested in building transmission lines that would go between Quebec and future offshore wind, potentially through the very burdened parts of Vermont\u2019s grid.\n\nVELCO says these projects \u2014 if they are successful \u2014 could help a lot to alleviate the cost to ratepayers of building out more transmission.\n\nHowever, transmission projects do fall through, as happened recently with the Twin States Clean Energy Link project. Transmission can be difficult to build in New England, so there\u2019s uncertainty there.\n\nThe Scott administration put out its own cost estimate earlier this year \u2014 at twice what legislative analysts landed on, at roughly $1 billion over the next decade. The estimate relied heavily on modeling by VELCO that looks at investments needed to ensure grid reliability. VELCO clarified those figures were not meant to forecast the cost of power \u2014 nor were they tailored to the policy proposal put forward by the legislature.\n\nThe administration has since agreed the new numbers from legislative analysts \u2014 $150 million to $450 million \u2014 are reasonable, but still view the estimate for transmission costs as being a bit low.\n\nRenewable developers contend that the cost estimate from legislative analysts should be viewed as a high-end forecast for cost, because it doesn\u2019t consider the volatility of natural gas prices in shaping electricity rates, though Vermont utilities tend to buy most of their power through long-term contracts that insulate them somewhat.\n\nAnd VELCO says even if Vermont does nothing to update its Renewable Energy Standard, our aging grid is going to need hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades to be ready for the future.\n\nAre there ways to keep that cost down?\n\nYes. Some environmental groups are saying Vermont needs a parallel policy that forces those new renewables to be built in the places where there is grid capacity for them \u2014 and load demand for them.\n\nThis would allow the state to maximize its existing infrastructure, potentially forestalling pricey upgrades.\n\nThe state doesn\u2019t require that right now, which is part of how we got to this situation of imbalance \u2014where parts of the grid are at risk of being overburdened.\n\nThe Scott administration has advocated for only requiring as many new in-state renewables as we have capacity for with existing infrastructure. Renewable developers and most environmental groups contend this bill does just that.\n\nAdditionally, the Joint Fiscal Office says utilities could play a role in mitigating costs by building out storage and creating more programs to spread out electricity use over the course of the day, like incentivizing people to charge their electric vehicles at night, for example.\n\nWhy do lawmakers feel this is necessary right now? What do people say about whether we should do this?\n\nVermont\u2019s Climate Action Plan and Comprehensive Energy Plan both call on the state to go to 100% carbon-free electricity.\n\nEven though there\u2019s been disagreement between lawmakers and the Scott administration over how to get there, both bodies support that transition.\n\nAn earlier proposal from the Scott administration had proposed requiring every utility in the state reach 100% clean energy, which would include nuclear power, by 2030, with lower requirements for purchasing new renewables.\n\nThe administration argues the emissions benefit from that approach, for Vermont, would be greater sooner than what is proposed now \u2014 though TJ Poor, director of utilities planning for the Department of Public Service, acknowledged in an interview that the societal emissions benefit of H.289 is greater because it requires utilities to support more new renewables.\n\nH.289, the bill heading to the House floor, has broad support from utilities in the state and from renewable developers, as well as several environmental groups, including VPIRG.\n\nHowever, some conservative lawmakers and the environmental group Vermonters for a Clean Environment \u2014 which has often opposed new renewable energy development in the state over concerns about land use \u2014 say Vermont\u2019s power is clean enough as it is.\n\nAnd they point out that utilities and renewable developers, who broadly support the bill, stand to benefit financially from it \u2014 especially from this requirement for new renewables within Vermont.\n\nTo date, no one has modeled how much the bill would reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Vermont, or in the region.\n\nAnnette Smith of Vermonters for a Clean Environment says she has concerns about whether the bill asks Vermonters to pay for environmental benefits people in other states will enjoy.\n\nHowever, she supports elements of the policy \u2014 including eliminating group net metering and efforts to stand up a community solar program in the state.\n\n\u201cBut the rest of this \u2014 changing the requirements for in-state [renewables] and for totals by certain years? We\u2019re not ready for it,\u201d she says.\n\nMore from Vermont Public: New report explores how sourcing 100% of Vermont's electricity from renewables would affect rates\n\nOthers say Vermont needs to do everything it can to fight climate change right now, and cleaner electricity is part of that.\n\nRep. Laura Sibilia is an Independent from Dover who sits on the House Energy and Environment Committee, and says lawmakers are also deeply concerned about affordability. She called the earlier, more speculative forecast from the Scott administration \u201cpolitical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe energy transition is not optional,\u201d she said in early March. \u201cHow we act in it \u2014 we have a lot of options. But it\u2019s happening. Vermonters themselves are driving that transition, global markets are driving that transition.\u201d\n\nTJ Poor, director of utility planning for the Department of Public Service, says his department would like to see the cost of distribution system upgrades included in the analysis.\n\n\u201cI think the focus is that there are costs. They are significant. And there are ways to mitigate the potential risk of those costs,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I hope that this legislation \u2026 as it goes forward, that that can be an improvement.\u201d\n\nBen Edgerly-Walsh, with VPIRG \u2014 which has lobbied in support of the bill \u2014 says the numbers say otherwise.\n\n\u201cI think that what the Joint Fiscal Office has confirmed is that this is an affordable way of deploying a whole lot of new renewable energy,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve testified to all along and when they dove deeper into the substance of the bill, that\u2019s exactly what they found as well.\u201d\n\nVermont is part of the U.S Climate Alliance, a group of 25 states that have agreed to keep complying with the Paris Accords, even if our federal government pulls out, which we did under former President Donald Trump \u2014 though President Joe Biden has since rejoined. As the presidential election approaches, there are many who make the case that there is power in individual states taking action on climate change.\n\nHave questions, comments or tips?

Intel estimated the new plants will create 3,000 new jobs in the company and another 6,000 spots for the construction workers who build them. Arizona will play a critical role in determining whether Democrats can protect their slim 51-49 majority in the Senate. The race will pit Democratic U.S. Representative Ruben Gallego against Republican former television broadcaster Kari Lake, a vocal Trump supporter.\n\nTight Contest\n\nBiden won Arizona in a tight 2020 race against Trump. A Feb. 22 Emerson College poll of 1,000 registered voters in the state had Trump leading Biden 46% to 43%, which is within the margin of error of 3 percentage points. In that same poll, Gallego led Lake 46% to 39%, with 15% undecided.\n\nIntel said the new, expanded facilities will be in the city of Chandler, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Phoenix. That puts it within driving distance of the state\u2019s two most competitive House districts. With Republicans holding a narrow 219-213 majority, a few changes could flip control of the chamber.\n\nBoth those seats are held by Republicans, Representatives David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, who are expected to face tough races against Democrats. Republicans and Democrats hold their primary elections on July 30.\n\nOfficials with the two campaigns did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSchweikert, who won reelection in 2022 by 3,200 votes, voted against the massive semiconductor investment bill, as did most of his House Republican colleagues.\n\nCiscomani is a first-term Republican who was not in Congress in 2022. Gallego voted in favor of the bill.\n\n\u201cAnytime you can deliver actual results to a company and a state \u2026 it\u2019s a net positive,\u201d said Jessica Taylor, an editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nShe added that whether Democrats actually gain votes depends in part on how effective the White House is in communicating going forward. That is an area that the Biden administration has come under criticism for and the president himself has expressed frustrations over.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of economics are people concerned about? Things like this or more like kitchen-table issues,\u201d Taylor said referring to consumer prices and inflation. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest hurdle that they have with undecided voters.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign finance co-chair Paul Egerman was among the major signatories of the letter.\n\nTheir letter blasted the current president for supporting Israel\u2019s war effort in Gaza and the country\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIt stated, \u201cRegrettably President Biden has provided what appears to be unconditional support for the Israeli operation,\u201d it reads. \u201cThe Biden administration has been providing armaments, including 2,000-pound bombs which have been used to flatten entire civilian neighborhoods, causing massive casualties with a high ratio of women and children.\u201d\n\nBiden has been somewhat critical of Israel\u2019s methods of waging war in Gaza in recent weeks, even expressing hope that Israel would arrange a ceasefire soon.\n\nThe letter acknowledged Biden\u2019s perspective but pointed out that it hasn\u2019t changed much at all. \u201cPresident Biden has asked Netanyahu to minimize civilian casualties but has threatened no consequences as Netanyahu has continued to ignore him.\u201d\n\nIt went on to grill Biden, arguing that his policy is alienating voters and thereby undermining the hefty contributions that these donors have given to his campaign and the party ahead of 2024.\n\nThe letter continued, \u201cAs donors and activists, we have committed much time and treasure in helping increase the turnout of likely Biden voters, particularly among young voters and voters of color.\u201d\n\nSCHUMER\u2019S ANTI-NETANYAHU SPEECH STRENGTHENS BIBI IN ISRAEL\u2019S WAR TO DEFEAT HAMAS\n\n\u201cMany of these voters are now questioning whether the Democratic Party shares their values,\u201d it said, adding, \u201cIf they stay home or vote for a third-party candidate, there is the very real danger that President Biden will be defeated in November.\u201d\n\nThe letter went on to mention how much of a \u201cdisaster\u201d a second Trump administration would be \u201cfor our country and a bigger disaster for Israel/Palestine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the disillusionment of a critical portion of the Democratic coalition, the Gaza war is increasing the chances of a Trump victory,\u201d it declared.\n\nThis letter is just the latest written by prominent liberals criticizing Biden\u2019s pro-Israel stance. Last December, dozens of White House interns signed a letter demanding Biden to push for a cease-fire in Israel\u2019s war and slamming him and Vice President Harris for ignoring the \u201cpleas of the American people.\u201d\n\nMore than a dozen Biden campaign staffers sent their boss a letter in January pushing for a cease-fire as well. It stated, \u201cAs your staff, we believe it is both a moral and electoral imperative for you to publicly call for a cessation of violence.\u201d",

There is too much important work to be done for the American people to continue wasting time on this charade,\u201d White House counsel Edward Siskel wrote in a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, last week.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee summoned two former business associates of Hunter Biden\u2019s, Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis.\n\nGalanis, who is serving a prison sentence related to fraud charges, was expected to appear virtually. Both have previously appeared for closed-door interviews with the panel.\n\nThe panel had invited Hunter Biden and business associate Devon Archer, but both declined. In a lengthy back-and-forth with the committee, Hunter Biden initially insisted on a public hearing before finally submitting to a closed-door interview.\n\nDemocrats on the House panel had invited Lev Parnas to the hearing.\n\nA businessman, Parnas worked with former President Donald Trump\u2019s then-lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to try to uncover evidence of wrongdoing by Biden and his family in Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election in which Biden defeated Trump, a Republican.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was unclear when House Republicans would decide on next steps in their probe. James Comer, the Oversight Committee chair, said publicly that he was considering making criminal referrals instead of drafting articles of impeachment, though he has yet to say who or what crimes those referrals would target.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 slim House majority will likely make impeachment difficult. The chamber held a second vote last month to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, the administration\u2019s top border official, after a first vote failed.\n\nThe Democratic-led Senate, which has yet to take it up, will almost certainly vote to acquit Mayorkas.",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more -- $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don't show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won't be made until April.\n\nBiden's campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \"historic\" total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n- 'Dumpster fire' -\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers' bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump's Save America political action committee -- money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump's woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \"witch hunt,\" seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters -- and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\"I'm calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\" a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \"KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\" his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden's campaign described Trump's finances as a \"dumpster fire.\"\n\n\"Trump's filings paint a bleak picture for Republicans,\" Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa wrote on Thursday.\n\nBut with a tight election looming and Trump leading Biden in key swing states in recent polls, Democrats will be trying to keep their war chest as full as possible.\n\nBiden will be joined at a fundraiser in New York on March 28 by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the first event of its kind to feature three Democratic presidents and among the most lucrative in party history.\n\nThe gala show is set to raise $10 million for Biden's campaign, with guests having to fork out $100,000 each to pose in a photo with the 42nd, 44th and 46th US presidents, NBC News reported.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Instead, the campaign visited East Palestine on the one-year anniversary of the Norfolk Southern derailment. The President vowed to continue holding Norfolk Southern accountable for their \u201cact of greed.\u201d\n\nRight around that time, the news hit that funding from the CHIPS Act for Intel was in flux and that the company was delaying the launch date for the Ohio chip manufacturing site.\n\nThings changed yesterday, though. The Biden campaign had a scheduled trip to Arizona to work the campaign trail. As I already pointed out, Arizona is the other site for Intel\u2019s manufacturing plan. That detail made it hard for the campaign to visit without acknowledging Intel.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s all about the politics this year.\n\nLong story short, Intel received some \u201ctimely\u201d news of $8.5 billion in direct funding, tax credits for the company\u2019s $100 billion investment, and eligibility for federal loans up to $11 billion.\n\nThe details are here if you\u2019d like to read Intel\u2019s press release .\n\nLet\u2019s get down to the rub.\n\nIntel shares are trading 1% in early trading, but the long-term prospects for the stock are very strong.\n\n(Click to enlarge)\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you get the opportunity to look at a company as it is transitioning into its future. IBM (IBM) comes to mind. General Electric (GE) is another. Intel is in that spot in time.\n\nThe stock broke into a long-term bull market in June of 2023 and 40% upside potential before they start breaking into new high territory. This stock is for the \u201cvalue\u201d investors as the company is likely to return to a different form of its former self.\n\nBottom Line\n\nI\u2019ve been an outspoken bull about Intel\u2019s long-term potential and believe that $42 is a bargain for the new company that is emerging in the semiconductor industry.",

Smith is prosecuting Trump in two separate federal cases, one involving Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and one involving his alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Both cases are still ongoing.\n\nTrump still faces charges in classified documents, election interference cases\n\nThe federal judges responsible have not brought an end to the two criminal cases brought against Trump as a result of Smith's investigations.\n\nTrump faces 40 counts in the classified documents case, including charges of obstructing justice, making false statements and trying to \"alter, destroy, mutilate or conceal evidence.\" More than 300 classified documents were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, over a year after he left the White House\n\nJudge Eileen Cannon is expected to postpone a May 20 trial date because of disputes in the case, and she has said it will probably be later than the prosecution's proposal of July 8. Trump\u2019s lawyers suggested Aug. 12, but also urged Cannon to postpone the trial until after the November election.\n\nFact check: Biden had nothing to do with Trump's indictment in classified documents probe\n\nTrump faces another four counts in the election interference case \u2013 three for conspiracy and one for obstruction. He is accused of falsely claiming election fraud and trying to overturn the legitimate 2020 election results.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan canceled a March 4 trial date as higher courts weigh Trump's claim that a former president is immune from prosecution for official acts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal and scheduled arguments for the week of April 22.\n\nIn the first comment, the social media user who made the post shared a link to an article published in January about Chutkan barring Smith from filing pretrial motions without permission as Trump's immunity claim is decided.

            "text": "Republican opposition continued to grow Tuesday against a $118 billion bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package ahead of a key vote in the Senate.\n\nThe bill is now on track to fail, as GOP infighting threatens to steamroll any congressional response to the border as well put aid to Ukraine and Israel in jeopardy.\n\nDespite containing policy aimed at toughening border restrictions pushed for by conservatives, the deal has faced relentless attacks from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who has said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber - if it ever makes it out of the Senate. Trump, who is hoping to make immigration a key plank of his presidential campaign, has suggested on Truth Social that approving additional resources for the border would make Republicans \u201clook bad.\u201d\n\nOffering a blunt assessment of the grim prospects facing the bill, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that the deal \u201cwill not become law,\u201d due to Johnson\u2019s opposition and concerns within the Senate GOP conference.\n\n\u201cWe had a very robust discussion about whether or not this product could ever become law, and it\u2019s been made pretty clear to us by the speaker that it will not become law,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo high-ranking members of Senate GOP leadership \u2013 John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, and John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican \u2013 announced that they will vote against the measure in an initial procedural vote on Wednesday, the latest blow to a deal that was negotiated by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the most conservative senators, along with Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n\nA majority of Senate Republicans are now either actively planning to vote \u201cno\u201d during the first procedural vote on the package Wednesday or leaning against the bill. Many Republicans have attacked the policy directly, and some have argued there should be more time to consider, debate and amend the bill after it was released on Sunday evening.\n\nThune, the Senate GOP whip, said that he plans to vote against proceeding to the bill on Wednesday and said that blocking the package will be the \u201cpredominate position\u201d of GOP senators. Later in the day, Thune said, \u201cI would expect that the motion to proceed to the bill will fail.\u201d\n\nBarrasso, the chairman of the Senate GOP Conference, said in a statement, \u201cI cannot vote for this bill. Americans will turn to the upcoming election to end the border crisis.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer harshly criticized Senate Republicans on Tuesday for deciding to oppose the package as it is currently written, accusing them of acting on Trump\u2019s marching orders.\n\n\u201cWe all know what\u2019s going on here. Donald Trump would rather keep the chaos at the border so he can exploit it on the campaign trail, instead of letting the Senate do the right thing and fix it. He would rather let Ukraine suffer on the battlefield, instead of being tough on Putin,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd instead of standing up to Donald Trump, Senate Republicans are ready to kill our best chance at fixing the border and ready to vote down this aid package for Ukraine in order to put what they think \u2013 they think \u2013 is their party\u2019s political interest above the interests of the country.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leader also went after Republican demands for more time to read the bill, noting that they had requested 72 hours, and saying he would offer to move the first procedural vote to Thursday if they want another day. \u201cI suspect they won\u2019t accept even that offer, because they really don\u2019t want more time. They\u2019re just using it as an excuse,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, another prominent senior Republican, said he plans to vote no on moving forward with the deal, adding that he wants to see changes to parts of the bill.\n\n\u201cWe need more time,\u201d Cornyn told CNN, adding later: \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 on the motion to proceed.\u201d\n\nMurphy, a key Democratic border deal negotiator, blasted Senate Republicans on Tuesday, calling them a \u201cdisaster\u201d and describing their treatment of Lankford, the top GOP negotiator, as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d saying he never expected they would leave him \u201changing out to dry as badly as they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never expected they would leave Senator Lankford hanging out to dry as badly as they did,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI thought they would be able to find the votes to support a very tough, conservative compromise that he was able to win.\u201d\n\nLankford said on Tuesday that he has been \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his colleagues who he says are mischaracterizing the package in order to reject it, rather than what is actually in the bill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s disappointing to me, is to say if you\u2019re going to disagree with it, disagree with it based on the facts of the bill, not something that\u2019s actually factually not true,\u201d he said, pointing to accusations that the package includes amnesty, allows thousands more migrants to enter the US, and incentivizes more people to cross the border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the misinformation that\u2019s out there, and how effective that has been,\u201d added Lankford.\n\nHe acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s not looking good\u201d for the package to eventually become law, as more GOP senators demand more time to consider the language or reject it outright.\n\nOn Tuesday, McConnell said, \u201cI want to congratulate Senator Lankford on a remarkable job of negotiating with the other side, getting the support of the border council, but it looks to me and to most of our members is that we have no real chance here to make a law.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and other Republicans have attacked the bill as too weak, it would mark a tough change to immigration law and would give the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board called the deal \u201cthe most restrictive migrant legislation in decades,\u201d saying \u201cits provisions include long-time GOP priorities\u201d in an op-ed titled \u201cA Border Security Bill Worth Passing.\u201d\n\nThe sweeping legislative package would also provide aid to key US allies abroad, including billions of dollars to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine.\n\nIt is unclear if Congress will be able to pass aid to Ukraine and Israel separate from border measures as many Republican senators had previously demanded that the issues be paired together.\n\nAsked if Congress should drop the border elements of the package and pass the rest of the security supplemental for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Cornyn indicated he supported that approach.\n\n\u201cI would say defer the border and do the rest,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is pushing to pass a stand-alone Israel aid package on Tuesday, but that is also on the brink of collapse amid opposition from far-right Republicans and Democratic leaders, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nPresident Joe Biden would veto a House standalone aid package for Israel, the White House said Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Administration spent months working with a bipartisan group of Senators to reach a national security agreement that secures the border and provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel, while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by conflicts around the world,\u201d the White House wrote in a statement. \u201cInstead of working in good faith to address the most pressing national security challenges, this bill is another cynical political maneuver.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

Doch das Verfahren liegt so gut wie auf Eis \u2013 aus Mangel an Beweisen. Die Wahl ist viel gef\u00e4hrlicher.\n\nWashington \u2013 Das Verfahren zur Amtsenthebung von Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden kommt nicht voran. Zwar hielten die Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses eine Anh\u00f6rung ab und pr\u00e4sentierten Zeugen, die die d\u00fcnnen Behauptungen wiederholten, dass Mitglieder der Familie Biden aus dem Namen ihres Vaters finanziell Kapital schlugen. Doch ob das reicht, um den Mann im Wei\u00dfen Haus auf diese Weise zu Fall zu bringen? Die Zweifel werden immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer.\n\nAmtsenthebungsverfahren gegen Joe Biden: Republikaner haben Probleme mit Beweisen\n\nDer Vorsitzende des House Oversight Committee, James Comer, hatte die Ermittlungen gegen Biden im vergangenen Jahr mit Anschuldigungen wegen schwerer Verbrechen und Vergehen eingeleitet, die die Republikaner seither nur mit M\u00fche unterst\u00fctzen konnten. F\u00fcnfzehn Monate sp\u00e4ter haben die Republikaner im Kongress keine Beweise oder Zeugenaussagen erhalten, die belegen, dass Joe Biden direkt an den Gesch\u00e4ften seines Sohnes Hunter Biden beteiligt war oder davon profitierte.\n\nUnd obwohl einige von Hunter Bidens engen Mitarbeitern seinen Vater in die N\u00e4he der an einigen Gesch\u00e4ften Beteiligten ger\u00fcckt haben \u2013 was die Behauptungen des Pr\u00e4sidenten, er habe nichts von Hunters Aktivit\u00e4ten gewusst, untergr\u00e4bt \u2013, entsprach keine der Anschuldigungen den Vorw\u00fcrfen der Republikaner, Hunter Bidens gesch\u00e4ftliche Aktivit\u00e4ten h\u00e4tten eine Einflussnahme erm\u00f6glicht, die Joe Biden und seine Familie bereichert habe.\n\nMit ihrer knappen Mehrheit ben\u00f6tigen die Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus nahezu Einstimmigkeit, um ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren gegen den Pr\u00e4sidenten zu verabschieden, was sie nicht haben. Stattdessen ist die Skepsis unter den Republikanern nur noch gewachsen, seit ein FBI-Informant angeklagt wurde, \u00fcber die Bidens gelogen zu haben, wodurch das, was als wichtiges Beweisst\u00fcck pr\u00e4sentiert worden war, ins Wanken geriet.\n\nThe Washington Post vier Wochen gratis lesen Ihr Qualit\u00e4ts-Ticket der washingtonpost.com: Holen Sie sich exklusive Recherchen und 200+ Geschichten vier Wochen gratis.\n\nDie Zweifel wachsen: Joe Biden muss die Amtsenthebung wohl nicht f\u00fcrchten\n\nIn Ermangelung dieser Stimmen haben sich Comer und andere Mitglieder der Untersuchungsaussch\u00fcsse auf die M\u00f6glichkeit einer Strafanzeige verlegt. Comer hat gedroht, \u201emehrere\u201c Strafanzeigen zu stellen, aber es bleibt unklar, ob die Gesetzgeber Pr\u00e4sident Biden formell eines Verbrechens beschuldigen werden und welche Verbrechen sie ihm vorwerfen.\n\n\u201eIch bin mir nicht sicher, wie wir den Pr\u00e4sidenten strafrechtlich belangen k\u00f6nnen, ohne ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren anzustrengen\u201c, sagte Abgeordneter Kelly Armstrong. \u201eIch meine, das [Justizministerium] wird das sowieso nie in Angriff nehmen.\u201c\n\nArmstrong, Mitglied des Justizausschusses des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses, f\u00fcgte hinzu, dass der Ausschuss gegen mehrere Zeugen, die vor dem Ausschuss ausgesagt haben, Strafverfahren wegen Verst\u00f6\u00dfen gegen den Foreign Agents Registration Act einleiten k\u00f6nnte. Hunter Biden, der es ablehnte, am Mittwoch zu erscheinen, sieht sich neun strafrechtlichen Anklagen in einem seit langem andauernden Bundessteuerfall und Anklagen wegen Waffenbesitzes gegen\u00fcber.\n\n\u201eMeine Meinung zu einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren im Allgemeinen? Es ist eine sehr hohe Messlatte, die sie erf\u00fcllen m\u00fcssen, und sie m\u00fcssen ihre Kollegen davon \u00fcberzeugen, dass es das Richtige ist\u201c, sagte der Abgeordnete Brian Fitzpatrick. \u201eWenn sie es ablehnen, ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren einzuleiten, ist das meiner Meinung nach die richtige Entscheidung.\u201c\n\nViele Anschuldigungen der Republikaner gegen Biden verpuffen\n\nDem offensichtlichen Zusammenbruch einer der wichtigsten Ermittlungen der Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus ging eine Reihe von Vorf\u00e4llen voraus, bei denen Comer, der sogar von einigen republikanischen Kollegen f\u00fcr seine Fox-News-zentrierte Herangehensweise an die Ermittlungen kritisiert wurde, Anschuldigungen gegen Biden und seinen Sohn erhob, bevor sie \u00f6ffentlich verpufften. Abgeordneter Jamie Raskin, der rangh\u00f6chste Demokrat im Oversight Committee, nannte die Anh\u00f6rung in seiner Er\u00f6ffnungsrede am Mittwoch \u201edas Ende des vielleicht spektakul\u00e4rsten Scheiterns in der Geschichte der Untersuchungen des Kongresses\u201c.\n\nTony Bobulinski, ein ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner von Hunter Biden, sagt am Mittwoch vor dem House Oversight Committee aus. \u00a9 Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post\n\n\u201eUnsere Kollegen bereiten sich jetzt offenbar darauf vor, ihr Gesicht zu wahren, indem sie die Amtsenthebungsfarce mit Strafantr\u00e4gen beenden\u201c, sagte Raskin. \u201eAber strafrechtliche Verweise erfordern Beweise f\u00fcr Verbrechen. Und die einzigen Verbrechen, die wir gesehen haben, sind die der eigenen Kronzeugen der Grand Old Party.\u201c\n\nJede Strafanzeige, die der Kongress an das Justizministerium richtet, w\u00e4re ein symbolischer Akt, der f\u00fcr sich genommen kein rechtliches Gewicht hat und den Staatsanw\u00e4lten die Entscheidung \u00fcberl\u00e4sst, ob sie Anklage erheben. Aber eine strafrechtliche Verweisung k\u00f6nnte die Feststellungen des Oversight Committee so deutlich wie m\u00f6glich zum Ausdruck bringen und den Republikanern, die versucht haben, unbegr\u00fcndete Behauptungen und Theorien \u00fcber Biden und seine Familie zu legitimieren, als Kommunikationsmittel dienen.\n\nEinige Mitglieder deuteten an, dass sie bereit seien, alle neuen Beweise, die die Ermittler des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses in der Zwischenzeit ans Tageslicht bringen k\u00f6nnten, zu pr\u00fcfen. Der Abgeordnete Mike Garcia merkte jedoch an, dass den Republikanern vor dem R\u00fcckkampf zwischen Biden und dem ehemaligen Pr\u00e4sidenten Donald Trump die Zeit davonlaufe - und dass Biden vor gr\u00f6\u00dferen Herausforderungen bei den Wahlen stehe als vor einem m\u00f6glichen Amtsenthebungsverfahren, das in einem von den Demokraten kontrollierten Senat scheitern d\u00fcrfte.\n\nDie Wahl gegen Donald Trump ist f\u00fcr Biden das viel gr\u00f6\u00dfere Problem\n\n\u201eLetztendlich wird das amerikanische Volk im Oktober oder November dar\u00fcber abstimmen, ob dieser Pr\u00e4sident f\u00fcr das Amt geeignet ist oder nicht\u201c, sagte Garcia. \u201eIch denke, er hat schon genug andere Herausforderungen und Misserfolge hinter sich, so dass ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren wahrscheinlich nicht einmal das Wahlergebnis beeinflussen w\u00fcrde\u201c.\n\nTony Bobulinski, ein ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner von Hunter Biden, und Jason Galanis, der wegen mehrfachen Betrugs eine fast 16-j\u00e4hrige Haftstrafe in Montgomery, Alabama, verb\u00fc\u00dft, sagten beide bei der Anh\u00f6rung am Mittwoch auf Gehei\u00df der Republikaner aus. Sie behaupteten beide, dass Joe Biden in die gesch\u00e4ftlichen Aktivit\u00e4ten seiner Familienmitglieder verwickelt war, bevor sie Details \u00fcber begrenzte Interaktionen mit Joe Biden angaben, um die Behauptungen zu untermauern.\n\nBobulinski verwies auf ein Treffen mit Joe Biden im Mai 2017, das von Hunter Biden und dem Bruder des Pr\u00e4sidenten, James, arrangiert worden war, als Beweis daf\u00fcr, dass Joe Biden von den Gesch\u00e4ften seines Sohnes mit ausl\u00e4ndischen Unternehmen wusste. Doch als Bobulinski am Mittwoch zu dem Treffen befragt wurde, erw\u00e4hnte er bei der Beschreibung des 45-min\u00fctigen Treffens in Los Angeles nicht ausdr\u00fccklich das Streben nach einem Gesch\u00e4ft mit CEFC, einem chinesischen Energiekonglomerat.\n\n\u201eWir sprachen \u00fcber meinen Hintergrund, den milit\u00e4rischen Hintergrund meiner Familie, die verschiedenen gesch\u00e4ftlichen Unternehmungen, die ich auf der ganzen Welt unternommen hatte, die Familie, mit der ich zusammenarbeitete - Joe verbrachte Zeit damit, \u00fcber seine Familie zu sprechen, \u00fcber einige der Trag\u00f6dien, die sie durchlebt hatten\u201c, beschrieb Bobulinski das Gespr\u00e4ch mit Joe Biden, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht im Amt war.\n\nRepublikaner pr\u00e4sentieren zweifelhafte Zeugen im Amtsenthebungsverfahren\n\nGalanis, der per Zoom vom Gef\u00e4ngnis aus aussagte, beschrieb auch eine \u201erelativ kurze Diskussion\u201c mit dem damaligen Vizepr\u00e4sidenten Biden im Mai 2014, nachdem Hunter Biden auf einer Party Galanis und eine kleine Gruppe von Personen - darunter die russische Milliard\u00e4rin Jelena Baturina und ihr Ehemann Juri Luschkow sowie Hunter Bidens ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner Devon Archer \u2013 beiseite genommen und Joe Biden \u00fcber den Lautsprecher angerufen hatte. Galanis behauptete, dass es in dem Gespr\u00e4ch um den bevorstehenden Besuch von Baturina und Luschkow in Washington ging und \u201esie dar\u00fcber sprachen, gut zu seinem Jungen zu sein\u201c. Auf die Frage, ob es bei diesem Anruf darum ging, dass Hunter Biden potenziellen Investoren \u201eZugang zur Marke Biden\u201c verschaffte, antwortete Galanis, dass dies der Fall sei.\n\nDer Abgeordnete Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) nannte w\u00e4hrend der Anh\u00f6rung Unstimmigkeiten zwischen den Aussagen von Mitgliedern der Familie Biden und den Aussagen von Bobulinski und Galanis als m\u00f6gliche Grundlage f\u00fcr eine weitere strafrechtliche Verweisung: L\u00fcgen gegen\u00fcber dem Kongress. Nach der Anh\u00f6rung verteidigte Palmer den Prozess des Oversight Committee und warnte, dass die Mitglieder noch Zeit h\u00e4tten, ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren in Betracht zu ziehen.\n\n\u201eIch denke, wir m\u00fcssen sehr \u00fcberlegt und sorgf\u00e4ltig vorgehen, denn es geht um das Leben vieler Menschen. Mein Ziel ist es nicht, jemanden zu erwischen, mein Ziel ist es, die Wahrheit herauszufinden\u201c, sagte Palmer.\n\nDie Anh\u00f6rung wurde zeitweise sehr kontrovers gef\u00fchrt. Als die Abgeordnete Lisa C. McClain versuchte, den Ruf von Hunter Biden zu schm\u00e4lern, indem sie ihn sp\u00f6ttisch als \u201egoldenes Kind\u201c bezeichnete, lachte die Abgeordnete Ayanna Pressley und murmelt, dass McClains Kommentar \u201ereich\u201c sei. \u201eSchauen Sie sich Ihre Partei an\u201c, f\u00fcgte Pressley hinzu. \u201eG\u00f6nnen Sie mir eine Pause.\u201c\n\nAn einem Punkt forderte der Abgeordnete Jared Moskowitz Comer auf, einen Antrag auf ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren gegen Biden zu stellen. \u201eWann k\u00f6nnen wir dem amerikanischen Volk sagen, dass Sie aufh\u00f6ren werden, Ihr Geld zu verschwenden und einfach die Abstimmung \u00fcber ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren beantragen?\u201c, sagte Moskowitz.\n\n\u201eWir machen keine Schnellabstimmungen wie ihr\u201c, entgegnete der Vorsitzende des Justizausschusses Jim Jordan.\n\nDemokraten bezichtigen die Republikaner der L\u00fcge\n\nMehrere Demokraten warfen den Republikanern vor, eine Anh\u00f6rung zu einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren abzuhalten, das zum Teil auf der Grundlage einer Behauptung eingeleitet wurde, von der die Beh\u00f6rden inzwischen sagen, sie sei unwahr. Der Sonderstaatsanwalt David Weiss, der zuvor Strafanzeige gegen Hunter Biden erstattet hatte, k\u00fcndigte im vergangenen Monat eine Anklage gegen einen FBI-Informanten an, dessen Behauptungen Comer als grundlegendes Beweisst\u00fcck in der Amtsenthebungsuntersuchung angepriesen hatte, weil er angeblich das FBI angelogen hatte.\n\nComer und Senator Chuck Grassley hatten im vergangenen Fr\u00fchjahr unbegr\u00fcndete Behauptungen von Alexander Smirnow - einer ehemaligen vertraulichen Quelle des FBI - aus dem Jahr 2020 aufgedeckt, wonach Biden in ein Bestechungsprogramm verwickelt gewesen sei, und das FBI aufgefordert, das Dokument mit Smirnows Behauptungen vorzulegen. Die von Smirnov erhobenen Behauptungen wurden zuvor vom FBI unter dem damaligen Generalstaatsanwalt William P. Barr gepr\u00fcft und f\u00fcr nicht stichhaltig befunden und anschlie\u00dfend fallen gelassen.\n\nComer und andere Republikaner im Kongress argumentierten jedoch monatelang, dass Smirnovs Behauptungen ein Beweis daf\u00fcr seien, dass die Bidens in korrupte Gesch\u00e4fte verwickelt gewesen seien, und dass das FBI diesen Behauptungen nicht nachgegangen sei. Die Saga fand in den Medien gro\u00dfen Widerhall; Sean Hannitys Show auf Fox News strahlte mindestens 85 Beitr\u00e4ge \u00fcber die unbegr\u00fcndete Behauptung aus, Biden habe eine Bestechung angenommen, so eine Aufstellung von Media Matters for America.\n\n\u201eDiese gesamte Untersuchung basiert auf einer bahnbrechenden Information, die sich in einem geheimen SCIF-Raum befand, und in diesem Raum befand sich ein Dokument, das Pr\u00e4sident Biden direkt eines 10-Millionen-Dollar-Bestechungsschemas bezichtigte\u201c, sagte Abgeordnete Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201eWas ist vor einem Monat passiert? Das FBI verhaftete die Person, die diese Anschuldigungen vorbrachte, weil sie ihre Aussage gegen\u00fcber dem FBI gef\u00e4lscht hatte. Das gesamte Amtsenthebungsverfahren basiert auf einer tats\u00e4chlich nachweisbaren Person, die gelogen hat.\u201c\n\nWas haben russische Agenten mit dem Verfahren gegen Biden zu tun?\n\nDie Demokraten befragten auch Lev Parnas, einen ehemaligen Mitarbeiter von Rudy Giuliani, der in einem Fall von Wahlkampf-Finanzbetrug verurteilt wurde und am Mittwoch erschien, \u00fcber seine Zeit der Zusammenarbeit mit Giuliani in den Jahren 2018 und 2019, um sch\u00e4dliche Informationen \u00fcber Joe Biden aufzusp\u00fcren. Der ukrainisch-amerikanische Gesch\u00e4ftsmann rief die Kohorte von Pro-Trump-Gesetzgebern auf den Plan, die Fehlinformationen \u00fcber die Bidens und ihre Arbeit in der Ukraine verbreiteten.\n\n\u201eDie einzigen Informationen, die jemals \u00fcber die Bidens und die Ukraine verbreitet wurden, stammen aus einer Quelle und nur aus einer Quelle: Russland und russischen Agenten\u201c, sagte Parnas aus.\n\nAm Ende der Anh\u00f6rung sagte Comer, er lade den Pr\u00e4sidenten ein, vor dem Kongress auszusagen, eine Einladung, die ein Sprecher des Wei\u00dfen Hauses in den sozialen Medien mit einem Lachen quittierte.\n\nZur Autorin Jacqueline Alemany ist Reporterin f\u00fcr Kongressuntersuchungen bei The Washington Post.

            "text": "United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain testified to a Senate committee on March 14 that a four-day workweek would benefit his members and millions of other workers.\n\nG. Roger King, a lawyer with the lobbying organization for big corporate human resources officers, assured the members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that he and his colleagues were fully on board with the concept of a four-day work week.\n\nHis HR colleagues, he told the senators at a March 14 hearing, are \u201cnot opposed to 32-hour work weeks or other nontraditional work week configurations\u201d ... in principle.\n\nUnfortunately, he said, a four-day week would only exacerbate existing labor shortages, would be a \u201cbackdoor\u201d increase in the minimum wage, and in any case should be driven by \u201ctraditional market forces,\u201d not mandated by federal law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen my members look back on their lives, they never say \u2018I wish I had worked more.\u2019 ... They say, \u2018I wish I had more time.\u2019 \u2014 United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain\n\nAre you surprised that big employers would fight a shorter work week for their employees? Me neither.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule,\u201d says labor historian Erik Loomis of the University of Rhode Island, \u201cemployers are opposed to every labor reform. They always say it\u2019s going to be a disaster for the economy, and it never is.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner. Enter email address Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThat\u2019s been true of every increase in the minimum wage, and it was true of the last government-mandated contraction of the workweek \u2014 the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the minimum wage, banned child labor in factories and mandated an eight-hour workday and 40-hour workweek, after which rank-and-file workers are entitled to time-and-a-half pay.\n\nThe workweek is now back on the front burner, in part because unions are feeling their oats lately, and also because Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the HELP Committee chairman, has introduced a bill to mandate a 32-hour workweek with no loss of pay for those transitioning from the traditional 40 hours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a result of the extraordinary technological transformations that we have seen in recent years, American workers are now over 400% more productive than they were in the 1940s,\u201d Sanders said in opening the hearing. \u201cAlmost all of the economic gains of that technological transformation have gone straight to the top, while wages for workers have remained stagnant, or even worse.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. Rank-and-file worker wages have barely kept up with inflation, while CEO pay has rocketed into the stratosphere. In 1965, the average chief executive\u2019s pay at the 350 largest U.S. companies was about 20 times the average wage of their rank-and-file workers, according to the labor-affiliated Economic Policy Institute. In 2022, it was 344.5 times as much.\n\nWhat paid for that run-up in executive pay was a massive increase in U.S. worker productivity. But as Sanders observed, the average worker received barely a taste of the gains.\n\nAs for King\u2019s hand-wringing about a \u201cbackdoor\u201d increase in the minimum wage, would that it were so. The federal minimum wage was last raised in 2009, to $7.25 per hour from $6.55. Since then, Congress hasn\u2019t mustered the votes for a further increase while the wage has been devastated by inflation.\n\nThe value of the wage in 2022 dollars peaked at $13.46 in 1968, when the nominal wage was $1.60. In other words, the hourly wage of workers earning the federal minimum has been cut almost in half in the last 56 years.\n\nViewing the four-day workweek exclusively as an employer cost is the wrong way to think about it, however. Indications are that it can be a boon to employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPilot programs in the U.S., Europe, South Africa and Brazil have found that worker productivity rises \u2014 in other words, employers get more out of their workers for the same pay.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, according to Boston College sociologist Juliet Schor, who studied pilot programs established by the nonprofit 4 Day Week Global, more than two-thirds of workers showed less job burnout; anxiety and fatigue declined for 40%; and 60% reported more success achieving a work-family balance. Almost every participant wanted to continue the program.\n\n\u201cWorkers tell us about improvements in mental and physical health, ability to spend time with family, and finally getting a chance for time for themselves,\u201d Schor told the HELP Committee. The changes persisted through the end of the yearlong study period.\n\nBusiness Column: American unions have finally remembered how to win The UAW\u2019s great new contracts with GM, Stellantis and Ford show that union solidarity and concrete goals bring major victories for workers for the first time in decades.\n\nMore than 90% of the 202 companies in Schor\u2019s sample continued the program past the one-year mark. And why not? Among the U.S. and Canadian companies in the sample, turnover fell by more than 20% and absenteeism by 39%.\n\nNone of that might stem the knee-jerk opposition to the four-day week among businesses and their water carriers on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cA 32-hour workweek with no loss in pay? Who wouldn\u2019t want this?\u201d asked Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the ranking Republican on Sanders\u2019 committee. \u201cBut unfortunately, we live in reality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCassidy did the raw math and declared that \u201cthe government mandating a 32-hour workweek while requiring businesses to increase pay at least an extra 25% per hour of labor will destroy employers, forcing them to either ship jobs overseas or dramatically increase prices to try and stay afloat.\u201d Naturally, he blamed President Biden: \u201cThe Biden administration has been dumping gasoline on his inflation fire. This would be napalm.\u201d\n\nCassidy talked as though Americans\u2019 average workweek derived from some sort of immutable law that could be tampered with only at our economic peril.\n\nThat\u2019s nonsense. On average, American workers spend 400 more hours on the job per year than Germans \u2014 that works out to about 1\u00bd hours more per working day. Americans work 200 hours a year more than workers in France, the Netherlands and Britain, Schor testified.\n\nThe result, she said, is \u201cextraordinary levels of stress, burnout and exhaustion for American workers.\u201d\n\nCassidy also called the four-day workweek a \u201cfringe proposal.\u201d But it\u2019s nothing of the kind. A 32-hour, four-day workweek has been talked about for decades. Even Richard Nixon, as vice president in 1956, said he foresaw a four-day workweek \u201cin the not too distant future.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Nixon made his prediction as a way to boast about economic growth under Eisenhower and make the case that the Democratic presidential candidate, Adlai Stevenson, would institute policies that would hobble the \u201cunbelievably prosperous\u201d future that would unfold in a second Eisenhower term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it happens, by the time Nixon entered the White House on his own in 1969, he was no longer promising a four-day week.\n\nHistory tells us that employers always view changes in work conditions to benefit workers as unimaginably radical \u2014 \u201cfringe\u201d proposals, to use Cassidy\u2019s term.\n\nThat was the case in the 1870s and 1880s, when the eight-hour day became the rallying cry for the Knights of Labor, the first truly national industrial labor union.\n\nThe eight-hour campaign contributed to the Knights\u2019 massive expansion, which in turn fostered a misimpression that it could launch and win a strike against the railroad network controlled by financier Jay Gould.\n\nBut Gould outmaneuvered the union leadership into reaching a settlement with major union concessions. The strike collapsed, followed by the Knights themselves.\n\nThe eight-hour day came off the front burner. A major restructuring of the workweek didn\u2019t occur until 1914, when Henry Ford shocked the nation\u2019s industrial establishment by instituting a $5 daily wage at his factories \u2014 along with a cut in the workday to eight hours from nine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee turnover fell and factory productivity soared, in part because Ford could now run three shifts instead of two, which enabled him to fill more orders for his popular mass-market Model T.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a shift to a four-day, 32-hour week will cause some disruption in the employment world; Sanders\u2019 bill would provide for a four-year transition period.\n\nAmong the important but often overlooked considerations yet to be worked out, Loomis says, is the impact on service workers. As white-collar and industrial workers receive an extra day of leisure, demand for services will obviously increase.\n\n\u201cIt makes a ton of sense for the white-collar class and traditional factory workers,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut what needs to be worked out is how it will affect the service sector, where there\u2019s already a shortage of workers. Where do those workers come from? Do they get a 32-hour week?\u201d Increased pay would be likely, Loomis says \u2014 \u201cthey would have even more power to fight for higher wages.\u201d\n\nAnother source would be immigrants by reopening the border. That\u2019s impossible just now, because border politics have lost any semblance of sanity.\n\n\u201cEven today, the service economy is an afterthought,\u201d Loomis says. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, given the reality of what the labor market actually looks like today.\u201d If the advent of a four-day week prompts policymakers to pay attention to this all-important sector, that wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt looks as if the American labor movement is beginning to take on the four-day workweek as its cause for the present day.\n\n\u201cWhen my members look back on their lives,\u201d United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain told Sanders\u2019 committee, \u201cthey never say \u2018I wish I had worked more.\u2019\u201d They never say, \u2018I wish I\u2019d made more money.\u2019 They say, \u2018I wish I had more time.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaying for it means directing more of the productivity gains that have fattened top executives and Wall Street financiers to the working class.\n\nFain is right to cast the goal of a four-day workweek in the context of economic inequality. \u201cWe know with technology, we can do more with less,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the mantra we hear from management every day, and yet it never benefits the worker.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cThose who profit off of the labor of others have all the time in the world. While those who make this country run, who build the products and contribute the labor, have less and less time for themselves, for their families, and for their lives.\u201d",

            "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congress released the final six government funding bills early Thursday, starting off a sprint toward the Friday midnight deadline to wrap up work that was supposed to be finished nearly six months ago.\n\nThe bipartisan agreement on the $1.2 trillion spending package, which emerged just before 3 a.m., came less than two weeks after the U.S. House and Senate approved the other six annual appropriations bills.\n\nThis package includes the spending measures for some of the most crucial functions of the federal government \u2014 the departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, State and Treasury.\n\n\n\nThe bill would also fund Congress, the Executive Office of the President, the judiciary and the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe 1,012-page spending package provides money for hundreds of programs, including many that lawmakers will tout on the campaign trail heading toward the November elections. Included:\n\nU.S. troops and civilian Defense Department employees will receive a 5.2% pay raise retroactive to Jan. 1, 2024.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s new headquarters project \u2014 which has not only divided Democrats and Republicans, but the congressional delegations from Virginia and Maryland \u2014 will receive $200 million for construction on the Greenbelt, Maryland, site via the General Services Administration.\n\nStates will get $55 million in new Election Security Grant funding.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection as well as Immigrations and Customs Enforcement will get more than $4 billion in funding increases.\n\nChild care and early learning programs at the Department of Health and Human Services will receive a $1 billion increase in funding. The boost will go toward the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which provides grants to state, territorial and tribal agencies, and Head Start, which provides funding to local grantees.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police will receive a 7.8% funding increase.\n\nAfghans who assisted the United States during the war would be eligible for an additional 12,000 Special Immigrant Visas.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, the primary aid organization in Gaza, would be stripped of U.S. funding after Israel accused agency employees of taking part in Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nWeekend work possible\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday morning the package clears \u201canother hurdle towards our ultimate goal of funding the federal government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis funding agreement between the White House and Congressional leaders is good news that comes in the nick of time: When passed it will extinguish any more shutdown threats for the rest of the fiscal year, it will avoid the scythe of budget sequestration and it will keep the government open without cuts or poison pill riders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now the job of the House Republican leadership to move this package ASAP.\u201d\n\nAfter the House votes to approve the package, likely Friday, Schumer said, \u201cthe Senate will need bipartisan cooperation to pass it before Friday\u2019s deadline and avoid a shutdown.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday during a press conference he expected senators would be in session this weekend to take final votes on the package.\n\n\u201cMy assumptions and what I\u2019ve told our members is we\u2019re likely to be here this weekend. That will be determined, however, by how long it stays in the House,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n\u201cAnd when it\u2019s over here, what we have recently done \u2014 and I think hopefully will work again \u2014 is that in return for a certain number of amendments, we can finish it quicker, hopefully, than putting us in the position of shutting down the government,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said in a written statement the package would claw back $20.2 billion from the Internal Revenue Service funding that Democrats included in their signature climate change and tax package and $6 billion in unused COVID-19 funds.\n\nOn immigration, the funding package \u201ccuts funding to NGOs that incentivize illegal immigration and increases detention capacity and the number of Border Patrol Agents to match levels in the House-passed appropriations bill and the Secure the Border Act (H.R. 2),\u201d he said, referring to non-governmental organizations.\n\nThe package also includes funding for the nation\u2019s defense. \u201cThis FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission while expanding support for our brave men and women who serve in uniform,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cImportantly, it halts funding for the United Nations agency which employed terrorists who participated in the October 7 attacks against Israel.\u201d\n\nMore than $1B to reduce child care costs\n\nSenate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said in a written statement that she was \u201cproud to have secured $1 billion more to lower families\u2019 child care costs and help them find pre-K \u2014 a critical investment to help tackle the child care crisis that is holding families and our economy back.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom day one of this process, I said there would be no extreme, far-right riders to restrict women\u2019s reproductive freedoms \u2014 and there aren\u2019t,\u201d Murray said. \u201cDemocrats stood firm to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose in these negotiations and focused on delivering investments that matter to working people.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, Murray said, \u201cdefeated outlandish cuts that would have been a gut punch for American families and our economy \u2014 and we fought off scores of extreme policies that would have restricted Americans\u2019 fundamental freedoms, hurt consumers while giving giant corporations an unfair advantage, and turned back the clock on historic climate action.\u201d\n\nThe House and Senate must debate and approve the measure in less than two days under the stopgap funding agreement, otherwise a weekend funding lapse would begin. If it went on beyond the brief period of the weekend, a partial government shutdown would begin.\n\nThe House can easily hold a vote within that timeline, but the Senate will need to reach agreement among all 100 of its members in order to avoid casting votes past that benchmark.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at where Congress increased funding and where it cut spending on these six government funding bills for fiscal year 2024, which began back on Oct. 1.\n\nDefense\n\nCongress plans to spend $824.5 billion on the Defense spending bill, which predominantly funds the Pentagon, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThat bill includes funding for a 5.2% pay raise for military and civilian defense employees that will be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2024. The basic allowance for housing will increase by 5.4% and the basic allowance for sustenance will increase by 1.7%.\n\nThat total spending level would be divvied up among several core programs, including $176.2 billion for military personnel, an increase of $3.5 billion; $287.2 billion for operations and maintenance, $9.1 billion above current levels; $172 billion for procurement of military equipment, $9.8 billion more than the enacted level; and $148.3 billion for research and development, an $8.6 billion increase, according to a House GOP summary and a summary from House Democrats.\n\nThe Israeli Cooperative Missile Defense Programs would get $300 million for research and testing as well as $200 million for procurement, including for the Iron Dome and David\u2019s Sling. An additional $300 million would go toward the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.\n\nSenate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, said in a statement the bill \u201cwill invest in our ability to stay ahead of the threat of China, defend our country from foreign adversaries while standing firm with America\u2019s allies, and take care of our servicemembers and their families.\u201d\n\nThe joint explanatory statement that accompanies the bill calls on the Department of Defense to look into why the military is having difficulty recruiting.\n\n\u201cThe Military Services are in the midst of one of the greatest recruiting crises since the creation of the all-volunteer force,\u201d it says. \u201cSince retention of enlisted servicemembers remains strong, those who continue to serve will promote to more senior grades, leaving a distressing shortfall in junior enlisted servicemembers, who account for 40 percent of the total active U.S. military force. The Nation needs America\u2019s youth to strongly consider uniformed service.\u201d\n\nThe package calls on the Defense Department to \u201cconduct an independent survey to better understand the failure of recruitment efforts by the services,\u201d according to House Republicans\u2019 summary of the bill.\n\nThe secretary of Defense must also brief the Defense Appropriations subcommittees on a proposal to increase the pay for junior enlisted troops.\n\nFinancial Services and General Government\n\nThe Financial Services and General Government bill \u2014 which funds the U.S. Treasury Department, Executive Office of the President, judiciary and more than two dozen smaller programs \u2014 would receive $26.1 billion in funding. That\u2019s about $1.1 billion below the current funding levels for those programs.\n\nSenate FSGG Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said in a written statement the \u201cbipartisan legislation invests in these critical priorities for our nation and more \u2014 including providing key resources to tackle the opioid epidemic and the necessary funding to build the new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt, Maryland.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuilding an economy that works for everyday Americans requires supporting our small businesses and community-based lenders, protecting consumers, building out our broadband infrastructure, and ensuring the security of our financial system,\u201d Van Hollen said.\n\nThe Department of Treasury would receive $14.2 billion, a $22.9 million reduction to its current funding levels. Of that total funding level, $12.3 billion would go to the Internal Revenue Service, equal to its current funding, and $158 million would go toward the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, according to a bill summary from House Democrats.\n\nThe Judiciary would get more than $8.6 billion to operate the U.S. courts, including the District Courts, Courts of Appeals and other judicial services. That funding level is an increase of nearly $170 million.\n\nIt provides $129 million for salaries and expenses of the U.S. Supreme Court and $20 million to care for the building and its grounds, according to the joint explanatory statement.\n\nThe bill includes $791 million in funding for the District of Columbia, a decrease of $1 million. That includes $40 million in residential tuition support, $30 million in emergency and security costs, $8 million in upgrades to sewer and water treatment and $4 million in HIV/AIDS testing and treatment, according to a bill summary from House Democrats.\n\nThe Executive Office of the President would receive about $872.5 million \u2014 a $6 million decrease from the 2023 fiscal level, according to a bill summary from Democrats.\n\nThat includes $114 million for the Office of Administration, $19 million for the National Security Council, $22 million for the Office of National Cyber Director and $457 million for the National Drug Control Policy.\n\nThe bill would provide the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission with about $151 million in funding, a decrease of $1.5 million. The bill bars CPSC from issuing a ban on gas stoves, \u201cwhich would reduce consumer choice,\u201d according to a House GOP bill summary.\n\nThat policy provision would prohibit CPSC from \u201cpromulgating, implementing, administering, or enforcing any regulation to ban gas stoves as a class of products,\u201d according to the explanatory statement.\n\nCPSC has not made any regulatory action to ban gas stoves. Agency officials have expressed concern about indoor air quality of gas stoves and the agency is researching the impacts on human health of those indoor gas emissions.\n\nThe Election Assistance Commission would receive a cut of $280,000 in funding for a total level of $27.7 million.\n\nA total of $55 million from that allocation would go toward Election Security Grants \u201cto make payments to states for activities to improve the administration of elections for Federal office, including to enhance election technology and make election security improvements,\u201d according to the explanatory statement.\n\nHomeland Security\n\nCongress plans to spend $62 billion on the Department of Homeland Security, including upgrading technology to screen for narcotics like fentanyl at U.S. ports of entry and an additional $495 million in funding to hire 22,000 border patrol agents.\n\nThe bill provides U.S. Customs and Border Protection with $19 billion, a $3 billion increase above current levels, and more than $9.6 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, an increase of $1.1 billion.\n\nIt puts in place policy requirements for detention centers, such as barring contracts with private companies that do not meet inspection standards, and providing an additional $3 million to expand the use of ICE body cameras, according to the explanatory statement.\n\nThe legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to publish data on the 15th of every month on the total detention capacity and the number of \u201cgot aways\u201d and people \u201cturned back\u201d at the southern border, according to the joint explanatory statement.\n\nDHS refers to people as \u201cgot aways\u201d when an individual is observed making an unauthorized entry into the U.S. and is not turned away, or apprehended. That data is not publicly available.\n\nThe Office of the Secretary and Executive Management would get $404 million, an increase of about $20 million. About $30 million of that funding would go \u201cto support the safe reunification of families who were unjustly separated at the U.S.-Mexico border by the Trump Administration,\u201d according to House Democrats\u2019 summary of the bill.\n\nThe bill provides $5.1 billion for Enforcement and Removal Operations, an increase of $900 million above current funding. Of that, $355 million would go toward 41,500 detention beds.\n\nThe bill would appropriate $11.8 billion for the U.S. Coast Guard, a $122.7 million boost; $10.6 billion for the Transportation Security Administration, an increase of $1.2 billion; and $25.3 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a funding cut of $72.9 million.\n\nThe FEMA funding would go toward several projects, with $20 billion of those funds for disaster relief.\n\nLabor-HHS-Education\n\nThe bill would appropriate $13.7 billion for the Labor Department, $145 million less than current funding levels and $79 billion for the Education Department, a cut of $500 million, according to the House GOP summary.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department would get $116.8 billion, or about $3.9 billion less than the $120.7 billion provided during the last fiscal year. The House Democrats\u2019 summary of the bill, however, says that when earmarks are factored into the total spending level, HHS would get a $955 million increase.\n\nSenate Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee Chair Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, said in a written statement the bill \u201chelps take on the fentanyl and opioid crisis, expand access to affordable child care, invest in critical mental health and affordable health care programs, and connect Americans with the education and workforce training they need to land good-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nFunding for HHS would go to numerous health programs, including a $300 million increase to the National Institutes of Health for a total spending level of $48.6 billion.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would get $9.2 billion, more than $4.5 million above its current funding level.\n\nTitle X family planning grants would get $286 million in funding, the same amount they currently receive, despite House Republicans proposing to completely eliminate the program.\n\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, a central component of the nation\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the mpox outbreak, would get $3.6 billion, a $5 million increase.\n\nOf that total spending level, $1 billion would go toward the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and $980 million would go to the Strategic National Stockpile. That represents an increase of $65 million and $15 million, respectively.\n\nThe bill includes a $1 billion increase in funding for child care and early learning programs within HHS, according to Senate Democrats\u2019 summary of the legislation.\n\nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant would see a $725 million, 9%, increase in funding compared to current levels, for a total appropriation of $8.8 billion. Another $12.27 billion would go toward Head Start programs, a boost of $275 million over the current level.\n\n\u201cSustained annual increases to our federal investments in child care and Head Start are critical in tackling the child care crisis and helping to ensure more families can find and afford the quality, affordable child care and early childhood education options they need,\u201d Senate Democrats\u2019 summary says. \u201cWith the new investments provided in this bill, annual discretionary funding for CCDBG and Head Start over the last three fiscal years has increased by $4.4 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s spending would go to numerous initiatives, including $24.6 billion for student financial aid programs.\n\nPell Grants, which go to about 7 million lower-income college students, would continue to have a maximum award of $7,395 during the 2024-2025 academic year. The Federal Work Study program for college students would also get equal funding at $1.2 billion.\n\nThe Labor-HHS-Education bill continues to include the so-called Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding from being used for abortions with exceptions for rape, incest, or the life of the pregnant person.\n\nThe decades-old provision, first added in the 1970s in a slightly different form, affects patients in federal health care programs like Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nSimilar provisions on abortion access exist throughout many of the other government funding bills.\n\nLegislative Branch\n\nThe Legislative Branch Appropriations bill includes $6.75 billion for operations in the Capitol, including funding related to the summer\u2019s party conventions and the presidential inauguration in January 2025.\n\nThe bill would boost funding for the U.S. Capitol Police to $792 million, a 7.8% increase from fiscal 2023.\n\nThe measure includes funding for retention and recruitment programs of Capitol Police officers, including student loan payments and tuition reimbursements. Capitol Police officers, the force responsible for security at the Capitol complex, reported lower morale in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\u201cThis is an essential investment in democracy and oversight that bolsters the legislative branch\u2019s capacity to better serve the public,\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. \u201cThis bill delivers the funding and infrastructure required for the U.S. Capitol Police to safeguard the Capitol complex and keep it accessible to the public.\u201d\n\nA joint explanatory statement accompanying the bill says the measure would allow $2 million for Capitol Police to protect members of Congress outside the Capitol complex but within the Washington, D.C., region. Members have experienced increased threats in recent years.\n\nThe measure also includes funding for quadrennial events related to the presidential election.\n\nCapitol Police would receive $3.2 million for overtime to support the national political conventions \u2014 Republicans\u2019 in Milwaukee and Democrats\u2019 in Chicago \u2014 over the summer and to prepare for the inauguration in January.\n\nInauguration Day is in the next fiscal year, which begins in October, but expenses associated with preparing for it could be incurred this year. The bill would allocate nearly $3.7 million for salaries and expenses associated with the inauguration.\n\nThe bill would provide $16.6 million for Capitol grounds, House and Senate offices and the Capitol Power Plant.\n\nThe measure includes a provision that would claw back unspent funds from members\u2019 Representational Allowances, the accounts that reimburse senators and representatives for official expenses. Unspent funds from those accounts would be used to pay down the national debt.\n\nThe measure includes a longstanding policy freezing members\u2019 pay.\n\nState-Foreign Operations\n\nCongress plans to allocate just over $58.3 billion for the Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development and other related programs, including refugee emergency assistance and diplomatic activities.\n\nRepublican lawmakers are touting an overall cut to the bill \u2014 down from last year\u2019s $59.7 billion total.\n\nThe bill includes $11.8 billion for the U.S. State Department and USAID and $10.3 billion for international development, including a loan to the International Monetary Fund to provide economic relief for some of the world\u2019s poorest nations.\n\nThe bill allocates $10 billion for global health initiatives that focus on combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, as well as providing vaccination programs for children.\n\nOf that health funding, Democrats cheered that the bill \u201cprotects longstanding funding,\u201d as highlighted by Murray\u2019s office, for family planning and reproductive health services in poor nations around the globe, for which nearly $524 million is allocated, remaining at the same level as the current spending level.\n\nFunding appropriated to the president for multilateral assistance to international organizations and programs \u2014 ranging from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to programs for victims of torture \u2014 is set to drop to $436.9 million from last year\u2019s funding level of $508.6 million.\n\nThat reduction, in part, reflects current political tension over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAbsent from the bill are funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, a primary humanitarian organization in the Palestinian Gaza Strip and West bank territories. Many Western nations cut UNRWA funding after Israel accused 13 of its employees of taking part in the Oct. 7 attacks and many more of sympathizing with Hamas and other militant groups. The agency received $75 million from the U.S. in fiscal year 2023.\n\nAnother notable absence from the bill is funding for the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, which received $17.5 million from the U.S. in last year\u2019s funding bill.\n\nRepublicans celebrated the elimination of funding for the agency\u2019s inquiry into human rights abuses in Palestinian territories, which the UN Human Rights Council opened after a flare up of violence in May 2021. The inquiry began to collect evidence of war crimes \u201ccommitted by all sides\u201d shortly after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 and taking roughly 240 hostages.\n\nThe bill will meet the annual U.S. $3.3 billion commitment to Israel this year among the $8.9 billion in security assistance to foreign governments.\n\nThe funding roadmap for U.S. international activities extends several programs, notably authorizing an additional 12,000 Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. during its war in Afghanistan.\n\n",

            "text": "The U.S. Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the U.S. government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.\n\nThe complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that \u201dApple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,\u201d he added.\n\nThe long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling \u2013 and in some cases, restricting \u2013 how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth\u2019s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.\n\nThe company said it denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d\n\nBut Garland on Thursday said Apple\u2019s actions have wide-ranging effects.\n\n\u201cMonopolies like Apple\u2019s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,\u201d Garland said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there\u2019s a law for that,\u201d he added.\n\nFor example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message \u2013 but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.\n\nThe company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors\u2019 products are far more limited in their capabilities.\n\n\u201cApple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,\u201d Garland said on Thursday.\n\n\u2018We will vigorously defend against it\u2019\n\nThis year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.\n\nAnd Apple maintains a 30 per cent commission on most sales through its app store \u2013 a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple\u2019s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\n\nThursday\u2019s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.\n\nApple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2013 designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\u201d the company said in its statement. \u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\u201d\n\nYears of scrutiny\n\nApple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple\u2019s practices.\n\nThe case represents the Biden administration\u2019s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under U.S. antitrust law.\n\nApple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.\n\nThe legal action could weigh on Apple\u2019s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell 3 per cent Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.\n\nAlong with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.\n\nThe Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden\u2019s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.\n\nAlong with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.\n\nApps vs Apple\n\nTo solve Android phone customers\u2019 \u201cgreen bubble\u201d issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.\n\n\u201cIt lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,\u201d Migicovsky said. \u201cTechnologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.\u201d\n\nThose kind of interactions have made Apple\u2019s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.\n\nBeginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game \u201cFortnite.\u201d\n\nApple isn\u2019t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.\n\nThose rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don\u2019t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.\n\nEurope\u2019s bite at Apple\n\nThe U.S. government isn\u2019t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.\n\nIn a seismic move to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.\n\nBut critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.\n\nUpstart turned behemoth\n\nSince its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It\u2019s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple\u2019s restrictiveness.\n\nIn the era led by founder Steve Jobs, \u201cApple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,\u201d said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. \u201cApple relentlessly innovated. They were always steps ahead of the competition.\u201d\n\nNow, however, Apple\u2019s advances are more \u201cincremental\u201d than earth-shattering, Bailey added. \u201c[CEO Tim] Cook has been focused on financial management and expanding market share.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s financially healthy,\u201d Bailey said, but their reputation for innovation is \u201cdimming.\u201d",

            "text": "President Biden is using the anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to bash former President Donald Trump\u2019s record on health care and capitalize on his threat to repeal the law.\n\nIn a new digital ad released Friday ahead of the 14thth On the anniversary of the law\u2019s enactment, the Biden campaign sought to highlight Trump\u2019s repeated threats to repeal it and emphasize the consequences if he wins a second term.\n\nThe video, titled \u201cFlatline,\u201d includes audio of Trump criticizing Obamacare, with on-screen text detailing what would happen if the law was repealed.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump tried to take away our health care,\u201d the ad read. \u201cHe failed. But he comes back for it.\u201d\n\nThe message is played over a heart monitor image that eventually flattens out.\n\nAs president, Trump is one vote away from repealing the law and has said he would like to try again.\n\n\u201cIf he succeeds\u202645 million Americans could lose their health insurance,\u201d the ad said. \u201cAnd you just might be one of them.\u201d\n\nThe campaign says the ads will air across battleground states in English and Spanish on digital platforms including Meta, YouTube and connected TV.\n\nIn addition to the ad, the campaign will hold a digital rally this weekend featuring former President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The nationwide appeal is aimed at \u201cmobilizing supporters and volunteers to protect the ACA from President Trump\u2019s attacks,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is also running digital ads in battleground states denouncing President Trump\u2019s efforts to repeal the ACA.\n\nThe ads will be displayed on local newspaper websites in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin, which will be carried over to digital homepages.\n\nThe Biden campaign and its Democratic allies are eager to take on President Trump over Obamacare after the Republican nominee resurfaces with a view to repealing the law.\n\nMore than 40 million people have health insurance through Obamacare, and this law is more popular than ever. Biden campaign officials believe maintaining the system is a key political challenge as press requests reach a record high of 21.3 million in 2024.\n\nBiden and Democrats have long felt that health care is a win-win issue for them, and the president has turned to the pocketbook of cutting payroll costs amid broader concerns about the economy.\n\n\u201cWe cannot take this progress for granted. Extreme MAGA Republicans have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times. Just this week, President Trump\u2019s allies in the House of Representatives has proposed a budget that guts this lifesaving bill,\u201d Biden said in a statement Friday, referring to the Republican Study Committee\u2019s budget proposal.\n\n\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that millions of people will have affordable health care in November. I will repel the attacks of MAGA Republicans and make health care in America a right, not a privilege. We are more determined than ever to do so,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe Biden campaign is also trying to capitalize on President Trump\u2019s \u201cam I better\u201d argument.\n\nOn Friday, Biden\u2019s team highlighted a clip from a press conference held at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic exactly four years ago. At the time, President Trump said he wanted to \u201cend\u201d Obamacare and reiterated his support for a lawsuit seeking to repeal the law. .\n\n\u201cTaking health care coverage away from millions of Americans is always a bad idea, but President Trump\u2019s attempt in March 2020, when thousands of Americans were dying, could not have come at a worse time.\u201d said the camp. \u201cDonald Trump and his campaign continue to ask the country if we are better off today than we were four years ago. The answer, as we repeat, is yes.\u201d",

Democrats fear growing opposition at home could hurt his chances in November's presidential election.\n\nNetanyahu said in a statement after the call that he had reiterated \"Israel's commitment to achieving all of the war's objectives.\"\n\nThe Israeli premier cited the objectives as eliminating Hamas, release of all the hostages and \"ensuring that Gaza will never present a threat to Israel.\"\n\nHe also pointed to the provision of \"essential humanitarian aid that helps achieve these aims.\"\n\nIsrael began relentless bombardment in Gaza, alongside a ground offensive, after Palestinian militant group Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack, which left about 1,160 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized hostages, around 130 of whom Israel believes remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.\n\nNearly 32,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.\n\nAs tensions with Netanyahu escalated, Biden pointedly praised a \"good speech\" last week by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling for new elections in Israel.\n\nWith the UN warning of imminent famine in Gaza, Biden earlier this month ordered the US military to start airdrops of food into the enclave, and is sending American forces to build a temporary port for maritime aid.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nFani Willis, the embattled Fulton County District Attorney, plans to press ahead with her goal of putting Donald Trump on trial before the November election, and intends to ask the judge presiding over the Georgia criminal case to schedule a trial date as soon as this summer, according to three people familiar with her thinking.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold move considering the hurdles Willis faces in getting the case back on track after a two-month detour revealed embarrassing details of her personal life, damaging her credibility in the eyes of Judge Scott McAfee and leaving her politically vulnerable ahead of her own reelection bid in November.\n\nWillis narrowly avoided being disqualified over her romantic relationship with lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who resigned last Friday following a blistering rebuke from McAfee, publicly questioning both Wade and Willis\u2019s decision-making. On Wednesday McAfee granted requests from Trump and his co-defendants to seek an appeal, meaning the threat of disqualification still hangs over Willis.\n\nGeorgia Republicans continue to investigate allegations that Willis benefitted financially from her relationship with Wade. A state Senate committee could use its subpoena power to unearth new information and plans to meet several more times to hear from additional witnesses.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed changes into law that give a state commission the power to investigate Willis and authority to remove or sanction state prosecutors.\n\nWillis\u2019s rock-solid political standing has also been shaken. This month, Democrat Christian Wise Smith, a former Fulton County prosecutor and Atlanta solicitor, launched a campaign challenging Willis in the May 21 primary. Republican lawyer Courtney Kramer, an attorney who worked in the Office of the White House Counsel under Trump, has also joined the race.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Supreme Court\u2019s looming decision on whether the former president enjoys absolute immunity from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election subversion charges, one that could affect various criminal proceedings against Trump. Any ruling in favor of the former president from the high court could be a major blow to both criminal cases against Trump related to the 2020 election, including in Georgia. Hearings begin in April, with a decision expected by the end of June.\n\nSources close to the Fulton County DA\u2019s office say the uncertainty of the federal case does not prevent McAfee from setting a trial date. Fulton County prosecutors said in a recent email to defense attorneys they planned to respond to Trump\u2019s immunity claim within two weeks of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, according to a source familiar with the correspondence.\n\nProsecutors believe McAfee can put the immunity issue to the side until the Supreme Court rules while, in the interim, ensuring the Georgia case is as close to ready as possible if the justices decide Trump can be prosecuted, multiple sources familiar with the thinking inside Willis\u2019s office tell CNN.\n\nMultiple sources close to Willis acknowledge the last two months have been a major distraction, one they admit was brought on by her own actions but also enabled, they argue, by how much leeway McAfee gave defense attorneys to attack Willis during the disqualification proceedings.\n\n\u201cBasically, this is a two-month sideshow that the judge should have not even let happen,\u201d one Willis ally told CNN. \u201cBut it\u2019s over and the judge finally came to the right decision \u2026 and so now we\u2019re back to where we never should have left, which is these people were under felony indictment. Let\u2019s get a trial date.\u201d\n\nSources close to Willis tell CNN that the DA\u2019s office is effectively ready to go to trial. Willis has said she needs only 30 days to prepare once a date is set. Defense attorneys have had since September to review the evidence and prepare their own arguments.\n\nWillis had previously asked for a trial to start in August 2024. Sources tell CNN she plans to re-up the request now that she has survived the chaotic two months \u2013 which saw the entire Fulton County DA\u2019s office face disqualification and threatened to derail the entire case.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when Willis will make her second request of McAfee to set a trial date. The Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s office has declined to comment to CNN for this story.\n\nAshleigh Merchant, the defense attorney who led the effort to disqualify Willis, was asked by CNN\u2019s Laura Coates on Wednesday night if the defense was trying to delay the trial until after the upcoming 2024 election.\n\n\u201cI would very much like to go to trial,\u201d Merchant said, adding that the defense has a right for a \u201cfair and impartial\u201d prosecutor to evaluate the case. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen in this case,\u201d Merchant said.\n\nWillis and her team are aware of the political damage caused by the last two months but argue that their job is to prosecute the facts of the criminal case against Trump and his co-defendants, not worry about the political reverberations it causes.\n\nNathan Wade attends a hearing on February 27 in Atlanta. Brynn AndersonPool/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere was definitely damage done,\u201d said former Dekalb County District Attorney Robert James, who watches the case closely and told CNN that even if Willis can get the case to trial before November\u2019s election, picking a jury alone could take months, especially with so many defendants involved.\n\n\u201cUltimately some of the prospective jurors that watched those hearings have formed negative opinions of the DA and this case,\u201d said James. \u201cIt was always going to be difficult to get a fair and impartial jury. The hearing on the motion to disqualify just made it more difficult.\u201d\n\nOne source told CNN that Willis and her team realize the damage inflicted could diminish the public\u2019s perception of the Georgia case ahead of what is likely to be a polarizing 2024 election. But that person also betrayed a sense of anger over the spectacle that was made of the televised hearings.\n\n\u201cYou have people covering this, frankly, like it was sports or politics,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt deals with political activity, but there\u2019s not an election going on in court. There are elections going on, but not in court.\u201d\n\nJudge \u2018rolling up his sleeves\u2019\n\nSince his disqualification ruling, McAfee has indicated he is ready to continue moving forward, with sources familiar with the case saying he has asked attorneys on both sides about how to proceed with pre-trial motions.\n\nRecent communications from McAfee include questions about which motions needs oral argument and what needs more briefing before he can rule on them, one source told CNN.\n\nFulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images/File\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s rolling up his sleeves,\u201d one source said about McAfee.\n\nThat\u2019s not to discount the fallout from last week\u2019s 23-page opinion from McAfee, which amounted to a highly-critical rebuke of Willis\u2019s actions, describing her relationship with Wade being the result of \u201cbad choices.\u201d\n\nMcAfee wrote that Willis\u2019s comments at an Atlanta-area church in January about the case were \u201clegally improper.\u201d\n\nHe also warned of the potential for a future gag order against Willis, but said her church comments were far enough removed from a jury trial that it would not \u201cestablish a permanent taint of the jury pool.\u201d\n\nMichael Moore, a CNN legal analyst and former US attorney in Georgia, questions whether Willis should even remain on the case, and says if she does, she will need to show McAfee and the public that she is in complete \u201ccontrol.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no question that the progress of the case has been impeded by unnecessary speed bumps and detours,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe simply cannot afford another unforced error that results in additional unfavorable comments questioning her candor or judgment.\u201d",

It was not immediately clear if any of the money had been refunded.\n\nThe leadership PAC, Save America, spent more than $40 million on legal fees for him and many of his associates since the start of 2023.\n\nThe refund request was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump\u2019s team is creating a legal defense fund to help offset some of the enormous bills incurred amid a multitude of investigations into the former president.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith filed new charges on Thursday against the former president, his aide Walt Nauta and a third defendant, Carlos De Oliveira, in the case alleging Trump mishandled classified documents after leaving the White House.

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nMore than 100 Democratic Party and Biden donors recently signed a letter to the president warning him that if he doesn\u2019t change his Israel policy, he may lose re-election to former President Trump.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Tuesday that this letter includes signatures from several donors who have given \"six figure sums to Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2020 and 2024, though a preponderance of donors who signed the letter have given smaller amounts to candidates and causes more progressive than Mr. Biden.\"\n\nAmong these donors are David and Elizabeth Steinglass \u2013 who gave around $1.4 million to various party candidates and initiatives, environmentalist Caroline Gable \u2013 who has given $51,000 to Biden\u2019s 2024 campaign as well as $315,000 to the party this year, and George Krupp, who \"gave $1.2 million to Democrats in 2020 and has donated more than $600,000 to them during the 2024 election cycle,\" The Times stated.\n\nSCHUMER TRASHED FOR \u2018DISGUSTING\u2019 SPEECH CALLING ON ISRAEL TO DUMP NETANYAHU: \u2018OUTRAGEOUSLY INAPPROPRIATE\u2019\n\nThe Times also noted that Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign finance co-chair Paul Egerman was among the major signatories of the letter.\n\nTheir letter blasted the current president for supporting Israel\u2019s war effort in Gaza and the country\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIt stated, \"Regrettably President Biden has provided what appears to be unconditional support for the Israeli operation,\" it reads. \"The Biden administration has been providing armaments, including 2,000-pound bombs which have been used to flatten entire civilian neighborhoods, causing massive casualties with a high ratio of women and children.\"\n\nBiden has been somewhat critical of Israel\u2019s methods of waging war in Gaza in recent weeks, even expressing hope that Israel would arrange a ceasefire soon.\n\nThe letter acknowledged Biden\u2019s perspective but pointed out that it hasn\u2019t changed much at all. \"President Biden has asked Netanyahu to minimize civilian casualties but has threatened no consequences as Netanyahu has continued to ignore him.\"\n\nIt went on to grill Biden, arguing that his policy is alienating voters and thereby undermining the hefty contributions that these donors have given to his campaign and the party ahead of 2024.\n\nThe letter continued, \"As donors and activists, we have committed much time and treasure in helping increase the turnout of likely Biden voters, particularly among young voters and voters of color.\"\n\nSCHUMER'S ANTI-NETANYAHU SPEECH STRENGTHENS BIBI IN ISRAEL'S WAR TO DEFEAT HAMAS\n\n\"Many of these voters are now questioning whether the Democratic Party shares their values,\" it said, adding, \"If they stay home or vote for a third-party candidate, there is the very real danger that President Biden will be defeated in November.\"\n\nThe letter went on to mention how much of a \"disaster\" a second Trump administration would be \"for our country and a bigger disaster for Israel/Palestine.\"\n\n\"Because of the disillusionment of a critical portion of the Democratic coalition, the Gaza war is increasing the chances of a Trump victory,\" it declared.\n\nThis letter is just the latest written by prominent liberals criticizing Biden\u2019s pro-Israel stance. Last December, dozens of White House interns signed a letter demanding Biden to push for a cease-fire in Israel\u2019s war and slamming him and Vice President Harris for ignoring the \"pleas of the American people.\"\n\nMore than a dozen Biden campaign staffers sent their boss a letter in January pushing for a cease-fire as well.

            "text": "The Israeli PM has insisted that the operation to eliminate Hamas must go forward, regardless of US opposition\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to call off a major ground offensive against Hamas militants at the southern tip of the Gaza Strip, shrugging off a US warning that the operation will kill more civilians and worsen a humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave.\n\n\u201cWe have a disagreement with the Americans about the need to enter Rafah,\u201d Netanyahu told Israeli lawmakers on Tuesday, one day after US President Joe Biden urged him to cancel plans for storming Rafah. He added, \u201cWe do not see a way to eliminate Hamas militarily without destroying these remaining battalions. We are determined to do it.\u201d\n\nThe White House warned on Monday \u2013 after Biden\u2019s 45-minute telephone call with Netanyahu \u2013 that a major ground operation in Rafah \u201cwould be a mistake.\u201d Summing up the call, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters, \u201cIt would lead to more innocent civilian deaths, worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, deepen the anarchy in Gaza and further isolate Israel internationally.\u201d\n\nBiden had previously insisted that Israel provide a credible plan for preventing civilian casualties in Rafah before launching its offensive, but with rising political fallout over Palestinian civilian casualties, he has taken a tougher stance against Netanyahu. The US president expressed support on Friday for US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer after the lawmaker gave a speech arguing that Netanyahu had \u201clost his way\u201d and become an obstacle to peace in the region.\n\nThe war erupted when Hamas launched surprise raids against southern Israeli villages on October 7, killing more than 1,100 people and taking hundreds of hostages back to Gaza. Since then, more than 31,000 people have been killed in the besieged Palestinian enclave, according to local authorities, and around 1.5 million starving Gazans have been crammed into Rafah after Israeli bombardments leveled their neighborhoods.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced last week that displaced civilians will be moved to \u201chumanitarian islands\u201d north of Rafah before the ground offensive begins. Those refugees will provide temporary shelter, food and water, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said. Netanyahu approved the IDF\u2019s Rafah plan on Friday.\n\nHowever, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington still has not seen a \u201cclear and implementable plan\u201d to safeguard civilians in Rafah. He warned on Tuesday that 100% of Gaza\u2019s residents are suffering \u201csevere levels of acute food insecurity. That\u2019s the first time an entire population has been so classified.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu has claimed that Israeli forces destroyed 18 of the 24 Hamas battalions in Gaza, and four of the surviving units are concentrated in Rafah. He told Israeli legislators that he reiterated to Biden the necessity of crushing those units. \u201cI made it clear to the president in our conversation, in the clearest way, that we are determined to complete the elimination of these battalions in Rafah. There is no way to do it, except by going in on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nRussia Today news agency contributed to this report, published by ORDO News editors.\n\nContact us: [email protected]\n\nOur Standards, Terms of Use: Standard Terms And Conditions.\n\nTo eliminate any confusion arising from different time zones and daylight saving changes, all times displayed on our platforms are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).",

In this conversation, Trump reportedly warned Pence that certifying Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election could end Pence's political career, characterizing it as a \"career killer.\" The testimony of a White House valet, who was present during the call, illuminated Trump's efforts to pressure Pence amidst the turmoil of the Capitol attack and Trump's apparent indifference to the violence that occurred that day, including the shooting of Ashli Babbitt.\n\nThis transcript, coupled with Trump's public criticism of Pence for lacking the courage to overturn the election results, highlighted the strain in their relationship and the internal conflicts within the administration as the Capitol siege unfolded. Pence, in his memoir \"So Help Me God,\" acknowledged the pressure from Trump but focused on his constitutional duties during the chaos.\n\nIn another matter adding to the internal discord among Republicans, Trump's recent suggestion of a 15-week national abortion ban has sparked unease within the party. With the GOP facing challenges in forming a unified stance on reproductive rights, some Republican senators, including Tommy Tuberville and Chuck Grassley, have shown hesitancy in addressing Trump's abortion comments, reflecting the sensitivity of the issue within the party.\n\nThese events underline the ongoing controversies surrounding Trump and the internal dynamics of the Republican Party in the aftermath of the January 6 riot and amid evolving debates on key issues such as abortion rights.",

            "text": "Biden Campaign Distances Itself From Mysterious Big Dem Donor \u2018Chairman G\u2019\n\nAuthored by Soobin Kim and Bradley Hope via whalehunting.projectbrazen.com,\n\nLast fall, we reported on a man named Gaurav Srivastava who pretended to be a CIA operative to allegedly fleece the sanctioned Dutch oil trader Niels Troost. The ruse was simple, according to extensive recorded conversations: hand over half your company to me, a secret spy, and I\u2019ll protect you from the US government because \u2026 I\u2019m a secret spy.\n\nIn the following months since our original article, it emerged that Srivastava \u2013 or \u201cChairman G,\u201d as he likes to be called \u2013 is a big time political donor in the United States.\n\nWhale Hunting can exclusively reveal that FBI agents in Los Angeles have been interviewing Srivastava\u2019s current and former associates about his campaign donations, claims of being a federal officer and other financial affairs.\n\nWe also confirmed from a staff member for the Washington State Democratic Party that the Biden campaign is in the process of quietly refunding thousands of dollars of his political donations.\n\nThe FBI inquiries \u2014 ongoing for last several months \u2014 may lead nowhere, but the Biden campaign\u2019s decision to start refunding donations suggests there are deeper issues afoot for Srivastava.\n\n\u201cAll allegations raised in this story are false,\u201d a spokesman for Srivastava told us (full statement and more details on the news after the jump).\n\nSource: Sponsored content on LA Weekly\n\nThe culmination of Srivastava\u2019s rise to public life came alongside a more than $1 million donation in 2022 to the Atlantic Council, a DC-based think tank. The money underwrote a conference in Bali, where he was a \u201cco-host\u201d and rubbed shoulders with business magnates, political honchos and John Legend.\n\nBut that relationship isn\u2019t going smoothly. The Atlantic Council terminated its relationship with Srivastava, Politico reported last month, and returned additional funds donated by Srivastava in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision to terminate our relationship with Mr. Srivastava in May 2023 upon learning new information because of our donor review process. For example, we learned that The Gaurav & Sharon Srivastava Family Foundation was not an established 501C3 in April of 2023, despite Mr. Srivastava\u2019s representation to the Council that this was a registered foundation,\u201d the spokesperson told Politico.\n\nSrivastava\u2019s lawyer told Politico the Atlantic Council made the decision after they \u201cdisagreed\u201d about how a gift would be implemented. (Small note: Recipients of gifts usually try very hard to implement the handover of gifts.)\n\nAlongside his campaign to solve global food security he also became a big spender on political campaigns. Among Srivastava\u2019s key advisors for how to best disperse funds for political purposes were Greg Schultz (Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign manager) and Ret. General Wesley Clark. They didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission\u2019s database of individual contributions shows that Srivastava contributed at least $1 million to political campaigns and committees in the United States. As an Indian national he is eligible to donate to political campaigns as a Green Card holder. Lo and behold, the donations led to a photo op with Biden which you can find here.\n\nSince 2022, Srivastava has made sizeable donations \u2013 including over $500,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and $500,000 to Senate Majority PAC.\n\nOne mystery we are continuing to investigate: Whale Hunting discovered publicly available evidence suggesting Srivastava contributed over $116,000 using the personal details of an individual with the same name who resides in the same city. The funds were donated under the previous employer, occupation and mailing address of the namesake, who denies making the donations.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how those donations were made. Impersonating another individual to make a political contribution is strictly prohibited by law.\n\nThe single biggest recipient for the donations made with the namesake\u2019s personal details was the Biden Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 re-election, which received $50,000. About a dozen state Democratic parties across the U.S. also received funds through the Biden Victory Fund.\n\n\u201cThe Biden campaign is aware of the issue and the donation is in the process of being refunded,\u201d a staff member with Washington State Democratic Party, which received these funds, told Whale Hunting in an email.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear the exact allegations the FBI is investigating, but among the questions they\u2019ve presented current and former associates of Srivastava have been queries about his political spending, source of funds, involvement in international money transfers and other topics related to the allegations already aired publicly about Srivastava in a litany of lawsuits.\n\nSrivastava\u2019s spokesman\u2019s full comment here:\n\nAll allegations raised in this story are false. The source for this story and others, including 87 paid stories on obscure websites, is tied to a Russian asset facilitating the unfettered trade of Russian oil as made clear by the U.K. sanctions. There\u2019s a direct through-line between Russia, a barrel of oil and the high price of gas at the pump squeezing the American consumer. The slanderous suggestion of a fabricated relationship between Mr. Srivastava and a U.S. intelligence agency was orchestrated by the same Russian asset relied on as a source for your stories and designed by that Russian asset to put a target on his back, threatening the safety of him, his friends and family.\n\nSo if your year is off to a bad start, think about what Srivastava is now dealing with: being on the Feds\u2019 radar, juggling a glut of lawsuits brought on by all the people he\u2019s allegedly stiffed \u2013 from his former interior designer to former landlord to former business partners \u2013 and witnessing the collapse of his carefully crafted reputation.\n\nIn the meantime, Whale Hunting will be chasing this story to fill its gaping plot holes, one among them being where on earth Chairman G got the funds to make the donations in the first place. If you have any insight, please get in touch!",

However, addressing voters\u2019 concerns about the President\u2019s age is undoubtedly near the top of the list. The speech and Biden\u2019s ad campaign were designed to address that issue head-on.\n\nA recent Morning Consult poll shows that Biden\u2019s State of the Union made progress doing just that. According to the poll, the number of voters who say Biden is \u201ctoo old\u201d dropped by 3 points, but there was significant movement among Democrats (9 points) and Biden 2020 voters (8 points).\n\nThis is all good news. Biden\u2019s path to victory begins with winning back his 2020 voters. Trump\u2019s advantage in the polls is entirely because he is winning a higher percentage of his 2020 voters. In the New York Times/Siena poll, Trump has the support of 97% of voters who say they voted for him in 2020, while Biden only has 83% of his 2020 voters.\n\n.Navigator Research did a post-SOTU poll that found:\n\nSeven in ten Americans engaged with the State of the Union this year and a plurality viewed it positively; nearly three in five who watched at least part of the address were positive about the speech\u2026..\n\nMore\u2026.\n\nNote\u2026\n\nThe Right leaning Real Clear Politics also has Biden at 40.3% approval\u2026.",

McAfee said in a brief \"Certificate of Immediate Review\" that he intends to \"continue addressing the many other unrelated pending pretrial motions,\" regardless of whether the appellate court agrees to take up the case.\n\nMcAfee last week rejected a bid by Trump and his co-defendants to disqualify Willis and her office from prosecuting the case because of a romantic relationship she had with Wade, whom she hired as special prosecutor in November 2021. The judge said Willis and her office could stay on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he did hours after McAfee issued his ruling.\n\nMcAfee said in his order Wednesday that the \"state has informed the court that it has complied with the order's demands.\"\n\nSteven Sadow, Trump's lawyer, said in a statement that the defense team is \"optimistic that appellate review will lead to the case being dismissed and the DA being disqualified.\"\n\nThe bombshell revelation that Willis and Wade were romantically involved was first raised by Michael Roman, a longtime GOP operative charged alongside Trump, in a court filing in January. He claimed the two began dating before Wade was hired to work on the investigation into Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia, and alleged that Willis financially benefited from the relationship. Trump and seven others joined Roman's effort to remove Willis and her office from the case and have the charges against them dismissed.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis testifies during a hearing on the Georgia election interference case, Thursday, Feb. 15, 2024, in Atlanta. Alyssa Pointer / AP\n\nWade and Willis admitted they were romantically involved, but denied any wrongdoing. Willis said their relationship ended last summer.\n\nWhile McAfee allowed Willis to remain on the case so long as Wade withdrew, he offered a scathing rebuke of the pair. The judge chided the district attorney for what he said was a \"tremendous lapse in judgment\" and criticized the \"unprofessional manner\" of her testimony during an evidentiary hearing last month, during which Wade and Willis separately answered questions from prosecutors and defense attorneys about their relationship.\n\nMcAfee said that while he was not able to \"conclusively establish\" when Wade and Willis' relationship turned romantic, \"an odor of mendacity remains.\"\n\n\"Reasonable questions about whether the District Attorney and her hand-selected lead [special assistant district attorney] testified untruthfully about the timing of their relationship further underpin the finding of an appearance of impropriety and the need to make proportional efforts to cure it,\" McAfee wrote.\n\nWade offered his resignation to Willis on Friday afternoon, writing in a letter to her that he was stepping down from his role as special prosecutor \"in the interest of democracy, in dedication to the American public, and to move this case forward as quickly as possible.\"\n\nWillis accepted his resignation and praised Wade in her own letter for his \"patriotism, courage and dedication to justice\" in the face of threats against himself and his family, \"as well as unjustified attacks in the media and in court on your reputation as a lawyer.\"\n\nTrump faces 10 counts in the sprawling racketeering case brought by the Fulton County district attorney, who claims the former president and his allies engaged in a scheme to reverse the outcome of the last presidential election in Georgia. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Eighteen others were charged alongside Trump, though four accepted plea deals from prosecutors. All of the remaining 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nJared Eggleston contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Every March, in celebration of National Women\u2019s History Month, the Department of State issues its \u201cWomen of Courage\u201d award. This award is given to women around the world who have advanced the cause of peace, justice, and human rights\u2014often at great personal cost. This year, one name was glaringly absent from the list: Venezuela\u2019s Maria Corina Machado. Machado is not only leading the charge against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s dictatorship in Venezuela but also facing down the Biden administration\u2019s push to yet again appease the dictatorship at the expense of our democratic allies.\n\nDespite heavy-handed repression and the regime\u2019s control over electoral institutions, the Venezuelan opposition organized a decisive primary election in October 2023. Machado received an overwhelming mandate with 93 percent of the vote. Poll after poll in Venezuela shows widespread dissatisfaction with Maduro\u2014upwards of 80 percent. Such figures indicate that even the most egregious attempts to steal the election likely won\u2019t turn the tide.\n\nMaduro knows he does not stand a chance against her and is rightfully afraid of an open and competitive process. Despite her overwhelming victory in the primaries\u2014or likely because of it\u2014the regime-controlled Venezuelan Supreme Court has upheld an unconstitutional ban on Machado\u2019s ability to hold office. The regime has also imprisoned her allies and staff. However, the state is not targeting her alone. In the last few months, we\u2019ve seen extraordinary escalations in Venezuela, including the arrest and detention of human rights activist Rocio San Miguel, the legislative attempt to criminalize civil society, the murder of a Venezuelan dissident by Maduro-led gangs in Chile, the threat of a military invasion of Guyana, and the expulsion of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and her team. Over the years, the commissioner has diligently documented the extent of torture, arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings, and other human rights abuses that have forced over 7.7 million Venezuelans out of their country\u2014over 240,000 of whom illegally entered the United States last year alone.\n\nYet instead of holding the regime accountable for these actions, the White House has bizarrely relieved sanctions, providing the regime with additional resources for their human rights violations. They\u2019ve politely asked for the regime to \u201cdefine a process\u201d to reinstate Machado and other ineligible candidates but have exerted minimal pressure as Venezuela slides further and further into totalitarianism. With the regime announcing a 2024 Presidential election on July 28, there are whispers that the White House will lean on Machado to step down from her candidacy in favor of an opposition leader more palatable to Maduro and his cronies. This translates to a candidate that the regime can defeat.\n\nLet\u2019s call this what it is: Yankee imperialism. It\u2019s a term the left loves to throw around but rarely admits its practices. What other phrase describes a global power telling a small, persecuted opposition movement that their attempts at democracy are cute but that Washington would prefer to call the shots there? Even worse than that, it is imperialism in favor of dictatorship\u2014a capitulation to Maduro, a man whose greatest success prior to stealing the presidency of Venezuela was driving a bus\u2014and letting him decide who he runs against. Those are not the actions of a country that won two world wars against global tyranny. We would never allow a candidate to determine his presidential opponent in the United States\u2014we should not accept it in Venezuela, either.\n\nAt one point, the United States once stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Venezuelan opposition. Sadly, they now stand alone in their fight for freedom thanks to the Biden administration\u2019s failed policy of appeasement. Despite being abandoned, however, they remain undeterred. Venezuelans mobilized a primary candidate that garnered over 2.4 million votes. They organize daily both within the country and outside, drawing much-needed international attention to their suffering. In the opposition, we see an echo of the Venezuela that was once the most educated and wealthiest nation in South America. In them, we see an echo of the Venezuela that was a model for democracy in the region. But more importantly, in them\u2014and Maria Corina Machado\u2014we do not just see an echo of the past. We see a symbol of the future.\n\nThe Biden administration claims it rewards women with courage. Why, then, do we see them trying to penalize one in Maria Corina Machado?\n\nCarrie Filipetti is the Executive Director of The Vandenberg Coalition and the former Deputy Assistant Secretary and Deputy Special Representative for Venezuela in the Trump administration.\n\nImage: Shutterstock.com.",

As Trump in February handily won primary contests in Nevada and New Hampshire, the prospects of any Republican challenger overtaking him in the presidential race dimmed significantly.\n\n''Americans know that they were better off with President Trump four years ago than with Crooked Joe Biden and his disastrous policies. We need a return to America First policies that successfully kept our country safe and supercharged the economy for all Americans,\" Trump's campaign Communications Director Steven Cheung said in a statement.\n\nUnimpressed, Biden campaign Communications Director Michael Tyler said in a statement, ''If Donald Trump put up these kinds of numbers on The Apprentice, he'd fire himself,.\"\n\n''But here's why he ain't got it: his extreme, toxic agenda of banning abortion, slashing Social Security, and promoting political violence is repelling donors and doing exactly (asterisk)nothing(asterisk) to earn support from the voters who will decide this election.''\n\nBiden's campaign, meanwhile, said his political operation raised $53 million last month and ended February with $155 million on hand. That includes Biden's joint fundraising with the Democratic National Committee. The full picture will not be available until April when some of the committees in his political operation are due to file reports.\n\nHis main campaign account raised $21 million in February, according to its latest filing with the FEC, and ended the month with $71 million on hand.\n\nThe monthly numbers reported by the two Trump committees are key to his fundraising operation but only a portion of the full picture, with other committees scheduled to report their latest numbers in April. The Save America committee has been paying the bulk of Trump's legal fees in his various court cases. Legal spending made up 85% of its total operating expenses during the first two months of this year, roughly the same as 2023, when such expenses were about 89%. It has spent $8.5 million on legal fees so far this year.\n\nTrump's February numbers did not include any fundraising with the Republican National Committee. Earlier this month, days after his last major opponent Nikki Haley dropped out of the GOP primary, Trump's political team took over the cash-strapped RNC and installed a new leadership team.\n\nThe campaign this week set up joint fundraising operations with the RNC.\n\n___\n\nKessler reported from Washington.",

            "text": "Washington D.C.\u2019s hottest club is at the Capitol Building, where some of the most important people in the nation are mingling, and will be followed by an hour-long talk by the most important man in the United States, Joe Biden. Biden, in his 2024 State of The Union Address, gave a speech that surpassed the expectations of many. The president, now 81 (going on 82 this November), gave a speech that was full of life. However, any error in speech or minor-slip by Biden was more than welcome for the Republican Party, who are seeking to defeat Biden in this November election. This State of the Union was not only about the present but sparked conversations about the potential next four years in Biden\u2019s America.\n\nAs the speech began, President Biden detailed the importance of this moment in American history. He described unprecedented conflicts, like the war in Ukraine and the notion that not \u201csince President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault [in the United States] as they are today.\u201d The speech continued, further touting the progress America has made in international relations. Such as Sweden joining NATO earlier in March. However, the internal conflicts within America took the forefront. Biden began refuting elements of Trump\u2019s history, calling the January 6 insurrection the gravest threat to American democracy since the Civil War.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s comeback is building a future of American possibilities\u2026 investing in all of America, in all Americans to make \u2026 sure everyone has a fair shot, and we leave no one \u2014 no one behind,\u201d Biden said. The President further echoed his desire for a great American rise in prosperity. His focus was primarily on populist points, such as lowering the cost of prescription drugs for many Americans in the aspirations of tackling corporate greed. A similar plan to Biden\u2019s aspirations is to cut taxes for the middle class, at the expense of high-earning people and companies who, according to Biden, will begin to pay their fair share of taxes in his administration. Moreover, the overall positive framing of the American comeback in the alleged post-COVID era, some of Bidens claims about these tax cuts and tax enforcement for high earners could be deemed misleading. Due to the nature of the American tax system, only 14 of the 55 biggest earning companies will be applicable to this aim by the administration. This can be attributed to the \u201cbook-income\u201d nature of the policy.\n\nHowever, the biggest pivot from typical Democratic party talking points was the result of a brief encounter the President had with representative Marjorie Taylor Greene. Moments before the State of the Union began Greene was seen handing Biden a pin. Later in the night, as the speech progressed, the topic of the US-Mexico border came up and Biden made his biggest error of the night. Greene called out to Biden in the middle of his talk, asking \u201cwhat about Laken Riley?\u201d Riley was a 22-year-old student at Augusta University who was tragically killed this past February, with the accused suspect being an illegal immigrant from Venezuela. As Greene beckoned Biden to recognize Riley, Biden held up a pin that read \u2018Say Her Name, Laken Riley\u2019 and said: \u201cLanken \u2014 Lanken Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed.\u201d Greene quickly retorted, \u201cby an illegal!\u201d Biden responded, \u201cby an illegal. That\u2019s right. But how many thousands of people are being killed by legals?\u201d The term \u201cillegal\u201d has been out of the Democratic vocabulary for a while now. Biden described the accused as \u201cillegal\u201d despite his continued claim that he \u201cwill not demonize immigrants by saying they are \u2018poison in the blood of our country,\u2019\u201d the latter half of the statement derived from former president Trump.\n\nAlthough the State of The Union speeches are typically symbolic, this speech indicates the potential for Biden to take back the reins within the polls and to show the public that although he is old, he is not too old to hang onto old beliefs and reactionary framing.",

Die Zweifel werden immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer.\n\nAmtsenthebungsverfahren gegen Joe Biden: Republikaner haben Probleme mit Beweisen\n\nDer Vorsitzende des House Oversight Committee, James Comer, hatte die Ermittlungen gegen Biden im vergangenen Jahr mit Anschuldigungen wegen schwerer Verbrechen und Vergehen eingeleitet, die die Republikaner seither nur mit M\u00fche unterst\u00fctzen konnten. F\u00fcnfzehn Monate sp\u00e4ter haben die Republikaner im Kongress keine Beweise oder Zeugenaussagen erhalten, die belegen, dass Joe Biden direkt an den Gesch\u00e4ften seines Sohnes Hunter Biden beteiligt war oder davon profitierte.\n\nUnd obwohl einige von Hunter Bidens engen Mitarbeitern seinen Vater in die N\u00e4he der an einigen Gesch\u00e4ften Beteiligten ger\u00fcckt haben \u2013 was die Behauptungen des Pr\u00e4sidenten, er habe nichts von Hunters Aktivit\u00e4ten gewusst, untergr\u00e4bt \u2013, entsprach keine der Anschuldigungen den Vorw\u00fcrfen der Republikaner, Hunter Bidens gesch\u00e4ftliche Aktivit\u00e4ten h\u00e4tten eine Einflussnahme erm\u00f6glicht, die Joe Biden und seine Familie bereichert habe.\n\nMit ihrer knappen Mehrheit ben\u00f6tigen die Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus nahezu Einstimmigkeit, um ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren gegen den Pr\u00e4sidenten zu verabschieden, was sie nicht haben. Stattdessen ist die Skepsis unter den Republikanern nur noch gewachsen, seit ein FBI-Informant angeklagt wurde, \u00fcber die Bidens gelogen zu haben, wodurch das, was als wichtiges Beweisst\u00fcck pr\u00e4sentiert worden war, ins Wanken geriet.\n\nThe Washington Post vier Wochen gratis lesen Ihr Qualit\u00e4ts-Ticket der washingtonpost.com: Holen Sie sich exklusive Recherchen und 200+ Geschichten vier Wochen gratis.\n\nDie Zweifel wachsen: Joe Biden muss die Amtsenthebung wohl nicht f\u00fcrchten\n\nIn Ermangelung dieser Stimmen haben sich Comer und andere Mitglieder der Untersuchungsaussch\u00fcsse auf die M\u00f6glichkeit einer Strafanzeige verlegt. Comer hat gedroht, \u201emehrere\u201c Strafanzeigen zu stellen, aber es bleibt unklar, ob die Gesetzgeber Pr\u00e4sident Biden formell eines Verbrechens beschuldigen werden und welche Verbrechen sie ihm vorwerfen.\n\n\u201eIch bin mir nicht sicher, wie wir den Pr\u00e4sidenten strafrechtlich belangen k\u00f6nnen, ohne ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren anzustrengen\u201c, sagte Abgeordneter Kelly Armstrong. \u201eIch meine, das [Justizministerium] wird das sowieso nie in Angriff nehmen.\u201c\n\nArmstrong, Mitglied des Justizausschusses des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses, f\u00fcgte hinzu, dass der Ausschuss gegen mehrere Zeugen, die vor dem Ausschuss ausgesagt haben, Strafverfahren wegen Verst\u00f6\u00dfen gegen den Foreign Agents Registration Act einleiten k\u00f6nnte. Hunter Biden, der es ablehnte, am Mittwoch zu erscheinen, sieht sich neun strafrechtlichen Anklagen in einem seit langem andauernden Bundessteuerfall und Anklagen wegen Waffenbesitzes gegen\u00fcber.\n\n\u201eMeine Meinung zu einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren im Allgemeinen? Es ist eine sehr hohe Messlatte, die sie erf\u00fcllen m\u00fcssen, und sie m\u00fcssen ihre Kollegen davon \u00fcberzeugen, dass es das Richtige ist\u201c, sagte der Abgeordnete Brian Fitzpatrick. \u201eWenn sie es ablehnen, ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren einzuleiten, ist das meiner Meinung nach die richtige Entscheidung.\u201c\n\nViele Anschuldigungen der Republikaner gegen Biden verpuffen\n\nDem offensichtlichen Zusammenbruch einer der wichtigsten Ermittlungen der Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus ging eine Reihe von Vorf\u00e4llen voraus, bei denen Comer, der sogar von einigen republikanischen Kollegen f\u00fcr seine Fox-News-zentrierte Herangehensweise an die Ermittlungen kritisiert wurde, Anschuldigungen gegen Biden und seinen Sohn erhob, bevor sie \u00f6ffentlich verpufften. Abgeordneter Jamie Raskin, der rangh\u00f6chste Demokrat im Oversight Committee, nannte die Anh\u00f6rung in seiner Er\u00f6ffnungsrede am Mittwoch \u201edas Ende des vielleicht spektakul\u00e4rsten Scheiterns in der Geschichte der Untersuchungen des Kongresses\u201c.\n\nTony Bobulinski, ein ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner von Hunter Biden, sagt am Mittwoch vor dem House Oversight Committee aus. \u00a9 Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post\n\n\u201eUnsere Kollegen bereiten sich jetzt offenbar darauf vor, ihr Gesicht zu wahren, indem sie die Amtsenthebungsfarce mit Strafantr\u00e4gen beenden\u201c, sagte Raskin. \u201eAber strafrechtliche Verweise erfordern Beweise f\u00fcr Verbrechen. Und die einzigen Verbrechen, die wir gesehen haben, sind die der eigenen Kronzeugen der Grand Old Party.\u201c\n\nJede Strafanzeige, die der Kongress an das Justizministerium richtet, w\u00e4re ein symbolischer Akt, der f\u00fcr sich genommen kein rechtliches Gewicht hat und den Staatsanw\u00e4lten die Entscheidung \u00fcberl\u00e4sst, ob sie Anklage erheben. Aber eine strafrechtliche Verweisung k\u00f6nnte die Feststellungen des Oversight Committee so deutlich wie m\u00f6glich zum Ausdruck bringen und den Republikanern, die versucht haben, unbegr\u00fcndete Behauptungen und Theorien \u00fcber Biden und seine Familie zu legitimieren, als Kommunikationsmittel dienen.\n\nEinige Mitglieder deuteten an, dass sie bereit seien, alle neuen Beweise, die die Ermittler des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses in der Zwischenzeit ans Tageslicht bringen k\u00f6nnten, zu pr\u00fcfen. Der Abgeordnete Mike Garcia merkte jedoch an, dass den Republikanern vor dem R\u00fcckkampf zwischen Biden und dem ehemaligen Pr\u00e4sidenten Donald Trump die Zeit davonlaufe - und dass Biden vor gr\u00f6\u00dferen Herausforderungen bei den Wahlen stehe als vor einem m\u00f6glichen Amtsenthebungsverfahren, das in einem von den Demokraten kontrollierten Senat scheitern d\u00fcrfte.\n\nDie Wahl gegen Donald Trump ist f\u00fcr Biden das viel gr\u00f6\u00dfere Problem\n\n\u201eLetztendlich wird das amerikanische Volk im Oktober oder November dar\u00fcber abstimmen, ob dieser Pr\u00e4sident f\u00fcr das Amt geeignet ist oder nicht\u201c, sagte Garcia. \u201eIch denke, er hat schon genug andere Herausforderungen und Misserfolge hinter sich, so dass ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren wahrscheinlich nicht einmal das Wahlergebnis beeinflussen w\u00fcrde\u201c.\n\nTony Bobulinski, ein ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner von Hunter Biden, und Jason Galanis, der wegen mehrfachen Betrugs eine fast 16-j\u00e4hrige Haftstrafe in Montgomery, Alabama, verb\u00fc\u00dft, sagten beide bei der Anh\u00f6rung am Mittwoch auf Gehei\u00df der Republikaner aus. Sie behaupteten beide, dass Joe Biden in die gesch\u00e4ftlichen Aktivit\u00e4ten seiner Familienmitglieder verwickelt war, bevor sie Details \u00fcber begrenzte Interaktionen mit Joe Biden angaben, um die Behauptungen zu untermauern.\n\nBobulinski verwies auf ein Treffen mit Joe Biden im Mai 2017, das von Hunter Biden und dem Bruder des Pr\u00e4sidenten, James, arrangiert worden war, als Beweis daf\u00fcr, dass Joe Biden von den Gesch\u00e4ften seines Sohnes mit ausl\u00e4ndischen Unternehmen wusste. Doch als Bobulinski am Mittwoch zu dem Treffen befragt wurde, erw\u00e4hnte er bei der Beschreibung des 45-min\u00fctigen Treffens in Los Angeles nicht ausdr\u00fccklich das Streben nach einem Gesch\u00e4ft mit CEFC, einem chinesischen Energiekonglomerat.\n\n\u201eWir sprachen \u00fcber meinen Hintergrund, den milit\u00e4rischen Hintergrund meiner Familie, die verschiedenen gesch\u00e4ftlichen Unternehmungen, die ich auf der ganzen Welt unternommen hatte, die Familie, mit der ich zusammenarbeitete - Joe verbrachte Zeit damit, \u00fcber seine Familie zu sprechen, \u00fcber einige der Trag\u00f6dien, die sie durchlebt hatten\u201c, beschrieb Bobulinski das Gespr\u00e4ch mit Joe Biden, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht im Amt war.\n\nRepublikaner pr\u00e4sentieren zweifelhafte Zeugen im Amtsenthebungsverfahren\n\nGalanis, der per Zoom vom Gef\u00e4ngnis aus aussagte, beschrieb auch eine \u201erelativ kurze Diskussion\u201c mit dem damaligen Vizepr\u00e4sidenten Biden im Mai 2014, nachdem Hunter Biden auf einer Party Galanis und eine kleine Gruppe von Personen - darunter die russische Milliard\u00e4rin Jelena Baturina und ihr Ehemann Juri Luschkow sowie Hunter Bidens ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner Devon Archer \u2013 beiseite genommen und Joe Biden \u00fcber den Lautsprecher angerufen hatte. Galanis behauptete, dass es in dem Gespr\u00e4ch um den bevorstehenden Besuch von Baturina und Luschkow in Washington ging und \u201esie dar\u00fcber sprachen, gut zu seinem Jungen zu sein\u201c. Auf die Frage, ob es bei diesem Anruf darum ging, dass Hunter Biden potenziellen Investoren \u201eZugang zur Marke Biden\u201c verschaffte, antwortete Galanis, dass dies der Fall sei.\n\nDer Abgeordnete Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) nannte w\u00e4hrend der Anh\u00f6rung Unstimmigkeiten zwischen den Aussagen von Mitgliedern der Familie Biden und den Aussagen von Bobulinski und Galanis als m\u00f6gliche Grundlage f\u00fcr eine weitere strafrechtliche Verweisung: L\u00fcgen gegen\u00fcber dem Kongress. Nach der Anh\u00f6rung verteidigte Palmer den Prozess des Oversight Committee und warnte, dass die Mitglieder noch Zeit h\u00e4tten, ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren in Betracht zu ziehen.\n\n\u201eIch denke, wir m\u00fcssen sehr \u00fcberlegt und sorgf\u00e4ltig vorgehen, denn es geht um das Leben vieler Menschen. Mein Ziel ist es nicht, jemanden zu erwischen, mein Ziel ist es, die Wahrheit herauszufinden\u201c, sagte Palmer.\n\nDie Anh\u00f6rung wurde zeitweise sehr kontrovers gef\u00fchrt. Als die Abgeordnete Lisa C. McClain versuchte, den Ruf von Hunter Biden zu schm\u00e4lern, indem sie ihn sp\u00f6ttisch als \u201egoldenes Kind\u201c bezeichnete, lachte die Abgeordnete Ayanna Pressley und murmelt, dass McClains Kommentar \u201ereich\u201c sei. \u201eSchauen Sie sich Ihre Partei an\u201c, f\u00fcgte Pressley hinzu. \u201eG\u00f6nnen Sie mir eine Pause.\u201c\n\nAn einem Punkt forderte der Abgeordnete Jared Moskowitz Comer auf, einen Antrag auf ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren gegen Biden zu stellen. \u201eWann k\u00f6nnen wir dem amerikanischen Volk sagen, dass Sie aufh\u00f6ren werden, Ihr Geld zu verschwenden und einfach die Abstimmung \u00fcber ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren beantragen?\u201c, sagte Moskowitz.\n\n\u201eWir machen keine Schnellabstimmungen wie ihr\u201c, entgegnete der Vorsitzende des Justizausschusses Jim Jordan.\n\nDemokraten bezichtigen die Republikaner der L\u00fcge\n\nMehrere Demokraten warfen den Republikanern vor, eine Anh\u00f6rung zu einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren abzuhalten, das zum Teil auf der Grundlage einer Behauptung eingeleitet wurde, von der die Beh\u00f6rden inzwischen sagen, sie sei unwahr. Der Sonderstaatsanwalt David Weiss, der zuvor Strafanzeige gegen Hunter Biden erstattet hatte, k\u00fcndigte im vergangenen Monat eine Anklage gegen einen FBI-Informanten an, dessen Behauptungen Comer als grundlegendes Beweisst\u00fcck in der Amtsenthebungsuntersuchung angepriesen hatte, weil er angeblich das FBI angelogen hatte.\n\nComer und Senator Chuck Grassley hatten im vergangenen Fr\u00fchjahr unbegr\u00fcndete Behauptungen von Alexander Smirnow - einer ehemaligen vertraulichen Quelle des FBI - aus dem Jahr 2020 aufgedeckt, wonach Biden in ein Bestechungsprogramm verwickelt gewesen sei, und das FBI aufgefordert, das Dokument mit Smirnows Behauptungen vorzulegen. Die von Smirnov erhobenen Behauptungen wurden zuvor vom FBI unter dem damaligen Generalstaatsanwalt William P. Barr gepr\u00fcft und f\u00fcr nicht stichhaltig befunden und anschlie\u00dfend fallen gelassen.\n\nComer und andere Republikaner im Kongress argumentierten jedoch monatelang, dass Smirnovs Behauptungen ein Beweis daf\u00fcr seien, dass die Bidens in korrupte Gesch\u00e4fte verwickelt gewesen seien, und dass das FBI diesen Behauptungen nicht nachgegangen sei. Die Saga fand in den Medien gro\u00dfen Widerhall; Sean Hannitys Show auf Fox News strahlte mindestens 85 Beitr\u00e4ge \u00fcber die unbegr\u00fcndete Behauptung aus, Biden habe eine Bestechung angenommen, so eine Aufstellung von Media Matters for America.\n\n\u201eDiese gesamte Untersuchung basiert auf einer bahnbrechenden Information, die sich in einem geheimen SCIF-Raum befand, und in diesem Raum befand sich ein Dokument, das Pr\u00e4sident Biden direkt eines 10-Millionen-Dollar-Bestechungsschemas bezichtigte\u201c, sagte Abgeordnete Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201eWas ist vor einem Monat passiert? Das FBI verhaftete die Person, die diese Anschuldigungen vorbrachte, weil sie ihre Aussage gegen\u00fcber dem FBI gef\u00e4lscht hatte. Das gesamte Amtsenthebungsverfahren basiert auf einer tats\u00e4chlich nachweisbaren Person, die gelogen hat.\u201c\n\nWas haben russische Agenten mit dem Verfahren gegen Biden zu tun?\n\nDie Demokraten befragten auch Lev Parnas, einen ehemaligen Mitarbeiter von Rudy Giuliani, der in einem Fall von Wahlkampf-Finanzbetrug verurteilt wurde und am Mittwoch erschien, \u00fcber seine Zeit der Zusammenarbeit mit Giuliani in den Jahren 2018 und 2019, um sch\u00e4dliche Informationen \u00fcber Joe Biden aufzusp\u00fcren. Der ukrainisch-amerikanische Gesch\u00e4ftsmann rief die Kohorte von Pro-Trump-Gesetzgebern auf den Plan, die Fehlinformationen \u00fcber die Bidens und ihre Arbeit in der Ukraine verbreiteten.\n\n\u201eDie einzigen Informationen, die jemals \u00fcber die Bidens und die Ukraine verbreitet wurden, stammen aus einer Quelle und nur aus einer Quelle: Russland und russischen Agenten\u201c, sagte Parnas aus.\n\nAm Ende der Anh\u00f6rung sagte Comer, er lade den Pr\u00e4sidenten ein, vor dem Kongress auszusagen, eine Einladung, die ein Sprecher des Wei\u00dfen Hauses in den sozialen Medien mit einem Lachen quittierte.\n\nZur Autorin Jacqueline Alemany ist Reporterin f\u00fcr Kongressuntersuchungen bei The Washington Post.

            "text": "Given the inability thus far of Democrats and the Washington D.C. establishment to metaphorically \"kill\" former President Donald Trump politically, there are growing concerns among some of Trump's supporters that his enemies might resort to an actual assassination attempt to prevent him from returning to the White House.\n\nRhetorical fuel was just poured on that smoldering fire by outspoken Democratic strategist James Carville, who admittedly used a phrase synonymous with assassinations to describe what President Joe Biden's campaign needed to do to secure victory over Trump, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nCarville has long been known to use overly hyperbolic and controversial commentary in his partisan rhetoric, but his remarks that could be construed by some as a call for the murder of the former president likely went too far and deserve condemnation from his fellow Democrats.\n\nCarville uses assassination euphemism against Trump\n\nOn Wednesday, according to Breitbart, Carville appeared on CNN with host Anderson Cooper and suggested that President Biden's \"surrogates\" engage in \"wet work\" -- which he himself admitted meant \"to take a guy out\" -- on his behalf against former President Trump.\n\nCooper played a clip of Biden criticizing specific prior controversial comments from Trump and reminded Carville that he'd previously suggested that Biden and his campaign needed to be doing exactly that \"more and more.\"\n\n\"Not so much him,\" Carville said of Biden. \"I mean, to be candid Anderson, President Biden is not the best attack politician I've ever seen in my life, and we'll leave it at that. But there are a lot of people to do what I call, quote, the wet work, unquote.\"\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, \"wet work\" is a well-known euphemism for \"work involving murder or assassination,\" and Breitbart noted that it references \"spilling blood\" while taking a life.\n\nCarville admits \"CIA term\" means \"to take a guy out\"\n\nRather than castigate Carville for his violent \"wet work\" rhetoric, CNN's Cooper let out a slight chuckle in response and smiled as he joked, \"It sounds like a mob hit.\" Carville replied with a smirk, \"Well, it kinda is but it's paid TV and stuff like that. But yes, it's a CIA term -- to take a guy out.\"\n\nReturning his attention to Biden and his re-election campaign, the longtime Democratic operative said, \"But he doesn't need to do the wet work. People like me and other groups in the party need to do that. He's not very good at it. I don't think people want to hear\" that from him.\n\n\"And he can -- he can cruise along at a better altitude, but this has got to be done and they've got to press this advantage right now while they have it,\" Carville added.\n\nTucker Carlson believes Trump's opponents will try to assassinate him\n\nThere are a few voices on the right, none more prominent than former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who have suggested that Democrats and the political establishment, having failed at all other prior attempts to politically and financially destroy, may actually resort to physical violence and assassination to ensure that former President Trump can't serve a second term in the White House.\n\nBusiness Insider reported in September 2023 that Carlson, during an interview with comedian Adam Carolla, warned, \"If you begin with criticism, then you go to protest, then you go to impeachment, now you go to indictment, and none of them work. What's next? Graph it out, man. We're speeding toward assassination, obviously.\"\n\nHe added, \"They have decided -- permanent Washington, both parties have decided -- that there's something about Trump that's so threatening to them, they just can't have him.\"\n\nThe outlet noted that just one week earlier Carlson had directly asked Trump if he was worried about assassination attempts against him, and though Trump seemed to sidestep a direct response to that question, he did point out that his partisan opponents were \"savage animals. They're people that are sick.\"",

But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time, and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the crisis.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, \u2018Are you better off today than you were yesterday?\u2019 Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and his allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign racked up $1.4 million in debt to a private security firm, while the Biden administration has repeatedly denied his requests for Secret Service protection.\n\nAccording to their latest filing with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday, Kennedy's campaign raised $3.1 million in February but spent $2.8 million that same month. That is not including the $1.4 million the Kennedy campaign also owes to Gavin De Becker and Associates, the private security firm owned by De Becker, a security specialist and longtime friend of Kennedy, according to Politico.\n\nNot including withstanding debt, the campaign paid just over $200,000 last month for security services and related travel expenses, raising the total paid to Gavin de Becker & Associates to more than $2 million.\n\nMeanwhile, De Becker has donated millions in what he deemed both contributions and \"bridge funding\" to the pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024. According to a separate FEC filing by the political action committee on Wednesday, De Becker donated another $4 million last month. That accounts for nearly all the total $4.1 million American Values 2024 reported garnering in February.\n\nCRUZ DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM MAYORKAS ON DENIAL OF SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION FOR RFK JR\n\nDe Becker has become the largest donor to the super PAC, second to Republican mega-donor Tim Mellon, Politico reported.\n\nDespite having raised nearly $28 million since kicking off his presidential campaign in April 2023, Kennedy has spent heavily. At the end of February, the campaign reported $5 million in cash on hand. Biden's campaign reported $71 million in cash on hand at the end of February, and former President Trump's campaign reported $33.5 million in cash on hand, Wednesday's FEC filings show.\n\nKennedy has assailed Biden for having rejected at least three requests for U.S. Secret Service protection while on the 2024 campaign trail. His father, former U.S. senator, U.S. Attorney General and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968, and his uncle, former President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963,\n\nRFK JR TRESPASSER INCLUDED IN SECRET SERVICE RISK ASSESSMENT MONTHS BEFORE DHS DENIED PROTECTION: SOURCE\n\nAs recently as December, Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas deemed that Secret Service protection for Kennedy \"is not warranted at this time,\" according to a letter obtained by Deseret News. According to Kennedy, that was despite several documented death threats against him.\n\nIn late October, a man was arrested twice for trespassing at Kennedy's home twice in the same day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe suspect, Jonathan Macht, was listed in a Secret Service risk assessment as part of the candidate's first request for protection in June, sources told Fox News Digital at the time. The assessment deemed Kennedy was at elevated risk, but the Democrat turned independent presidential candidate's request for protection was still denied by Homeland Security.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.",

File Photo by John Angelillo/UPI | License Photo\n\nMarch 19 (UPI) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump called on the Supreme Court on Tuesday to rule that he has \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from charges stemming from his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 general election. \u201cThe president cannot function, and the presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the president faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office,\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team argued in its filing.\n\nThe former president and New York real estate mogul was indicted in August on four charges alleging he participated in a scheme aimed at keeping him in the White House despite losing the 2020 general election to then-Democratic candidate and current President Joe Biden.\n\nHis attorneys have repeatedly argued Trump is shielded from prosecution for actions that occurred during his presidency \u2014 a stance that a three-judge appeals panel early last month soundly rejected.\n\nThe conservative-leaning Supreme Court has agreed to consider the case and has set an expedited start date of April 25 for the argument.\n\nIn the filing on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s legal team warned the justices that a denial of criminal immunity would \u201cincapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion\u201d while condemning them \u201cto years of post-officer trauma at the hands of political opponents.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial presidential decisions,\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team argued, \u201ctaking away the strength, authority and decisiveness of the presidency.\u201d\n\nThe former president\u2019s lawyers cite as precedence a Supreme Court decision involving former President Richard Nixon that found presidents enjoyed absolute immunity for civil damages that arise from acts within the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of their official duties.\n\nThey continue that if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t dismiss the charges and that some sort of immunity does exist, it should remand the case to lower courts to consider, which would further delay the start of the case.\n\nTrump\u2019s trial was set to begin on March 4.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team has repeatedly sought to delay his trials, in an action that could see decisions coming down after November\u2019s presidential election. Trump is the presumed Republican candidate, and if re-elected president, he could direct the Justice Department to dissolve all federal cases against him.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, who filed the four-count indictment in August, has repeatedly argued against both the strategy to delay the start of Trump\u2019s trial and his stance on absolute immunity.\n\nIn a filing from early last month, Smith said the charges filed against the former president \u201cstrike at the heart of our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cA president\u2019s alleged criminal scheme to overturn an election and thwart the peaceful transfer of power to his successor should be the last place to recognize a novel form of absolute immunity from federal criminal law,\u201d Smith wrote.",

Daines\u2019 comments come at a time of heightened concern over national security and the need for stronger measures to protect the border. The incident serves as a reminder of the complex challenges facing immigration policy and the importance of addressing security threats in a timely and effective manner.\n\nSteve Daines calls out Biden after Terror suspect apprehended at the Border: \u201c\u2026This is Chilling\u2026\u201d pic.twitter.com/tIb2Qojzxv \u2014 \uaabb\uaadd\u00ea\u0309 \uaabb\uaadd\u00ea\u0309 (@TheThe1776) March 21, 2024 RELATED STORIES\n\nRelated Story.\n\nIn a recent tweet, Senator Steve Daines expressed his concern after a terror suspect was apprehended at the border, calling the situation \u201cchilling.\u201d This incident has once again brought attention to the ongoing challenges and security threats at the border, sparking a heated debate on immigration policies and border security measures.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nThe apprehension of a terror suspect at the border is a stark reminder of the complex issues that the United States faces in terms of national security and border control. Senator Daines\u2019s strong reaction to this event reflects the gravity of the situation and the need for immediate action to address these pressing concerns.\n\nThe incident also raises questions about the effectiveness of current border security measures and the need for stricter protocols to prevent individuals with malicious intentions from entering the country. As Senator Daines pointed out, the apprehension of a terror suspect at the border should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers to prioritize national security and take proactive steps to protect the country from external threats.\n\nThe situation at the border is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of illegal immigration, human trafficking, and national security threats.

In a time of heightened political polarization, it is crucial for lawmakers to set aside their differences and work together to find common ground on crucial matters of national security and public safety.\n\nThe apprehension of a terror suspect at the border also highlights the need for increased vigilance and surveillance to prevent individuals with extremist ideologies from entering the country. As threats to national security evolve and become more sophisticated, it is imperative for law enforcement agencies to adapt their strategies and tactics to effectively counter these emerging challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent apprehension of a terror suspect at the border underscores the urgent need for policymakers to prioritize national security and strengthen border control measures. Senator Daines\u2019s strong words serve as a reminder of the gravity of the situation and the importance of taking decisive action to address these pressing concerns.

The bank\u2019s research report, published on Tuesday, highlights that the next eight months leading up to the election are likely to be particularly disruptive for investors.\n\n\u201cThere are significant market implications arising from the stark contrast in the policies promulgated by the two candidates for president,\u201d the bank wrote.\n\nThe report outlines four potential election outcomes and their potential impact on the stock market:\n\nBlue Sweep: A complete democratic takeover could lead to a corporate tax hike and increased regulatory pressures, potentially negatively impacting equities.\n\nBiden wins, Congress splits: This scenario, similar to the current legislative setup, could result in a muted market impact.\n\nSee Also: Biden\u2019s Approval Rating Hits Rock Bottom As Inflation Victory Claim Fails To Resonate: Poll Analyst Sees \u2018Political Peril\u2019 For President\n\nLoading...

However, Trump\u2019s trade policies could counteract these gains.\n\nTrump wins, Congress splits: Under this scenario, financial markets would experience less tailwinds, but regulation would still be looser than under Biden.\n\nWhy It Matters: The 2024 presidential election has been a major focus for investors, with the stock market potentially being influenced by the political climate, as experts have suggested.\n\nThe election year has also seen a record-high stock market, with both Biden and Trump attributing this to their potential return to the White House.\n\nHowever, the stock market, which has been on a record-breaking spree, may be on the verge of a correction, according to a leading research firm. Ned Davis Research (NDR) has cautioned that the current market conditions could lead to a correction, although a bear market is not imminent. When this excessive optimism wanes and the sentiment composite dips into neutral mode, the MSCI ACWI tends to decline, NDR said. \u201c[W]ith the one-year and four-year cycles becoming less favorable, a correction can be expected,\u201d NDR added.\n\nRead Next: Hedge Fund Manager Says Republicans Are Committing \u2018Political Suicide\u2019 Ahead Of 2024 Election\u2026 Here\u2019s Why\n\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump.

            "text": "President Biden\u2019s reelection campaign is eyeing North Carolina as a state to flip in 2024, a place where former President Trump barely eked out a win the last time the two went head-to-head.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign acknowledges it will \u201ctake relentless effort\u201d to reach every voter it can by November, the Tar Heel State is seen as an opportunity, especially given a gubernatorial race that could boost Biden.\n\nBut strategists question how feasible that goal is, given the state hasn\u2019t gone to a Democrat since 2008 and went to Trump in his last two White House bids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still aspirational, but the state is definitely in play,\u201d said GOP strategist Doug Heye. \u201cTrump should win it. If I were betting on it, I would bet Trump would win.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina is part of the Biden campaign\u2019s pathway-to-270 strategy through critical swing states, which include the so-called blue wall made up of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; western battlegrounds including Nevada and Arizona; and southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina is included as part of a $30 million six-week advertising blitz the campaign announced after the State of the Union address to spend big in battleground states. Biden recently did radio interviews around Super Tuesday in Fayetteville and Charlotte to reach Black North Carolinians, one of several voting factions key to another victory.\n\nBiden and Vice President Harris will travel to North Carolina on March 26 as part of their effort to travel to every battleground state in March.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians know that while President Biden is fighting for us, Donald Trump is fighting for billionaires, corporations, and an extreme agenda that hurts our families and our economy,\u201d Biden campaign\u2019s North Carolina communications director Dory MacMillan told The Hill. \u201cOur campaign will continue to communicate across every corner of this state to reject Trump\u2019s attacks on our families and earn four more years of progress with President Biden.\u201d\n\nThe campaign currently has a $155 million war chest, but aside from spending and infrastructure, a major factor that strategists say can help Biden in the Tar Heel State is the governor\u2019s race, which includes far-right Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson on the ballot.\n\n\u201cGiven the very weak Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina and a very sophisticated operation from the Democratic candidate, the Biden team will have an even better opportunity to win there this time around because of the demographic shifts and a robust coordinated campaign in a state he barely lost,\u201d said Michael LaRosa, first lady Jill Biden\u2019s traveling press secretary during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMike Lonergan, the communications director for Mark Robinson for Governor, criticized Biden and Robinson\u2019s Democratic opponent Josh Stein in a statement to The Hill, saying Stein \u201cstands with President Biden\u2019s open-borders policies and would turn North Carolina into a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants; and he\u2019s backed by far-left radicals that want to defund the police.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cThe Democrats will stop at nothing to smear Mark Robinson because they know North Carolina voters have had enough of extremism and lies from career politicians like Joe Biden and Josh Stein.\u201d\n\nTrump barely beat Biden in North Carolina last time around by less than 1 percentage point. The last Democrat to win the state in a presidential contest was then-Democratic nominee Barack Obama, but he lost his reelection bid there to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by 2 percentage points. Trump won the state when he ran for the White House the first time in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points.\n\nAn aggregation of polls shows Trump with a 7.4 point lead over Biden in North Carolina, a wider lead than the former president has managed in other battleground states.\n\n2024 could prove to be a split-ticket situation in North Carolina, where Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Stein wins while Trump takes the state, considering that when Trump won the state in 2020, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was reelected to a second term.\n\nThe GOP nominee for superintendent, who would oversee the public schools in North Carolina, is also troubling to some moderate Republicans. Social media posts have emerged of Michele Morrow calling for former President Obama to be publicly executed, CNN reported.\n\nGiven the slate of Republican candidates, Democrats believe pouring efforts into North Carolina is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart bet,\u201d said Ivan Zapien, former official at the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Republicans have nominated some down-ballot candidates that are not going to do well in the suburbs, assuming the suburbs perform like they have been performing [in] the last cycles. It\u2019s ripe for a pickup.\u201d\n\nStill, Democrats acknowledge it\u2019s an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is ripe to flip, but it\u2019s still North Carolina,\u201d LaRosa said.\n\nRepublicans like Heye, a North Carolina native, say the state\u2019s not a forgone conclusion given its demographic developments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an outside chance that the Democrats take it because of the closeness of the state, because of the fast growth in the state, particularly in two parts \u2014 Charlotte and Raleigh and their suburban areas,\u201d he said.\n\nGrowth in areas like Charlotte and Raleigh has comprised an uptick in young, professional, suburban women, who helped give Democrats better-than-expected results in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nBlack voters are also a pivotal voting bloc in North Carolina, which is home to 11 historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nJim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, compared North Carolina to Georgia, a state that helped push Biden over the edge in 2020 in large part because of support from Black voters.\n\n\u201cThey each have a growing share of college-educated voters that have become essential for Democrats. Georgia has more African American voters, which proved to be the difference in 2020, but North Carolina is starting to look like the kind of state where Democrats should prevail,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was updated at 8:57 p.m.\n\nFOLLOW US ON GOOGLE NEWS\n\nRead original article here",

Trump is also ahead in Nevada, holding a 5.7 percent lead, according to an aggregation of polls.\n\nThe president earlier on Tuesday, while in Nevada, defended his low poll numbers and said that in the last few national polls, he was beating Trump. He called the press all \u201cgood guys,\u201d as some Democrats have pushed back on the media\u2019s focus on the president\u2019s poor polling numbers against Trump.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Democratic Party has ramped up its attacks on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in recent days, marking the first significant attempt by either party to shape voter sentiment around his candidacy ahead of a potential rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has taken multiple steps in recent days to portray Kennedy as a spoiler who would help Republican frontrunner Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden, arguing Kennedy is funded primarily by wealthy donors aligned with the former president.\n\nLast week, the DNC filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Kennedy\u2019s campaign had illegally coordinated with American Values 2024, a PAC backing his White House bid. Kennedy\u2019s campaign has denied coordinating with the group.\n\nIn a call with reporters outlining the complaint, DNC adviser Ramsey Reid blamed Trump and his donors for turning Kennedy into a \u201cstalking horse\u201d by funding the PAC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that Donald Trump is disrespecting the democratic process. It\u2019s pretty clear that Trump and his megadonors are propping up RFK Jr. as a stalking horse,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe DNC has homed in on donations to the PAC from billionaire Tim Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking fortune who has been a prolific donor to pro-Trump and other GOP causes over the years. Mellon gave approximately $15 million to American Values 2024 last year. In 2020, he gave $20 million to America First Action Inc., one of the leading outside groups backing Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nOn Saturday, as Kennedy held a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the DNC advertised on four billboards around the area accusing Kennedy of being \u201cpowered by MAGA/Trump.\u201d And after the Kennedy-aligned PAC released a new TV ad during the Super Bowl that repurposed an old spot from the 1960 campaign of President John F. Kennedy, the candidate\u2019s uncle, the DNC issued a statement highlighting the PAC\u2019s funding from Mellon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump\u2019s largest donor this cycle,\u201d DNC rapid response director Alex Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the ad aired Sunday.\n\nKennedy\u2019s team pushed back on the Democratic attacks, saying that donors \u201cfrom across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,\u201d Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDNC adviser Lis Smith told CNN the party\u2019s latest efforts are meant to educate voters on the connections between Trump and Kennedy, while acknowledging the critical role Kennedy could play in the general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Donald Trump and his allies view him as a useful stalking horse who could help throw the election to Trump in November,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile his independent campaign faces steep odds of success, Kennedy\u2019s candidacy could influence the outcome of a Biden-Trump rematch if he garners enough support in critical states. In the 2020 election, Biden flipped three states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin \u2013 by margins of less than 1%. Recent national polling of a Trump-Biden rematch suggests the race could be narrowly decided again. A CNN/SSRS poll released earlier this month showed Trump with 49% support among registered voters, compared with 45% for Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear as of now how Kennedy would affect a potential general election between Biden and Trump \u2013 whether he\u2019d draw more support from historically Republican or Democratic voters, or whether he\u2019d receive enough total support to influence the election either way. An NBC News poll released this month found 34% of registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s allies have targeted Biden and Democrats as they look to gain traction in the race, a sign they\u2019re ready to meet the DNC\u2019s escalating attacks straight ahead. In a statement released after the Super Bowl ad, American Values 2024 co-founder Mark Gorton criticized the DNC for its efforts targeting Kennedy.\n\n\u201cThe only argument the DNC has left is that Biden is not Trump. When RFK Jr. gets on the ballot, the American public will have the ability to choose a candidate who is not Trump, who has integrity, bravery, a proven track record of fighting corporate corruption, and the ability to stand up to the corporate interests that have taken over the Biden administration. The American people are waking up, and the DNC\u2019s only hope is to prevent them from having a choice,\u201d Gorton said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and David Wright contributed to this report.",

Right: President Joe Biden speaks in Milwaukee, Wis., August 15, 2023.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee chairman James Comer (R., Ky.) will soon be inviting President Joe Biden to testify about his family\u2019s business dealings for the House GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nTwo of Hunter Biden\u2019s former business partners, Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis, testified on Wednesday to discuss the president\u2019s alleged role in his son\u2019s foreign business enterprise. At the end of the hearing Comer announced his plans to invite President Biden to testify himself.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days, I will invite President Biden to the House Oversight Committee to provide his testimony and explain why his family received tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies with his assistance,\u201d Comer announced. He did not specify whether he would issue a subpoena to the White House to compel testimony from Joe Biden.\n\nWhite House spokesman Ian Sams mocked Comer\u2019s announcement as a \u201cstunt\u201d and dismissed the impeachment inquiry.\n\nHunter Biden did not attend the hearing on Wednesday after previously having demanded that House Republicans allow him to testify publicly. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, told Comer last week that his client would not appear for the public hearing because it was designed to be a media circus. Devon Archer, a former Biden business partner and key witness in the impeachment inquiry, also declined to show up for the public hearing.\n\nIn closed-door testimony last month, Hunter Biden confirmed that his father met foreign business partners and spoke to business associates on speakerphone, corroborating significant portions of Archer\u2019s and Bobulinski\u2019s testimony. Nonetheless, he repeatedly insisted that Joe Biden played no role in his business dealings.\n\nJoe Biden himself has repeatedly denied having had any involvement with Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas dealings. The White House has disparaged and dismissed the impeachment inquiry on numerous occasions.\n\nThe extent of Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in his son\u2019s business enterprise during and after his vice presidency is the focus of the House GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Evidence gathered by the impeachment inquiry includes bank records, witness testimony, texts, emails, images, and other documents relevant to the investigation. Republican investigators have scrutinized Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with individuals and entities in Ukraine, China, Russia, Romania, and Kazakhstan.\n\nAt the hearing, Bobulinski suggested that Joe Biden committed various crimes by assisting his son with his business dealings and voiced his support for impeaching the president. Most Notably, Bobulinski accused Hunter Biden and his uncle Jim of lying under oath about their business dealings with Chinese conglomerate CEFC.\n\nSimilarly, Galanis claimed that Hunter Biden had used his father to help close lucrative business deals and mentioned how Hunter leveraged the \u201cBiden lift,\u201d a term used by Galanis to describe access to Joe Biden.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss is prosecuting Hunter Biden for alleged federal gun and tax crimes committed in Delaware and California. Lowell claimed that Hunter Biden\u2019s court date in California on Thursday conflicted with the timing of the hearing.\n\nMore on National Review\n\nNews Related",

            "text": "\u201eEr hat genug Misserfolge hinter sich\u201c: Biden muss Wahl mehr f\u00fcrchten als das Amtsenthebungsverfahren\n\nDrucken Teilen\n\nDer Vorsitzende des House Oversight Committee James Comer (R-Ky.), rechts, und der rangh\u00f6chste Demokrat des Gremiums, Repr\u00e4sentant Jamie Raskin (Md.), am Mittwoch. \u00a9 Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post\n\nDie Republikaner wollen Biden aus dem Amt dr\u00e4ngen. Doch das Verfahren liegt so gut wie auf Eis \u2013 aus Mangel an Beweisen. Die Wahl ist viel gef\u00e4hrlicher.\n\nWashington \u2013 Das Verfahren zur Amtsenthebung von Pr\u00e4sident Joe Biden kommt nicht voran. Zwar hielten die Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses eine Anh\u00f6rung ab und pr\u00e4sentierten Zeugen, die die d\u00fcnnen Behauptungen wiederholten, dass Mitglieder der Familie Biden aus dem Namen ihres Vaters finanziell Kapital schlugen. Doch ob das reicht, um den Mann im Wei\u00dfen Haus auf diese Weise zu Fall zu bringen? Die Zweifel werden immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer.\n\nAmtsenthebungsverfahren gegen Joe Biden: Republikaner haben Probleme mit Beweisen\n\nDer Vorsitzende des House Oversight Committee, James Comer, hatte die Ermittlungen gegen Biden im vergangenen Jahr mit Anschuldigungen wegen schwerer Verbrechen und Vergehen eingeleitet, die die Republikaner seither nur mit M\u00fche unterst\u00fctzen konnten. F\u00fcnfzehn Monate sp\u00e4ter haben die Republikaner im Kongress keine Beweise oder Zeugenaussagen erhalten, die belegen, dass Joe Biden direkt an den Gesch\u00e4ften seines Sohnes Hunter Biden beteiligt war oder davon profitierte.\n\nUnd obwohl einige von Hunter Bidens engen Mitarbeitern seinen Vater in die N\u00e4he der an einigen Gesch\u00e4ften Beteiligten ger\u00fcckt haben \u2013 was die Behauptungen des Pr\u00e4sidenten, er habe nichts von Hunters Aktivit\u00e4ten gewusst, untergr\u00e4bt \u2013, entsprach keine der Anschuldigungen den Vorw\u00fcrfen der Republikaner, Hunter Bidens gesch\u00e4ftliche Aktivit\u00e4ten h\u00e4tten eine Einflussnahme erm\u00f6glicht, die Joe Biden und seine Familie bereichert habe.\n\nMit ihrer knappen Mehrheit ben\u00f6tigen die Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus nahezu Einstimmigkeit, um ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren gegen den Pr\u00e4sidenten zu verabschieden, was sie nicht haben. Stattdessen ist die Skepsis unter den Republikanern nur noch gewachsen, seit ein FBI-Informant angeklagt wurde, \u00fcber die Bidens gelogen zu haben, wodurch das, was als wichtiges Beweisst\u00fcck pr\u00e4sentiert worden war, ins Wanken geriet.\n\nThe Washington Post vier Wochen gratis lesen Ihr Qualit\u00e4ts-Ticket der washingtonpost.com: Holen Sie sich exklusive Recherchen und 200+ Geschichten vier Wochen gratis.\n\nDie Zweifel wachsen: Joe Biden muss die Amtsenthebung wohl nicht f\u00fcrchten\n\nIn Ermangelung dieser Stimmen haben sich Comer und andere Mitglieder der Untersuchungsaussch\u00fcsse auf die M\u00f6glichkeit einer Strafanzeige verlegt. Comer hat gedroht, \u201emehrere\u201c Strafanzeigen zu stellen, aber es bleibt unklar, ob die Gesetzgeber Pr\u00e4sident Biden formell eines Verbrechens beschuldigen werden und welche Verbrechen sie ihm vorwerfen.\n\n\u201eIch bin mir nicht sicher, wie wir den Pr\u00e4sidenten strafrechtlich belangen k\u00f6nnen, ohne ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren anzustrengen\u201c, sagte Abgeordneter Kelly Armstrong. \u201eIch meine, das [Justizministerium] wird das sowieso nie in Angriff nehmen.\u201c\n\nArmstrong, Mitglied des Justizausschusses des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses, f\u00fcgte hinzu, dass der Ausschuss gegen mehrere Zeugen, die vor dem Ausschuss ausgesagt haben, Strafverfahren wegen Verst\u00f6\u00dfen gegen den Foreign Agents Registration Act einleiten k\u00f6nnte. Hunter Biden, der es ablehnte, am Mittwoch zu erscheinen, sieht sich neun strafrechtlichen Anklagen in einem seit langem andauernden Bundessteuerfall und Anklagen wegen Waffenbesitzes gegen\u00fcber.\n\n\u201eMeine Meinung zu einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren im Allgemeinen? Es ist eine sehr hohe Messlatte, die sie erf\u00fcllen m\u00fcssen, und sie m\u00fcssen ihre Kollegen davon \u00fcberzeugen, dass es das Richtige ist\u201c, sagte der Abgeordnete Brian Fitzpatrick. \u201eWenn sie es ablehnen, ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren einzuleiten, ist das meiner Meinung nach die richtige Entscheidung.\u201c\n\nViele Anschuldigungen der Republikaner gegen Biden verpuffen\n\nDem offensichtlichen Zusammenbruch einer der wichtigsten Ermittlungen der Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus ging eine Reihe von Vorf\u00e4llen voraus, bei denen Comer, der sogar von einigen republikanischen Kollegen f\u00fcr seine Fox-News-zentrierte Herangehensweise an die Ermittlungen kritisiert wurde, Anschuldigungen gegen Biden und seinen Sohn erhob, bevor sie \u00f6ffentlich verpufften. Abgeordneter Jamie Raskin, der rangh\u00f6chste Demokrat im Oversight Committee, nannte die Anh\u00f6rung in seiner Er\u00f6ffnungsrede am Mittwoch \u201edas Ende des vielleicht spektakul\u00e4rsten Scheiterns in der Geschichte der Untersuchungen des Kongresses\u201c.\n\nTony Bobulinski, ein ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner von Hunter Biden, sagt am Mittwoch vor dem House Oversight Committee aus. \u00a9 Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post\n\n\u201eUnsere Kollegen bereiten sich jetzt offenbar darauf vor, ihr Gesicht zu wahren, indem sie die Amtsenthebungsfarce mit Strafantr\u00e4gen beenden\u201c, sagte Raskin. \u201eAber strafrechtliche Verweise erfordern Beweise f\u00fcr Verbrechen. Und die einzigen Verbrechen, die wir gesehen haben, sind die der eigenen Kronzeugen der Grand Old Party.\u201c\n\nJede Strafanzeige, die der Kongress an das Justizministerium richtet, w\u00e4re ein symbolischer Akt, der f\u00fcr sich genommen kein rechtliches Gewicht hat und den Staatsanw\u00e4lten die Entscheidung \u00fcberl\u00e4sst, ob sie Anklage erheben. Aber eine strafrechtliche Verweisung k\u00f6nnte die Feststellungen des Oversight Committee so deutlich wie m\u00f6glich zum Ausdruck bringen und den Republikanern, die versucht haben, unbegr\u00fcndete Behauptungen und Theorien \u00fcber Biden und seine Familie zu legitimieren, als Kommunikationsmittel dienen.\n\nEinige Mitglieder deuteten an, dass sie bereit seien, alle neuen Beweise, die die Ermittler des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses in der Zwischenzeit ans Tageslicht bringen k\u00f6nnten, zu pr\u00fcfen. Der Abgeordnete Mike Garcia merkte jedoch an, dass den Republikanern vor dem R\u00fcckkampf zwischen Biden und dem ehemaligen Pr\u00e4sidenten Donald Trump die Zeit davonlaufe - und dass Biden vor gr\u00f6\u00dferen Herausforderungen bei den Wahlen stehe als vor einem m\u00f6glichen Amtsenthebungsverfahren, das in einem von den Demokraten kontrollierten Senat scheitern d\u00fcrfte.\n\nDie Wahl gegen Donald Trump ist f\u00fcr Biden das viel gr\u00f6\u00dfere Problem\n\n\u201eLetztendlich wird das amerikanische Volk im Oktober oder November dar\u00fcber abstimmen, ob dieser Pr\u00e4sident f\u00fcr das Amt geeignet ist oder nicht\u201c, sagte Garcia. \u201eIch denke, er hat schon genug andere Herausforderungen und Misserfolge hinter sich, so dass ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren wahrscheinlich nicht einmal das Wahlergebnis beeinflussen w\u00fcrde\u201c.\n\nTony Bobulinski, ein ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner von Hunter Biden, und Jason Galanis, der wegen mehrfachen Betrugs eine fast 16-j\u00e4hrige Haftstrafe in Montgomery, Alabama, verb\u00fc\u00dft, sagten beide bei der Anh\u00f6rung am Mittwoch auf Gehei\u00df der Republikaner aus. Sie behaupteten beide, dass Joe Biden in die gesch\u00e4ftlichen Aktivit\u00e4ten seiner Familienmitglieder verwickelt war, bevor sie Details \u00fcber begrenzte Interaktionen mit Joe Biden angaben, um die Behauptungen zu untermauern.\n\nBobulinski verwies auf ein Treffen mit Joe Biden im Mai 2017, das von Hunter Biden und dem Bruder des Pr\u00e4sidenten, James, arrangiert worden war, als Beweis daf\u00fcr, dass Joe Biden von den Gesch\u00e4ften seines Sohnes mit ausl\u00e4ndischen Unternehmen wusste. Doch als Bobulinski am Mittwoch zu dem Treffen befragt wurde, erw\u00e4hnte er bei der Beschreibung des 45-min\u00fctigen Treffens in Los Angeles nicht ausdr\u00fccklich das Streben nach einem Gesch\u00e4ft mit CEFC, einem chinesischen Energiekonglomerat.\n\n\u201eWir sprachen \u00fcber meinen Hintergrund, den milit\u00e4rischen Hintergrund meiner Familie, die verschiedenen gesch\u00e4ftlichen Unternehmungen, die ich auf der ganzen Welt unternommen hatte, die Familie, mit der ich zusammenarbeitete - Joe verbrachte Zeit damit, \u00fcber seine Familie zu sprechen, \u00fcber einige der Trag\u00f6dien, die sie durchlebt hatten\u201c, beschrieb Bobulinski das Gespr\u00e4ch mit Joe Biden, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht im Amt war.\n\nRepublikaner pr\u00e4sentieren zweifelhafte Zeugen im Amtsenthebungsverfahren\n\nGalanis, der per Zoom vom Gef\u00e4ngnis aus aussagte, beschrieb auch eine \u201erelativ kurze Diskussion\u201c mit dem damaligen Vizepr\u00e4sidenten Biden im Mai 2014, nachdem Hunter Biden auf einer Party Galanis und eine kleine Gruppe von Personen - darunter die russische Milliard\u00e4rin Jelena Baturina und ihr Ehemann Juri Luschkow sowie Hunter Bidens ehemaliger Gesch\u00e4ftspartner Devon Archer \u2013 beiseite genommen und Joe Biden \u00fcber den Lautsprecher angerufen hatte. Galanis behauptete, dass es in dem Gespr\u00e4ch um den bevorstehenden Besuch von Baturina und Luschkow in Washington ging und \u201esie dar\u00fcber sprachen, gut zu seinem Jungen zu sein\u201c. Auf die Frage, ob es bei diesem Anruf darum ging, dass Hunter Biden potenziellen Investoren \u201eZugang zur Marke Biden\u201c verschaffte, antwortete Galanis, dass dies der Fall sei.\n\nDer Abgeordnete Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) nannte w\u00e4hrend der Anh\u00f6rung Unstimmigkeiten zwischen den Aussagen von Mitgliedern der Familie Biden und den Aussagen von Bobulinski und Galanis als m\u00f6gliche Grundlage f\u00fcr eine weitere strafrechtliche Verweisung: L\u00fcgen gegen\u00fcber dem Kongress. Nach der Anh\u00f6rung verteidigte Palmer den Prozess des Oversight Committee und warnte, dass die Mitglieder noch Zeit h\u00e4tten, ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren in Betracht zu ziehen.\n\n\u201eIch denke, wir m\u00fcssen sehr \u00fcberlegt und sorgf\u00e4ltig vorgehen, denn es geht um das Leben vieler Menschen. Mein Ziel ist es nicht, jemanden zu erwischen, mein Ziel ist es, die Wahrheit herauszufinden\u201c, sagte Palmer.\n\nDie Anh\u00f6rung wurde zeitweise sehr kontrovers gef\u00fchrt. Als die Abgeordnete Lisa C. McClain versuchte, den Ruf von Hunter Biden zu schm\u00e4lern, indem sie ihn sp\u00f6ttisch als \u201egoldenes Kind\u201c bezeichnete, lachte die Abgeordnete Ayanna Pressley und murmelt, dass McClains Kommentar \u201ereich\u201c sei. \u201eSchauen Sie sich Ihre Partei an\u201c, f\u00fcgte Pressley hinzu. \u201eG\u00f6nnen Sie mir eine Pause.\u201c\n\nAn einem Punkt forderte der Abgeordnete Jared Moskowitz Comer auf, einen Antrag auf ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren gegen Biden zu stellen. \u201eWann k\u00f6nnen wir dem amerikanischen Volk sagen, dass Sie aufh\u00f6ren werden, Ihr Geld zu verschwenden und einfach die Abstimmung \u00fcber ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren beantragen?\u201c, sagte Moskowitz.\n\n\u201eWir machen keine Schnellabstimmungen wie ihr\u201c, entgegnete der Vorsitzende des Justizausschusses Jim Jordan.\n\nDemokraten bezichtigen die Republikaner der L\u00fcge\n\nMehrere Demokraten warfen den Republikanern vor, eine Anh\u00f6rung zu einem Amtsenthebungsverfahren abzuhalten, das zum Teil auf der Grundlage einer Behauptung eingeleitet wurde, von der die Beh\u00f6rden inzwischen sagen, sie sei unwahr. Der Sonderstaatsanwalt David Weiss, der zuvor Strafanzeige gegen Hunter Biden erstattet hatte, k\u00fcndigte im vergangenen Monat eine Anklage gegen einen FBI-Informanten an, dessen Behauptungen Comer als grundlegendes Beweisst\u00fcck in der Amtsenthebungsuntersuchung angepriesen hatte, weil er angeblich das FBI angelogen hatte.\n\nComer und Senator Chuck Grassley hatten im vergangenen Fr\u00fchjahr unbegr\u00fcndete Behauptungen von Alexander Smirnow - einer ehemaligen vertraulichen Quelle des FBI - aus dem Jahr 2020 aufgedeckt, wonach Biden in ein Bestechungsprogramm verwickelt gewesen sei, und das FBI aufgefordert, das Dokument mit Smirnows Behauptungen vorzulegen. Die von Smirnov erhobenen Behauptungen wurden zuvor vom FBI unter dem damaligen Generalstaatsanwalt William P.

Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said the updated policy would lead to a future \"powered by cleaner energy\" leveraging \"American ingenuity and technology.\"Speaking against a backdrop that included electric vehicles (EVs) and an American flag, Regan was joined by environmental groups, a key auto industry lobby supporting the policy and an EPA colleague from the agency's environmental justice wing who emphasized improvements in air quality in largely non-white communities near heavy industry and highways.But the policy drew criticism from Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the American Petroleum Institute, which threatened litigation to block changes that \"will unequivocally eliminate most new gas cars... from the US market in less than a decade.\"Biden's final tailpipe emission rules -- likely to be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- require a nearly 50% drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.The rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to incentivize EV sales and build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities, highlight environmental issues in November's election.Trump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.Biden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.\"I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,\" said Biden in a statement, touting \"historic progress.\"Alluding to his target set three years ago that 50% of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted,\"we'll meet my goal.\"- Industry given more time -EVs accounted for 7.6% in 2023 sales, up from 5.9% in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.The original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67% of new vehicle sales by 2032.Carmakers criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.Regulators then decided to allow manufacturers a \"variety of pathways\" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.This path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.Biden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.Moderating the targets in these first three years \"was the right call,\" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers, who appeared at Wednesday's event with Regan.\"These adjusted EV targets -- still a stretch goal -- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,\" said Bozzella.- Litigation ahead? -The final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.Wednesday's initiative won praise from the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules \"take us in the right direction.\"However, Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, said \"the EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers.\"The petroleum lobby was hardly happy with the final result.\"This regulation will make new gas-powered vehicles unavailable or prohibitively expensive for most Americans,\" said a statement from API and a trade group representing oil refineries, which vowed to mount a court challenge.jmb/sms",

Democrats fear growing opposition at home could hurt his chances in November's presidential election.\n\nNetanyahu said in a statement after the call that he had reiterated \"Israel's commitment to achieving all of the war's objectives.\"\n\nThe Israeli premier cited the objectives as eliminating Hamas, release of all the hostages and \"ensuring that Gaza will never present a threat to Israel.\"\n\nHe also pointed to the provision of \"essential humanitarian aid that helps achieve these aims.\"\n\nIsrael began relentless bombardment in Gaza, alongside a ground offensive, after Palestinian militant group Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack, which left about 1,160 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.\n\nThe militants also seized hostages, around 130 of whom Israel believes remain in Gaza, including 33 presumed dead.\n\nNearly 32,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.\n\nAs tensions with Netanyahu escalated, Biden pointedly praised a \"good speech\" last week by Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling for new elections in Israel.\n\nWith the UN warning of imminent famine in Gaza, Biden earlier this month ordered the US military to start airdrops of food into the enclave, and is sending American forces to build a temporary port for maritime aid.",

            "text": "Anatomy Of The Tech-Industrial Complex\n\nAuthored by Josh Stylman via the Brownstone Institute,\n\nIn the news this week, there is a lot of controversy over the US House of Representatives voting on Bill HR7521 which gives the Executive Branch of government the power to control and/or censor the content on websites and apps that are considered to be foreign-owned.\n\nThe public debate centers around the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, which collects massive amounts of data and has remarkable influence over American citizens, especially kids. Proponents of the bill argue that TikTok is a danger to our sovereignty as a country because of its foreign ownership.\n\nOn the other hand, critics of the legislation assert that the bill enables the largest control grab since the Patriot Act, empowering the president with unilateral authority to determine which businesses are permitted to operate in the US.\n\nAs the TikTok question is taken up, it is timely for a review of the origins of our major tech platforms and an examination of their troubling interconnectedness with the federal government.\n\nOver the last few centuries it has been widely understood that power was generally acquired by leveraging rich natural resources, money, and/or a strong military. As globalization has evolved and humans across the planet have become interconnected with access to an unprecedented amount of information at their fingertips, one can make a case that the control of this information has become the most important weapon in the power arsenal. Whoever controls the narrative, sways public opinion, guides individual and group behaviors, and paves the way for powerful institutions and individuals alike.\n\nAs the TikTok debate highlights, it\u2019s evident in the Information Age that no one is more capable at framing and shaping events and ideas from a particular point of view or set of values than the large tech companies. These entities possess a worldwide audience of billions of people every minute of every day.\n\nMany, including me, have completely morphed their media habits over the last couple of decades and now look to social media as a guide for world events instead of reading newspapers. Cognitively, many of us know that in order for tech to provide personalized experiences that may seem more convenient in the short term, they may make ethical compromises related to transparency, data collection, privacy, user autonomy, and other exploitative practices designed to manipulate us.\n\nNevertheless, in aggregate, we tend to ignore these trade-offs. Whether it\u2019s swaying elections, pressuring for the mass experimentation on humans with novel drugs, or denying biology as a mere construct, given the sheer size of their audience combined with algorithmic and other technological capabilities, it is indisputable that Big Tech plays an outsized role to socially engineer our society.\n\nSometimes this stewardship comes from directing our attention to so-called experts whom we are supposed to follow for guidance. In other instances it\u2019s merely lying by omission by presenting only one side of the conversation to give the illusion of consensus. Recent examples include Covid, climate change, gender-affirming care, and a number of other social and political issues.\n\nOne might argue that if there really were legitimate dissenting views on any of these controversial topics, investigative journalists would surely be exposing the truth to us. After all, it is the sacred duty of the Fourth Estate to provide citizens with information to keep the power structure in check. I used to think that.\n\nEven if there are assiduous reporters working at large news organizations, it is obvious to anyone who\u2019s been watching the rampant censorship within Big Tech over the past few years that the institutions who distribute the stories to the public are subject to the oversight and control by the United States Government.\n\nThe prevailing wisdom in dissident circles is that social media platforms\u2019 censorship of voices unfriendly to government narratives represents some sort of recent institutional capture. But what if the oversight or pressure from the government to \u201ccontent moderate\u201d is not a result of recent capture and not a new phenomenon? What if it is a manifestation of a longer-standing government plan to fund the start-ups of these powerhouse companies with a view toward making nefarious use of them later?\n\nIf you think this sounds too far-fetched to be true, consider that the federal government that was recently found to collude with Big Tech to interfere with free speech is the very same institution that ran Operation Mockingbird, a covert CIA project designed to bribe individual journalists and worldwide media organizations in order to affect public opinion through the manipulation of news reporting.\n\nIn an investigative analysis by Carl Bernstein in 1977, the CIA admitted that at least 400 journalists and 25 large organizations around the world had secretly been bribed to create and distribute fake news stories on behalf of the agency. Since then, the technology that can be used to modify and even control our thinking has become orders of magnitude more powerful, refined, and sophisticated. Keep this in mind as we go through a quick thought exercise.\n\nBefore we do, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that even the mere possibility of the web being a trap hits close to home because not only do I absolutely love the Internet, but this field is how I\u2019ve supported myself and my family since I was a young man.\n\nWhen I started doing this work in the mid-90s, I thought I was a cynical person who asked critical questions, but in reality, I was a youthful wide-eyed optimist. I genuinely believed in the earnest notion of combining hard work with luck and in the idea of founders building independent world-changing companies.\n\nIn fairness, I do know many people who did just that. However, an exploration into the major tech companies which make possible the web\u2019s superpowers raises some questions about their roots, and whether their meteoric rises were in fact organic.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Amazon. Jeff Bezos\u2019 grandfather, Lawrence Preston (L.P.) Gise, was Director at the Atomic Energy Commission, and helped to form the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), from which ARPAnet evolved. During his tenure, Gise approved and provided funding for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) \u2013 which would eventually invent the Internet.\n\nIt makes sense that Bezos might grow up to have interest in this area. After all, if your grandfather was a founding father of the internet, I imagine you might be drawn to the web too. But why hasn\u2019t this part of the Amazon CEO\u2019s history been widely publicized?\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot about Bezos through the years and he\u2019s most often described simply as a hedge fund guy with a great idea. Perhaps that\u2019s true, but it is interesting that even puff pieces about Bezos learning his technical skill from his grandfather omit his forebear\u2019s early internet connections.\n\nThe Amazon founder gives other examples of his grandfather\u2019s work ethic and self-reliance. One summer, the two built a house from scratch and he also recalled helping his grandfather fix a broken bulldozer.\n\nIt is possible the author wanted to focus on the folksy DIY angle, but while \u201cPop\u201d Gise may have been a resourceful homesteader, he was also one of the pioneers of one of the most important technological innovations in human history \u2013 not to mention the infrastructure on which Jeff built his empire. If I were writing about how young Jeff was influenced by his grandfather, that feels quite relevant.\n\nInterestingly, Jeff\u2019s Wikipedia page mentions that his grandfather was \u201ca regional director of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque\u201d but it doesn\u2019t mention DARPA or the internet. Bezos\u2019 mother\u2019s entry doesn\u2019t even mention L.P. Gise by name. Is it plausible that these omissions are simply clumsy oversights?\n\nWhile Amazon ostensibly started out as an online bookseller, it has evolved into what can arguably be called a full-service data collection vehicle. They collect your personal information via your online store orders of items physical, virtual, and pharmaceutical. Amazon can see who is coming in and out of your living space with Ring, acquired in 2018, and has the technical capability to listen to conversations of more than half a billion people through Alexa devices installed in homes, offices and dorm rooms. Most recently, Amazon has added One Medical which provides 24/7 on-demand virtual care from \u201clicensed providers\u201d and for those who live near brick-and-mortar locations, in-person visits. Customers are assured that their information is confidential, but would it remain so should the government bring pressure on Amazon to give it up in an \u201cemergency?\u201d\n\nJust last year, Amazon settled a $30.8 million lawsuit for claims that it improperly retained children\u2019s Alexa voice recordings and Ring videos, along with related geolocation information, for years \u2013 in some cases without consent and despite requests by consumers for the data to be deleted. They also enabled employees of its Ring video unit to survey customers. One Ring employee viewed thousands of video recordings of female users of security cameras that monitored bedrooms and other private spaces in their homes, the Federal Trade Commission said in a complaint. In a separate incident, the company was recently fined in France for their rigorous employee surveillance program. That same intrusive system was also cited in a study as the cause of suffering physical injuries and mental stress on the job.\n\nPerhaps because of their embarrassing failures, Ring recently succumbed to pressure from privacy advocates who criticized them for letting police departments request users\u2019 footage without a warrant. They eventually did the right thing and respected their customer\u2019s privacy, but given Amazon\u2019s very close relationship to the federal government as a provider of cloud services, what happens when the lettered agencies call asking for warrantless audio and video footage from someone\u2019s private life?\n\nNow let\u2019s consider Google, a company that many people believe to be an unquestionably reliable source of facts and arbiter of truth. The popular origin story of the web search titan is that it was the brainchild of two scrappy boy-geniuses at Stanford who were looking for a better way to find and present the ever-growing depth and breadth of information being uploaded to the web.\n\nConspicuously missing from that official story is the part about how Google started in 1995 as a DARPA-funded grant project for the CIA & NSA joint Massive Digital Data Systems Program.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s Wikipedia page details the account of how they got seed funding from a few Silicon Valley luminaries, it fails to mention that some of the research that led to Google\u2019s ambitious creation was funded and coordinated by a research group established by the intelligence community to develop and implement ways to track individuals and groups online. If that part of the account hadn\u2019t been erased from the history books, do you think Google would have quickly gained the trust of billions of people around the world?\n\nWhile I never bought into their over-the-top \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d schtick, I naively believed that people leading the company were motivated primarily to improve the planet by offering global access to the world\u2019s information. Maybe that\u2019s true\u2026but, Google turned out to be a pretty darn good spying vehicle too.\n\nThere was a time when my unsophisticated brain thought the power Google maintained was merely to suck in all of our data to manipulate us with advertising, but it\u2019s become so much more. As their services have expanded to mail, geolocation, content publishing, AI, telecommunications, payments, and seemingly everything else one would need for managing all facets of their digital existence, it\u2019s become apparent that search was merely the on-ramp for their data capture enterprise.\n\nThis makes sense when you consider the central role search engines play in modern life. For the first time in human history, people in every country in the world willingly ask machines questions and perform queries about everything on their minds. These inquiries can range from mundane trivia to how-to content to more confidential things like highly private health concerns.\n\nGoogle\u2019s ties to intelligence have continued beyond the very early days of the company. In 2004 they bought Keyhole (now Google Maps) from In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u2019s investment arm also backed by the FBI, NGA, Defense Intelligence Agency, and others. Do you think this was a straight-up financial transaction or is it possible that there were strings attached?\n\nOther intel ties include Google and the CIA co-investing in assets like Recorded Future, which monitors the web in real time in an attempt to create a \u201ctemporal analytics engine\u201d (a Minority Report-style program that makes predictions about future events), and Google\u2019s participation \u2013 along with other tech giants \u2013 in the NSA\u2019s PRISM program, which collected data from users on their platform without users\u2019 permission or a search warrant. In 2006, the company launched Google Federal to serve government contracts. This division in the company had so many former NSA staffers that it was often referred to as NSA West.\n\nMore recently, it was uncovered that Google employs more than a few former CIA agents and other ex-high level government employees in key roles including those who determine \u201cwhat content is allowed\u201d on their platform.\n\nAs civilians, most of us think we\u2019re searching the entire web, but Google has acknowledged that they are presenting only what their censors, partially made up of former intel agents, decide is appropriate. Based on the PRISM revelations, it\u2019s also apparent that the content we do consume has, at least for a period, illegally been shared with our government. Sweet.\n\nTo further illustrate how internet companies can be quite cozy with government and intelligence agencies, consider these fun tangential facts related to the (pre-Google) early days of web search: Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s twin sisters, Christine and Isabel Maxwell were the founders of Magellan, one of the first search engines on the internet (eventually, acquired by Excite).\n\nAfter Magellan, Christine started Chiliad, a data mining company working with the CIA, NSA, DHS, and FBI on \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d efforts. During this time, Isabel\u2019s company Cyren (previously Commtouch) had some very sketchy ties to Microsoft and Silicon Valley companies, allegedly possessing a backdoor into them. Christine now serves as UK and US Technology Pioneer for the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe Maxwell sisters\u2019 father, Robert, was widely rumored to have ties to organizations including MI6, KGB, Mossad, and the CIA. It is not fair to surmise his entrepreneur daughters were in the espionage business by mere association with their father and infamous sister \u2013 or even because of their contracts with the intelligence agencies. Still, it feels noteworthy.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that since the early days of search all the way to the present, the fact that we often don\u2019t think about who or what is on the other side feeding the results in this curiously intimate relationship with the search bar is arguably a feature not a bug.\n\nIf search is the brain tapping into the collective consciousness of what people are looking for online, social media is the soul, monitoring and connecting users based on what they\u2019re sharing. The former is predicated on intent whereas the latter is more about identity and interests.\n\nWhile both can be used as tools to amass a trove of data, search is more transactional since the user performs a query, finds the results and moves on, whereas social is more about creating virality and binding people together through the social graph.\n\nThe Pentagon (specifically, DARPA) apparently foresaw the usefulness of collecting the breadcrumbs of people\u2019s behavior when they started working on LifeLog, a project to track a person\u2019s \u201centire existence\u201d online. It\u2019s ambiguous what happened but they shut the project down on Feb 4, 2004.\n\nAs fate would have it, that same day \u2013 February 4, 2004 \u2013 was the day that Facebook (then, TheFacebook) launched at Harvard. That is a weird coincidence that Aaron Sorkin didn\u2019t mention in the movie version, but it\u2019s probably nothing. DARPA even denied having a connection, so I guess we\u2019ll have to take them at their word.\n\nLike their cohorts at Google, Facebook seems to be hiring from the intelligence community at a rapid pace. Recruiting from agencies including the CIA, FBI, NSA, ODNI, as well as other government departments including DOJ, DHS, and GEC, Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, has hired more than 160 former intelligence employees since 2018. Collectively, many of these employees are involved in the so-called Trust & Safety team (naturally) determining what content gets amplified, fact-checked, and/or taken down entirely.\n\nWhen Matt Taibbi, Michael Shellenberger, and other journalists released the Twitter Files last year, it became unmistakable that Twitter was yet another Big Tech platform that had direct ties to the US surveillance apparatus.\n\nSimilar to Google and Facebook, they also had a number of ex-spooks under their employ, including an alarming number of FBI agents. It is unclear if and how Twitter (no, I still won\u2019t call it X) has been working with the government since Elon Musk took over.\n\nThere is, however, an overwhelming amount of evidence that prior to the acquisition, the government exerted influence on the company to create guardrails around the content that got presented and even flagged specific users as being potentially dangerous. That is a lot of power to wield in shaping the hearts and minds of the masses.\n\nThis might just be another odd synchronicity but Project Bluebird was the original codename for what became the government\u2019s MK Ultra Mind Control Program. Goals for Bluebird included \u201cobtaining accurate data from persons willing and unwilling\u201d and \u201cincrease compliance to suggested acts.\u201d It\u2019s interesting to consider that in the context of the iconic \u2013 and now retired \u2013 company logo. Who knows if that\u2019s just a creepy coincidence or some sort of signal that insiders have been aware of all along?\n\nSo, are all the official origin stories of tech companies finessed at best, entirely fabricated at worst? There sure are a lot of uncanny ties to the intelligence community and this essay just scratches the surface. Maybe they\u2019re all just coincidences but in doing a little research, these parallels caught my attention so I thought it worth pondering.\n\nIf the intent behind these organizations was always a myth, personally, I feel as duped as anyone. I worked in tech for decades before tapping out when realizing many of the people coming into the field were no longer idealists wanting to democratize the world\u2019s information. Instead, they operated more like cartoonish bastard children of Hollywood and Wall Street.\n\nStill, until the last few years, I didn\u2019t understand just how sinister these corporations might be in their participation in activities beyond generating a profit for their shareholders. For a while I\u2019ve understood the danger we face from the banksters, Big Needle, traditional media execs, etc., but I didn\u2019t truly comprehend that the world I thought I lived in was, in large part, an illusion. After all, we live in a society overrun with fake money, fake foods, fake news, fake wars, fake credentials, fake medicines, so why would the giant foundational companies on the Internet be any different?\n\nRegardless of whether the ascent of these Internet behemoths was a deception or not, they are now incontrovertibly in cahoots with the Data Industrial Complex. Whatever one might think of TikTok, the debate around whether it needs to be brought under US ownership or else banned does beg the question of why United States ownership is so crucial right now.\n\nIs there genuinely a national security risk being addressed or do legislators \u2013 and more importantly, their donors \u2013 simply want it to be under American jurisdiction so they can control it like they do the other large tech companies? I think Brownstone\u2019s Jeffrey Tucker best summarized our choices with this tweet the other day:\n\nIf there are any silver linings here, it is that many people are waking up and demanding transparency and authenticity \u2013 and seemingly no one is going to the other side. A truly woke society will be glorious. The only question is are there enough of us before the unsuspecting masses get so propagandized they morph into the borg. I sincerely believe this is one of the defining issues of our time.",

Much is still unexplored, but currently Palestine\u2019s Gaza and the West Bank between them show the greatest discoveries\u2026 (Felicity Arbuthnot, 2013)\n\nFlash Forward to October 2023\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s October 2023 declaration of war against 2.3 million people of the Gaza Strip is a continuation of its 2008-2009 invasion of Gaza under \u201cOperation Cast Lead.\u201d\n\nThe underlying objective is the outright military occupation of Gaza by Israel\u2019s IDF forces and the expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland.\n\nI should however mention that there are powerful financial interests which stand to benefit from Israel\u2019s criminal undertaking (Genocide) directed against Gaza.\n\n.\n\nThe ultimate objective is not only to exclude Palestinians from their homeland, it consists in confiscating the multi-billion dollar Gaza offshore Natural Gas reserves, namely those pertaining to the BG (BG Group) in 1999, as well the Levant discoveries of 2013.\n\nEgypt-Israel \u201cSecret Bilateral Talks\u201d\n\nIn 2021-22, Egypt and Israel were involved in \u201csecret bilateral talks\u201d regarding \u201cthe extraction of natural gas off the coast of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cEgypt succeeded in persuading Israel to start extracting natural gas off the coast of the Gaza Strip, after several months of secret bilateral talks.\n\nThis development \u2026 comes after years of Israeli objections to extract natural gas off the coast of Gaza on [alleged] security grounds, \u2026\n\nBritish Gas (BG Group) has also been dealing with the Tel Aviv government.\n\nWhat is significant is that the civilian arm of the Hamas Gaza government has been bypassed in regards to exploration and development rights over the gas fields:\n\nThe field, which lies about 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of the Gaza coast, was discovered in 2000 by British Gas (currently BG Group) and is estimated to contain more than 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe official in the Egyptian intelligence service told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity, \u201cAn Egyptian economic and security delegation discussed with the Israeli side for several months the issue of allowing the extraction of natural gas off the coast of Gaza. \u2026Al-Monitor, October 22, 2022\n\nA Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Egypt and Israel, which had the rubber-stamp of the Palestinian National Authority (PA):\n\n\u201cThe Egyptian official explained that Israel required the start of practical measures to extract gas from the Gaza fields at the beginning of 2024, to ensure its own security.

As such, the Palestinian people have been denied the benefits of using this natural resource to finance socioeconomic development and meet their need for energy.\n\nThe accumulated losses are estimated in the billions of dollars. The longer Israel prevents Palestinians from exploiting their own oil and natural gas reserves, the greater the opportunity costs and the greater the total costs of the occupation borne by Palestinians become.\n\nThis study identifies and assesses existing and potential Palestinian oil and natural gas reserves that could be exploited for the benefit of the Palestinian people, which Israel is either preventing them from exploiting or is exploiting without due regard for international law.

Their Objective Is \u201cto Wipe Gaza Off the Map\u201d?\n\nBy Philip Giraldi and Prof Michel Chossudovsky, October 20, 2023\n\nMichel Chossudovsky, Global Research, October 21, 2023\n\nBelow is the 2013 article by Felicity Arbuthnot\n\nIsrael Gas-Oil and Trouble in the Levant\n\nby Felicity Arbuthnot\n\nGlobal Research,\n\nDecember 13, 2013\n\nIsrael is set to become a major exporter of gas and some oil, if all goes to plan. The giant Leviathan natural gas field, in the eastern Mediterranean, discovered in December 2010, is widely described as \u201coff the coast of Israel.\u201d\n\nAt the time the gas field was:\n\n\u201c \u2026 the most prominent field ever found in the sub-explored area of the Levantine Basin, which covers about 83,000 square kilometres of the eastern Mediterranean region.\u201d (i)\n\nCoupled with Tamar field, in the same location, discovered in 2009, the prospects are for an energy bonanza for Israel, for Houston, Texas based Noble Energy and partners Delek Drilling, Avner Oil Exploration and Ratio Oil Exploration.\n\nAlso involved is Perth, Australia-based Woodside Petroleum, which has signed a memorandum of understanding for a thirty percent stake in the project, in negotiations which have been described as \u201cup and down.\u201d\n\nThere is currently speculation that Woodside might pull out of the deal: \u201c \u2026since the original plans to refrigerate the gas for export were pursued when relations between Israel and Turkey were strained. That has changed, more recently, which has opened the door for gas to be piped to Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe spoils of the Leviathan field has already expanded from an estimated 16.7 trillion cubic feet (tcf ) of gas to nineteen trillion \u2013 and counting:\n\n\u201dWe\u2019ve discovered nearly 40 tcf of gas, and we have roughly 19 tcf of that gas that\u2019s available for export to both regional and extra-regional markets. We see exports reaching 2 billion cubic feet a day in capacity in the next decade. And we continue to explore.\u201d, stated Noble Vice Chairman Keith Elliot (ii) There are also estimated to be possibly six hundred million barrels of oil, according to Michael Economides of energytribune.com (\u201cEastern Mediterranean Energy \u2013 the next Great Game.\u201d)\n\nHowever, even these estimates may prove modest. In their: \u201cAssessment of Undiscovered Oil and Gas Resources of the Levant Basin Province, Eastern Mediterranean\u201d, the US Department of the Interior\u2019s US Geological Survey, wrote in 2010:\n\n\u201cWe estimated a mean of 1.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil and a mean of 122 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas in this province using a geology based assessment methodology.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Woodside Petroleum, might also be hesitant to become involved in further disputes, since they are already embroiled, with the Australian government, in a protracted one in East Timor relating to the bonanaza of energy and minerals beneath the Timor Sea, which has even led to East Timor accusing Australia \u201cof bugging East Timorese officials during the negotiations over the agreement.\u201d(iii)\n\nWoodside\u2019s conflict in East Timor however, may well pale against what might well erupt over the Leviathan and Tamar fields. The area is not for nothing called the Levantine Basin.\n\nWhilst Israel claims them as her very own treasure trove, only a fraction of the sea\u2019s wealth lies in Israel\u2019s bailiwick as maps (iv, v, see below) clearly show.\n\nMuch is still unexplored, but currently Palestine\u2019s Gaza and the West Bank between them show the greatest discoveries, with anything found in Lebanon and Syria\u2019s territorial waters sure to involve claims from both countries.\n\nIn a pre-emptive move, on Christmas Day, Syria announced a deal with Russia to explore 2,190 kilometres (850 Sq. miles) for oil and gas off its Mediterranean coast, to be: \u201c\u2026 financed by Russia, and should oil and gas be discovered in commercial quantities, Moscow will recover the exploration costs.\u201d\n\nSyrian Oil Minister, Ali Abbas said during the signing ceremony that the contract covers \u201c25 years, over several phases.\u201d\n\nSyria, increasingly crippled by international sanctions, has seen oil production plummet by ninety percent since the largely Western fermented unrest began in March 2011. Gas production has nearly halved, from thirty million cubic metres a day, to 16.7 cubic metres daily.\n\nThe agreement is reported to have resulted from \u201cmonths of long negotiations\u201d between the two countries. Russia, as one of the Syrian government\u2019s main backers, looks set to also become a major player in the Levant Basin\u2019s energy wealth. (vi)\n\nLebanon disputes Israel\u2019s map of the Israeli-Lebanese maritime border, filing their own map and claims with the UN in 2010. Israel claims Lebanon is in the process of granting oil and gas exploration licenses in what Israel claims as its \u201cexclusive economic zone.\u201d\n\nThat the US in the guise of Vice President Joe Biden, as honest broker, acting peace negotiator in the maritime border dispute would be laughable, were it not potential for Israel to attack their neighbour again. In a visit to Israel in March 2010, Biden announced: \u201cThere is absolutely no space between the United States and Israel when it comes to Israel\u2019s security- none at all\u201d, also announcing on arrival in Israel:\u201dIt\u2019s good to be home.\u201d\n\nGiven US decades of \u201cpeace brokering\u201d between Israel and Palestine, this is already a road of pitfalls, one sidedness and duplicity, well traveled. There is trouble ahead.\n\nOh, and in demonology, Leviathan is one of the seven princes of Hell.\n\nNotes\n\n\n\ni. http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/leviathan-gas-field-levantine-israel/\n\nii. http://m.theage.com.au/business/options-widen-for-woodsides-leviathan-partners-20131219-2znu6.html\n\niii. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-04/east-timor-offers-funds-for-onshore- gas-processing/4933106\n\n\n\niv. http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/leviathan-gas-field-levantine-israel/leviathan-gas-field-levantine-israel1.html\n\n\n\nv. http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Leviathan+gas+project+Israel+map&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=ntC2UvO7IcPE7Ab7rIDYCQ&ved=0CEQQsAQ&biw=1017&bih=598\n\n\n\nvi. http://www.phantomreport.com/syria-inks-oil-gas-deal-with-russia-firm#more-20238\n\n",

The campaign further vowed that Trump would immediately strike down the regulations if he bests President Biden in their election rematch later this year.\n\n\"Joe Biden's extreme electric vehicle mandate will force Americans to buy ultra-expensive cars they do not want and cannot afford while destroying the U.S. auto industry in the process,\" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"This radical policy is anti-jobs, anti-consumer and anti-American.\"\n\n\"It will destroy the livelihoods of countless U.S. autoworkers while sending the U.S. auto industry to China. President Trump will reverse Joe Biden's extreme electric vehicle mandate on Day One.\"\n\nVULNERABLE HOUSE DEM BUCKS PARTY ORTHODOXY, BLASTING HIS STATE'S PROPOSED EV MANDATE\n\nThe statement comes months after Trump took aim at the Biden administration's climate agenda over its impact on blue-collar rank-and-file autoworkers. During the United Auto Workers strike last year, the former president said the best interests of American workers were his \"number one concern,\" and that a forced EV transition would destroy the U.S. auto industry.\n\nVIRGINIA DEMOCRATS UPHOLD STATE'S EV MANDATE DESPITE GROWING OPPOSITION: 'DEFY COMMON SENSE'\n\nMeanwhile, under the regulations unveiled Wednesday, the federal government will enforce the most stringent tailpipe emissions restrictions ever finalized beginning with model year 2027 light-duty and medium-duty vehicles. Those regulations are slated to progressively ramp up through 2032, forcing most new car purchases to be battery electric and plug-in hybrid within that time frame.\n\nIn one \"low cost\" model EPA outlined in the rule, administration officials said automakers would be forced to ensure 56% of light-duty car sales are battery electric and another 13% are hybrid by 2032, meaning nearly 70% of new cars would be zero-emissions or low-emissions by then.\n\n\"Three years ago, I set an ambitious target: that half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 would be zero-emission,\" Biden said in a statement after the regulations were posted Wednesday.\n\n\"I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,\" he said. \"Together, we\u2019ve made historic progress. Hundreds of new expanded factories across the country. Hundreds of billions in private investment and thousands of good-paying union jobs. And we\u2019ll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.\"\n\n130+ HOUSE, SENATE REPUBLICANS JOIN FORCES IN OPPOSITION OF BIDEN'S UPCOMING EV MANDATE\n\nThe EPA regulations, though, were immediately blasted by the energy industry, farm groups, consumer advocates and Republican lawmakers who vowed to pursue legislation aimed at overturning the rules.\n\nAccording to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an association that represents major automakers, 9.3% of total car purchases in the U.S. last year were electric or plug-in hybrids \u2014 up from 7% in 2022. That uptick was driven largely by purchases in California and urban areas where the majority of EV purchases are made.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the same time, EVs remain far more expensive than traditional, gas-powered cars. Even factoring in generous federal and state subsidies, the average cost of an EV is about $52,500, while the average subcompact car costs $24,000.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by Fox News Digital.",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Biden administration on Wednesday finalized one of the most significant pieces of its ambitious climate agenda: the strongest new tailpipe rules for passenger cars and trucks that will decisively push the US auto market toward electric vehicles and hybrids.\n\nBut in a concession to automakers and labor unions, the rules will be phased in more slowly than originally proposed and will give automakers more choices for how to comply.\n\nNearly a year ago, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a fast ramp-up into EVs \u2014 a rule that would have ensured two-thirds of all vehicles sold were electric by the end of this decade. The EPA pumped the brakes on that plan Wednesday.\n\nInstead of pushing automakers to sell more EVs to meet stringent pollution targets, the administration is allowing plug-in hybrids \u2014 vehicles that combine gas engines and EV-like batteries \u2014 to play a much bigger role in the electric transition.\n\nIn 2023, EVs made up just 7.6% of new car sales, according to Kelley Blue Book. The new rule is targeting 35% to 56% for EVs in 2032, and 13% to 36% for plug-in hybrids.\n\nTransportation has an outsized climate impact, making up nearly a third of all US climate pollution, so even small steps can lead to significant change. Margo Oge, who previously headed the agency\u2019s office of Transportation and Air Quality, called the new standard \u201cthe single most important climate regulation in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, President Joe Biden vowed the cars would be made by American workers. \u201cUS workers will lead the world on autos making clean cars and trucks, each stamped \u2018Made in America,\u2019\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d\n\nFederal officials said the rule doesn\u2019t favor electric vehicles over other types of vehicles, and will reduce nearly as much pollution as the original proposal \u2014 more than 7 billion metric tons of planet-warming emissions, along with other pollution that is detrimental to human health. By 2032, the new rule is expected to slash passenger car pollution nearly in half from 2026 levels.\n\n\u201cWithin those ranges, we got to the same place\u201d as the standard proposed last year, said Joe Goffman, who leads the agency\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation.\n\nGoffman said the agency considered different ways automakers could \u201cmix and match\u201d new vehicle models to meet the standard \u2014 by using more efficient gasoline engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cBy taking seriously the concerns of workers and communities, the EPA has created a more feasible emissions rule that protects workers building (traditional, gas-powered) vehicles, while providing a path forward for automakers to implement the full range of automotive technologies to reduce emissions,\u201d the United Auto Workers union said in a statement.\n\nWhite House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi said that \u201cone of the really strong features\u201d of the new rule was its flexibility.\n\n\u201cDifferent automakers are going to approach this in different ways,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have some automakers that maybe have a third of their fleet be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.\u201d Zaidi argued that would \u201ctranslate into a lot of consumer choice.\u201d\n\nCarmakers get flexibility\n\nAutomakers like Toyota, who are favoring hybrids and plug-in hybrids and moving slowly on EVs, could be big benefactors of EPA\u2019s new rule.\n\nToyota, the world\u2019s largest automaker, is among the companies that aggressively pushed back against the Biden administration\u2019s original proposal.\n\nIn a memo sent in the fall of 2023 to car dealers across the US, Toyota Motor North America group vice president of government affairs Stephen Ciccone described the EPA\u2019s original EV proposal as a \u201cmandate\u201d and \u201cdraconian,\u201d CNN recently reported. Ciccone wrote the proposal had caused an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d in the industry and suggested an option giving automakers more choice.\n\n\u201cToyota\u2019s position is that the best way to reduce carbon is by giving consumers a choice of powertrain options, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, fuel efficient ICE vehicles, and BEVs,\u201d Ciccone wrote.\n\nThat flexibility is what the EPA finalized on Wednesday. But Toyota continued to characterize EPA\u2019s rule as a \u201cregulatory mandate\u201d that will force it further into the EV game than it\u2019s currently positioned.\n\nThe rule \u201crequires a precipitous shift from around 8% market share of battery electric vehicles today to more than half by 2032 \u2013 an aggressive, sixfold increase over just eight years,\u201d said Toyota spokesperson Edward Lewis in a statement. \u201cToyota will continue to lead the industry and comply with regulations, but serious challenges around affordability, charging infrastructure, and supply chain will need to be addressed before this mandate is realized.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made the transition to EVs a signature issue of his presidency, stressing the economic impacts, in addition to the climate benefits, of cutting pollution. In August 2021, after the president announced an ambitious target that half of vehicles sold in the country by 2030 would be either battery electric, fuel-cell electric or plug-in hybrid, Biden test-drove a hybrid-electric Jeep on the White House grounds.\n\nBut political battle lines are being drawn around the EV transition. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, has railed against EVs in his speeches. He recently characterized EVs as \u201call\u201d being made in China, even though Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act has pushed a new EV manufacturing and assembly to the United States.\n\nWith the new standard giving automakers more flexibility, EPA administrator Michael Regan denounced the characterization that the agency was setting an EV \u201cmandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the differences between the proposal and final, you will see that there is absolutely no mandate,\u201d Regan told reporters, adding his agency was staying \u201cwell within the confines of the law.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump; the jump to EVs has some of Biden\u2019s political allies worried, too. The United Auto Workers, a powerful union that has endorsed Biden, has also expressed concerns about what the shift to EVs could mean for their workers, who believe battery-powered cars require less labor to build.\n\nBut the demand for fully electric cars is growing in the US. The nation crossed a key threshold at the end of last year: 1.2 million electric vehicles were sold \u2014 a 46.3% jump from 2022.\n\nEV adoption rates are likely to slow down this year, which is to be expected, said Trevor Houser, partner at the nonpartisan Rhodium Group. He\u2019s looking for two main signs of EV success in the coming years: whether automakers can make a wide enough variety of the vehicles Americans want to drive, and whether the cost can come down to a more affordable range of $20,000 to $30,000.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t really know before (2025) how successfully we\u2019re making that transition because the next generation of more affordable EVs won\u2019t be on the market,\u201d Houser told CNN.\n\nZaidi agreed it would take time to see whether more Americans move to fully electric cars.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ll see over time,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cBut this rule is very flexible and allows for all of those pathways to emerge, and for (automakers) to pursue those in a manner that\u2019s consistent with their strategies.\u201d\n\nClimate and health impacts\n\nWhile the climate impact of the tailpipe rules have drawn the most attention, there is a big public-health component, as well.\n\nReducing pollution from cars and trucks could help Americans\u2019 health on multiple levels, since the EPA\u2019s multi-pollutant standards will tackle greenhouse gases that cause climate change, smog and particle emissions.\n\nNo amount of air pollution is safe, and according to the World Health Organization, it\u2019s one of the greatest environmental risks to human health.\n\nVehicle exhaust is made up of all sorts of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and carbon emissions that contribute to a warming world, which is also itself a major threat to health.\n\nExposure to particle pollution ages and reduces lung function, and it can lead to cancer, stroke, heart problems, COPD and other lung and vascular issues. It can aggravate asthma and is linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and other types of dementia, studies have found. People exposed to higher amounts of this pollution for longer periods also have an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Exposure can even contribute to problems thinking clearly.\n\nParticle pollution led to more than 107,000 premature deaths in the US in just one year, one 2019 study found. That\u2019s more than the number of people killed each year in homicides and traffic accidents combined, researchers said.\n\n\u201cThese standards really provide significant relief that communities across America need from vehicle exhaust,\u201d said Will Barrett, the American Lung Association\u2019s senior director of advocacy for clean air. \u201cIt\u2019s very much setting a strong direction to ensuring the auto industry cleans up harmful pollutants and communities are better protected from traffic emissions.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Angela Dewan contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated what kind of vehicle Biden tested on White House grounds. It was a hybrid-electric Jeep.",

            "text": "Joe Biden Campaign Sets Sights On Flipping North Carolina In 2024\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s reelection campaign is considering North Carolina as a potential state to win in the 2024 election. In the previous election, former President Trump only managed to secure a narrow victory in this state.\n\nThe Biden campaign recognizes that it will require persistent effort to connect with every voter before November. The Tar Heel State presents a promising opportunity, particularly with a gubernatorial race that could provide a boost for Biden.\n\nHowever, strategists are skeptical about the feasibility of that goal. They point out that the state of [state] hasn\u2019t voted for a Democrat since 2008 and supported Trump in his last two presidential campaigns.\n\nAccording to GOP strategist Doug Heye, although it is still a goal to achieve, the state is undoubtedly up for grabs. Heye expressed confidence in Trump\u2019s chances of winning and even mentioned that if he were to place a bet, he would wager on Trump emerging victorious.\n\nNorth Carolina is a key component of the Biden campaign\u2019s plan to secure the necessary electoral votes to reach the 270 threshold. This strategy focuses on crucial swing states, including the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as western battlegrounds like Nevada and Arizona. Additionally, southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina are also part of this crucial pathway.\n\nCopy Copy\n\nNorth Carolina is part of a $30 million six-week advertising campaign that was announced after the State of the Union address. The campaign plans to spend a significant amount in battleground states. In an effort to connect with Black North Carolinians, a crucial voting group, Biden conducted radio interviews in Fayetteville and Charlotte around Super Tuesday. These interviews were aimed at reaching out to this important faction and securing another victory.\n\nOn March 26, Biden and Vice President Harris will be heading to North Carolina as part of their mission to visit every battleground state this month.\n\nAccording to Dory MacMillan, the North Carolina communications director for the Biden campaign, the people of North Carolina are aware that President Biden is fighting for their interests. In contrast, Donald Trump is seen as fighting for billionaires, corporations, and an extreme agenda that negatively impacts families and the economy. The Biden campaign is committed to reaching out to every corner of the state to reject Trump\u2019s attacks on families and work towards another four years of progress with President Biden.\n\nThe Biden campaign currently possesses a substantial $155 million fund, and while investment in infrastructure and campaign expenditure is crucial, strategists believe that the governor\u2019s race in North Carolina can significantly contribute to Biden\u2019s success. Notably, the inclusion of far-right Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson on the ballot is expected to play a significant role.\n\nAccording to Michael LaRosa, the traveling press secretary for first lady Jill Biden during the 2020 campaign, the Democratic candidate in North Carolina has a strong advantage this time around. LaRosa believes that the weak Republican gubernatorial candidate, combined with demographic shifts and a well-coordinated campaign, will provide the Biden team with a better opportunity to win the state.\n\nIn the previous election, Trump narrowly defeated Biden in North Carolina with a margin of less than 1 percentage point. The last time a Democrat emerged victorious in a presidential race in the state was when then-Democratic nominee Barack Obama won, but he subsequently lost his bid for re-election to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by a 2 percentage point margin. Trump secured North Carolina\u2019s electoral votes in 2016, when he first ran for the presidency, defeating Hillary Clinton by a comfortable margin of nearly 4 points.\n\nAccording to a collection of polls, Trump currently holds a 7.4 point lead over Biden in North Carolina. This lead is greater than what the former president has achieved in other key swing states.\n\nIn 2024, North Carolina might witness a split-ticket scenario. Although Trump emerged victorious in the state in 2020, Democratic Governor Roy Cooper was reelected for a second term. This suggests a potential outcome where Josh Stein, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, secures a victory while Trump carries North Carolina.\n\nWith the lineup of Republican candidates, Democrats see North Carolina as a promising battleground worth investing their efforts in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wise decision,\u201d remarked Ivan Zapien, a former official at the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Republicans have chosen some down-ballot candidates who are unlikely to fare well in the suburbs, considering the recent performance of suburban areas in past election cycles. The timing is perfect for a potential gain.\u201d\n\nDemocrats admit that they face a challenging task ahead.\n\nAccording to LaRosa, North Carolina is in a prime position to flip in the upcoming election, but it is important to remember that it is still North Carolina.\n\nRepublicans, such as Heye, a North Carolina native, argue that the state is not a foregone conclusion, considering the changes in its demographics.\n\nAccording to the expert, there is a slim possibility that the Democrats could emerge victorious in the state due to its close margin and rapid expansion, particularly in the regions of Charlotte and Raleigh along with their surrounding suburbs.\n\nThe overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court in 2022 led to unexpected results for Democrats, thanks to the increasing presence of young, professional suburban women in growing areas like Charlotte and Raleigh. These women played a significant role in supporting the party and its pro-choice stance.\n\nNorth Carolina is home to 11 historically Black colleges and universities, making it a crucial voting bloc for black voters.\n\nAccording to Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, North Carolina can be compared to Georgia, a state that played a crucial role in securing Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. One of the key factors that contributed to Biden\u2019s success in Georgia was the support he received from Black voters.\n\nAccording to the expert, North Carolina and Georgia are both gaining a significant number of college-educated voters who are crucial for the Democratic Party. Although Georgia has a larger African American voter base, which played a key role in the 2020 election, North Carolina is emerging as a state where Democrats have a strong chance of prevailing.\n\nReference Article",

            "text": "Trump lags behind Biden in campaign cash reserves while legal bills mount\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s campaign continues to boast a significant cash advantage over Donald Trump\u2019s, as the former president juggles the burdens of fundraising for his bid to return to office and paying his mounting legal bills seven months before the general election.\n\nFederal Election Commission reports filed on Wednesday did not offer a full picture of the comparative strength of the two campaigns, because several of the groups raising money for each presumptive nominee will not disclose their latest totals with the FEC until April.\n\nBut the Biden campaign demonstrated a clear fundraising advantage over Trump in filings Wednesday night, reporting $71 million in cash on hand to Trump\u2019s $33.5 million \u2014 more than double his rival\u2019s reserves. Biden\u2019s campaign widened the gap from the end of January, when it led Trump\u2019s campaign $56 million to $30.5 million.\n\nThe reports underscore the extent to which Trump\u2019s legal troubles are putting a strain on his campaign. Save America, the political action committee that the Trump campaign has been using to pay the legal bills for the former president and many of his associates, spent more than it raised in February \u2014 with the vast majority of its spending going to legal costs.\n\nThe Save America PAC reported about $4 million in cash on hand at the end of February. It spent about $7 million over the same period, including $5.6 million paid to lawyers. Since the start of this year, Save America has spent $8.5 million on legal bills, and the Trump campaign has spent $1.8 million on such costs.\n\nTrump has used the charges against him as a rallying cry to galvanize his supporters \u2014 accusing Democrats and President Biden of weaponizing the powers of the Justice Department against him. (Biden has said that he has not suggested to the Justice Department what it should or should not do regarding charges.) Trump has structured his fundraising effort to benefit from his claims. Each time a donor contributes a dollar to the campaign through his joint fundraising committee, 10 cents is directed to Save America and 90 cents is allocated to the Trump presidential campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign brought in nearly $11 million in February and had $33.5 million in cash on hand at the end of the month. Almost all of the money that Trump\u2019s campaign brought in during February came in the form of a transfer from a joint fundraising committee, campaign finance records show. Both Biden and Trump rely on a constellation of committees that together can raise and spend money on behalf of their candidacies.\n\nThough Biden has trailed Trump in many of the early national and battleground state polls, the incumbent\u2019s campaign and allied groups are outpacing Trump\u2019s effort in fundraising and the cash stockpiled for the general election. The disparity is fueled in part by the fact that Biden did not face a contested primary and has been able to raise money in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee, as well as state parties.\n\nThe Biden campaign said that it ended February with $155 million in the bank and that it raised money from nearly half a million donors. The team also said it raised $53 million in February across all of the five entities that are fundraising for the president\u2019s effort, including the DNC. It did not release a breakdown of how much each committee had raised, and some of those reports will not be available until April.\n\nWith flush coffers, the Biden team launched a $30 million spring advertising campaign in key swing states \u2014 including an ad aimed at Latino voters. The campaign has said it will open more than 100 offices this month, and Biden launched a national organizing program to engage Hispanic voters in Arizona this week.\n\nThe Trump campaign just recently joined forces with the Republican National Committee, which has faced its own fundraising strains, and began integrating their fundraising teams and other staff to create greater efficiencies. The campaign negotiated the terms of a joint fundraising agreement with the RNC and state parties across the country, which will help accelerate fundraising for the GOP effort.\n\nAs Trump continues to dominate the GOP landscape in drawing small donors, the RNC\u2019s fundraising has trailed the DNC\u2019s \u2014 though allies of the Trump campaign insist that their fundraising will pick up now that the campaign and the RNC are merging their efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, the RNC reported that it had raised $10.7 million in February and ended the month with $11.3 million in cash on hand. The DNC raised $16.6 million and reported more than double the cash on hand with $26.6 million in the bank at the end of the month.\n\nAfter Trump clinched the nomination earlier this month, his team began a swift revamp of the RNC\u2019s operations as Ronna McDaniel stepped down as the committee\u2019s chair and Michael Whatley took over.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s top advisers, Chris LaCivita, is overseeing the integration of the two operations and addressing dissatisfaction in some sectors of the party about the RNC\u2019s financial situation. Many higher-level aides to the RNC have resigned or been fired in recent weeks and some lower-level staffers were asked to reapply for their jobs.\n\nDespite the upheaval, Whatley said in a memo to RNC members that he was confident that the merging of the two teams would ultimately result in a strong fundraising effort for the GOP. He argued that the recent joint fundraising agreement negotiated by the RNC and the campaign would ensure the party has \u201cthe necessary funds to win up and down the ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur two teams will get President Trump\u2019s vision for America in front of as many people as possible, and we are working on merging our digital assets both from the campaign and RNC,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis merger will greatly expand our capacity and reach.\u201d\n\nDemocrats mocked the fundraising disparity between the two parties on Wednesday. \u201cIf Donald Trump put up these kinds of numbers on The Apprentice, he\u2019d fire himself,\u201d the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, Michael Tyler, said in a statement.\n\nNews Related",

            "text": "rewrite this content and keep HTML tags\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department will file a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\n\n\nThe long-anticipated lawsuit comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach to its hardware and software, in which Apple tightly controls how third-party tech companies can interact with the tech behemoth\u2019s products and services.\n\n\n\nFor example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message.\n\n\n\nThe company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors\u2019 products are far more limited in their capabilities.\n\n\n\nThis year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.\n\n\n\nAnd Apple maintains a large 30 per cent commission on most sales through its app store \u2013 a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple\u2019s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.\n\n\n\nYears of scrutiny\n\n\n\nApple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirrors the precision in which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.\n\n\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s landmark suit is expected to challenge a broad range of Apple\u2019s practices.\n\n\n\nThe case represents the Biden administration\u2019s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under US antitrust law. Apple is the only major tech company the federal government has yet to sue for alleged antitrust violations.\n\n\n\nApple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe legal action could weigh on Apple\u2019s stock price that currently values the company at just under US$3 trillion and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell less than one per cent Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.\n\n\n\nAlong with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.\n\n\n\nThis is a developing story and it will be updated.",

            "text": "\n\n\n\nYesterday, I said Taylor Marshall finally admitted that \"Pope Francis teaches HERESY: Pope Pius XII condemned the heresy of Francis\":\n\nPope Francis on Feb 2 2022, taught, \"that in Christ no one can ever truly separate us from those we love because the bond is an existential bond, a strong bond that is in our very nature...who have denied the faith, who are apostates.\" Pope Pius XII taught the exact opposite when he wrote of those: \"who have not been so unfortunate as to separate themselves from the unity of the Body, or been excluded by legitimate authority for grave faults committed....as does schism or heresy or apostasy.\" Pope Francis is condemned by Pope Pius XII. Only one can be right on this matter. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzxvFNb59Ug]\n\nNow, the question is will he do the Steve Skojec Francis Trad-like semi-modernist thing.\n\nHere is a post that shows what that is like:\n\nSemi-Modernists, FrancisTrads like Skojec, Sedevacantists and Vatican II & I\n\n- This problem is exacerbated by our current historical conditions. As the theological community began to unravel before, during and after Vatican II, those who considered themselves orthodox were those who were obedient and intellectually submissive to the Magisterium, since those who dissented were not orthodox. Therefore the standard of orthodoxy was shifted from Scripture, intrinsic tradition (of which the Magisterium is a part) and extrinsic tradition (which includes magisterial acts of the past, such as Pius IX\u2019s Syllabus of Errors), to a psychological state in which only the current Magisterium is followed.\n\nNeoconservatives have fallen into this way of thinking. The only standard by which they judge - orthodoxy is whether or not one follows the current Magisterium. As a general rule, traditionalists tend to be orthodox in the sense that they are obedient to the current Magisterium, even though they disagree about matters of discipline and have some reservations about certain aspects of current magisterial teachings that seem to contradict the previous Magisterium (e.g., the role of the ecumenical movement). Traditionalists tend to take not just the current Magisterium as their norm but also Scripture, intrinsic tradition, extrinsic tradition and the current Magisterium as the principles of judgment of correct Catholic thinking. This is what distinguishes traditionalists and neoconservatives\n\nInevitably, this magisterialism has led to a form of positivism. Since there are no principles of judgment other than the current Magisterium, whatever the current Magisterium says is always what is \u201corthodox.\u201d In other words, psychologically the neoconservatives have been left in a position in which the extrinsic and intrinsic tradition are no longer included in the norms of judging whether something is orthodox or not. As a result, whatever comes out of the Vatican, regardless of its authoritative weight, is to be held, even if it contradicts what was taught with comparable authority in the past. Since non-infallible ordinary acts of the Magisterium can be erroneous, this leaves one in a precarious situation if one takes as true only what the current Magisterium says. While we are required to give religious assent even to the non-infallible teachings of the Church, what are we to do when a magisterial document contradicts other current or previous teachings and one does not have any more authoritative weight than the other? It is too simplistic merely to say that we are to follow the current teaching. What would happen if in a period of crisis, like our own, a non-infallible ordinary magisterial teaching contradicted what was in fact the truth? If one part of the Magisterium contradicts another, both being at the same level, which is to believed?\n\nUnfortunately, what has happened is that many neoconservatives have acted as if non-infallible ordinary magisterial teachings (such as, for instance, the role of inculturation in the liturgy as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church) are, in fact, infallible when the current Magisterium promulgates them. This is a positivist mentality. Many of the things that neoconservatives do are the result of implicitly adopting principles that they have not fully or explicitly considered. Many of them would deny this characterization because they do not intellectually hold to what, in fact, are their operative principles. - Fr. Chad Ripperger, F.S.S.P. [http://www.latinmassmagazine.com/articles/articles_2001_sp_ripperger.html]\n\n\n\n- \"Some... assembled [Council] prelates advocated... harsh measures towards the [Semi-Arian] Arianizers... Athanasius, however, proposed more temperate measures... A decree was passed, that such [Semi-Arian] bishops as had communicated with the Arians through weakness or surprise, should be recognized in their respective sees, on signing the Nicene formulary; but that those, who publicly defended the heresy, should only be admitted to lay-communion... Yet it cannot be denied, that men of zeal and boldness were found among the [Semi-Arian] Arianizers. Two laymen, Flavian and Diodorus, protested with spirit against the [unambiguous Arian] heterodoxy of the crafty Leontius, and kept alive an orthodox [Catholic] party in the midst of the [Arian] Eusebian communion.\"\n\n(The Arians of the Fourth Century, By John Henry Newman, Pages 198-199)\n\n\n\n'Yet the men were better than their creed; and it is satisfactory to be able to detect amid the impiety and worldliness of the heretical party any elements of a purer spirit, which gradually exerted itself and worked out from the corrupt mass, in which it was embedded. Even thus viewed as distinct from their political associates, the Semi-Arians are a motley party at best; yet they may be considered as Saints and Martyrs, when compared with the Eusebians, and in fact some of them have actually been acknowledged as such by the Catholics of subsequent times. Their zeal in detecting the humanitarianism of Marcellus and Photinus, and their good service in withstanding the {300} Anom\u0153ans, who arrived at the same humanitarianism by a bolder course of thought, will presently be mentioned. On the whole they were men of correct and exemplary life, and earnest according to their views; and they even made pretensions to sanctity in their outward deportment, in which they differed from the true Eusebians, who, as far as the times allowed it, affected the manners and principles of the world. It may be added, that both Athanasius and Hilary, two of the most uncompromising supporters of the Catholic doctrine, speak favourably of them. Athanasius does not hesitate to call them brothers [Note 7]; considering that, however necessary it was for the edification of the Church at large, that the Homo\u00fcsion should be enforced on the clergy, yet that the privileges of private Christian fellowship were not to be denied to those, who from one cause or other stumbled at the use of it [Note 8]. It is remarkable, that the Semi-Arians, on the contrary, in their most celebrated Synod (at Ancyra, A.D. 358) anathematized the holders of the Homo\u00fcsion, as if crypto-Sabellians [Note 9].\"\n\n[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/arians/chapter4-2.html]\n\n- Cardinal John Henry Newman\n\n\n\nWhat is a Semi-Modernist and could Fr. Thomas Weinandy be a Semi-Modernist in recently promoting the Francis agenda?\n\nWhy were the conservative Vatican II popes and why are almost all the conservative present day bishops and conservative Catholics so afraid of a schism with the Modernist heretic faction?\n\n\n\nMight it be because like in the Arian crisis when there were Arians and Semi-Arians so today there are Semi-Modernists who because of \"weakness\" don't want schism and want communion with the total Modernist heretics?\n\n\n\nRemember what Cardinal Newman said:\n\n\n\n\"Athanasius, however, proposed more temperate measures... A decree was passed, that such [Semi-Arian] bishops as had communicated with the Arians through weakness or surprise, should be recognized in their respective sees, on signing the Nicene formulary; but that those, who publicly defended the heresy, should only be admitted to lay-communion.\"\n\n\n\nSemi-Arians were those who attempted the practically almost impossible task of being loyal to the traditional teachings of the Church while holding on to Semi-Arian ambiguous teachings because they were afraid of being in schism with the total Arian heretics who were supported and protected by the Roman government.\n\n\n\nSo today, it appears that most conservative Catholics like the Semi-Arians have tried to do the practically almost impossible task of being loyal to the infallible teachings of the Church while holding on to Semi-Modernist ambiguous teachings as well as the ambiguities of Vatican II because they are afraid of being in schism with the Modernist heretics.\n\n\n\nNewman said that during the Arian Heresy Crisis 80% of the bishops were Arians or semi-Arains which is probably similar to the number of bishops who today have fallen into Modernism or Semi-Modernism.\n\n\n\nFrancis's closest adviser and collaborator Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga apparently declared himself, Francis and all liberals to be total Modernist heretics since Vatican II:\n\n\n\n\"The Second Vatican Council... meant an end to the hostilities between the Church and Modernism... Modernism was, most of the time, a reaction against injustices and abuses that disparaged the dignity and rights of the person.\"\n\n(Whispers in the Loggia Website, \"The Council's 'Unfinished Business,' The Church's 'Return to Jesus\"... and Dreams of \"The Next Pope\" - A Southern Weekend with Francis' 'Discovery Channel,'\" October 28, 2013)\n\n\n\nThe journalist conservative Catholic Milo Yiannopoulos in his book \"Diabolical\" reported:\n\n\n\n\"Since Vatican II, most popes have been preoccupied with holding together the conservative [Semi-Modernist] and liberal [Modernist heretic] factions that emerged in its wake.\"\n\nAgain, I say during the Arian crisis, Semi-Arians were those who attempted the practically almost impossible task of being loyal to the traditional teachings of the Church while holding on to Semi-Arian ambiguous teachings because they were afraid of being in schism with the total Arian heretics.\n\n\n\nSo today, it appears that most conservative Catholics like the Semi-Arians have tried to do the practically almost impossible task of being loyal to the infallible teachings of the Church while holding on to Semi-Modernist ambiguous teachings as well as the ambiguities of Vatican II because they are afraid of being in schism with the Modernist heretics.\n\nMight it be because like in the Arian crisis when there were Arians and Semi-Arians so today there are Semi-Modernists who because of \"weakness\" don't want schism and want communion with the total Modernist heretics?\n\n\n\nIf Francis is a Modernist then, might the conservative Fr. Thomas Weinandy possibly hold Semi-Modernist and Semi-Arian opinions?\n\nThis Project MUSE theological article seems to present the case that Weinandy might possibly hold Semi-Arian poistions:\n\nThis article responds to Thomas Weinandy's account of the consciousness and knowledge of Christ. Deserving of careful consideration, his is a rich and multifaceted proposal on a difficult and complex topic. Some of the complexity is theological in nature, not all of which I will be able to avoid in my response. Still, this response is meant to be primarily philosophical in nature. And it appears that there are two kinds of philosophical presuppositions that typically go unacknowledged in discussions of this topic. One concerns theories of personhood and self-consciousness. The other has to do with the \"principle of perfection,\" a \"principle of fittingness\"\u2014or what Thomas Weinandy calls \"the false presupposition\" of Thomas Aquinas's Christology. To my mind, both are philosophical presuppositions, but the first (on personhood and self-consciousness) fits the theme of this volume more closely, and so it will be the topic of this response.\n\nPerson versus I\u2014The Trinity\n\nWeinandy's proposal regarding the human consciousness of Christ seems peculiar if not unique in that it suggests that in Christ there is no divine I, but only a human I. In fact, in this proposal none of the divine persons has an I\u2014though I am not sure the suggestion is that they share a common [End Page 425] I.2 Thus Christ would be a divine person without a divine I. The personal pronoun I would be connected with a human nature as self-conscious, rather than with the divine person in which this nature subsists.\n\n[... ]\n\n\n\nI do not currently see any philosophical objections to this suggestion regarding the Trinity. But neither do I see what would force us to make this assumption. By contrast, Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, for example, would hold that there are three intelligent and free subjects in God.4 And [End Page 426] indeed, though the three persons are distinct from each other, each is not \"really\" distinct from the divine essence, and we would therefore expect each person to have all the properties that the essence has. The persons are distinct only by their proper relationality with each other. And this relationality consists in the way in which each person passes on the whole and entire essence to the other.5 Thus the Son has the whole essence as received from the Father; he has the essence in a filial way. He has the divine will in a filial manner, and the divine mind as \"conceived\" or in the form of a concept, word, or logos. If therefore self-consciousness is a property of the divine essence\u2014for God is Spirit\u2014and if persons are beings that have a nature or essence, then each of the divine persons has this one divine essence and the property of self.\" [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/735101]\n\nIt appears that the Sedevacantist friendly website, aka Catholic, may be making a big deal for their cause about the apparent Semi-Modernist and possible Arian Fr. Weinandy jumping on board with Francis's \"Synodal Path to a Synodal Church\":\n\nBased on his 2017 letter to Jorge, it appeared that he had at least some semblance of Catholic faith coursing through his veins. Did someone spike the Capuchin\u2019s cappuccino? Was he blackmailed? Did Jorge\u2019s operatives threaten to shoot his puppy?\n\nWhile any and all of these things are possible given the level of evil presently dwelling in occupied Rome, the real answer is far more obvious:\n\n\n\nWeinandy is just another man of the Council. As such, whenever or wherever his words or deeds give the appearance of orthodoxy, it is just this, mere appearance. In reality, he, like the rest of his conciliar con freres, is tainted with more than a little leaven of error. They belong to a counterfeit church. As the Baltimore Catechism states:\n\n\u201cIf any Catholic denies only one article of faith, though he believes all the rest, he ceases to be a Catholic, and is cut off from the Church\u201d (see Q. 129, 1945 edition, p. 142).\n\nConsider Weinandy\u2019s passionate praise for the Almighty Council and its abundant fruit published just last year:\n\n\u2013 \u201cWithout Vatican II, it would be hard to imagine Karol Wojtyla being elected Pope.\u201d [https://akacatholic.com/what-happened-to-stompin-tom-weinandy/]\n\nBefore we move to the next point that Sedevacantists and Francis Traditionalists like Steve Skojec are in agreement that Francis and Benedict as well as John Paul II are the same, let's look at the problems with Sedevacantism.\n\nNumber one is Vatican I.\n\nAre they prepared to deny Vatican I?\n\n\n\nVatican I clearly teaches that popes will reign perpetually:\n\n\n\n\"[T]he true doctrine concerning the establishment, the perpetuity, and the nature of the apostolic primacy. In this primacy, all the efficacy and all the strength of the Church are placed. (Vatican I, Pastor Aeternus, chapter 1)\" (UnamSanctumCatholicm.com, \"False Principles of Sedevantism (Part 1)).\n\nBr. Alexis Bugnolo explains some other problems with them:\n\n\n\nSedevacantists hold in general that there have been no true popes since Pius XII. They accept the error of Luther that there is no authority or unity in the Church except that which is given the individual by the virtue of Faith. Thus, holding themselves as purer than all others, after the manner of Jansenists, they judge nearly everyone a heretic and thus outside of the Church. Their special target is all who hold an office which comes down through Apostolic Succession, because that is the real threat to their error and their egos.\" [https://fromrome.info/2020/01/19/flagship-of-sedes-presages-ppbxvi-movement-victory-in-2020/]\n\nGetting back to the Sedevacantist and Francis Traditionalists like Skojec thinking Francis and Benedict as well as John Paul II are the same.\n\n\n\nThe Remnant and Skojec are right in saying that the Vatican II's ambiguities which were a forerunner of Amoris Laetitia's ambiguity lead to the problems within the Church and outside including false ecumenism.\n\n\n\nStrangely, the non-traditionalist conservative Matthew Schmitz put it best:\n\n\n\n\"[T]he post-Vatican II settlement [of]... Upholding Catholic teaching on paper but not in reality as led to widespread corruption... a culture of lies... that allowed men like McCarrick to flourish.\"\n\n\n\nIt allowed the Church of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI to keep heretics and homosexual predators in the hierarchy such as McCarrick and others like him to flourish and to promote neo-sacrilegious media productions such as the Assisi fiasco and the kissing of the Koran.\n\n\n\nThis was wrong and God will judge them for their failures to be good fathers (popes) in allowing evil men into God's Church to abuse and to lead many to indifferentism and away from salvation which is only in Jesus through His Church.\n\n\n\nBoth sincerely in my opinion because of false philosophical personal ideas while not totally abandoning Thomism tried to do the practically almost impossible task of being loyal to the infallible teachings of the Church while holding on to neo-modernist Personalist versions of Kantian and Hegelian philosophy as well as the ambiguities of Vatican II.\n\n\n\nBenedict if you read his later writings finally rejected Kantianism, but apparently couldn't completely give up Hegelianism.\n\n\n\nHowever, he realized in a vague way that the ambiguity of Vatican II was destroying the Church so he brought back the Traditional Latin Mass and attempted to fight against sex abuse, the Vatican gay lobby and reform the finances to the Church.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, these efforts united the financially corrupt old guard of Cardinal Angelo Sodano and the Vatican gay lobby which brought about Vatileaks and other pressures against Benedict that eventually lead to the Benedict resignation and the papacy of Jorge Bergoglio whose pontifical validity has been questioned by many even in the hierarchy from the beginning to this day.\n\n\n\nAs Bishop Ren\u00e9 Gracida has said there was never universal acceptance of Bergoglio by the Church.\n\n\n\nBut even more importantly, there are reasonable doubts about the validity of Benedict's resignation and Bergoglio's lawful election to the papacy which were never present with the other papacies which Bishop Gracida declares must be investigated and interpreted by the cardinals as John Paul's conclave constitution explicitly states.\n\n\n\nThis is one reason that Francis is not the same as Benedict and John Paul.\n\n\n\nThe other reason that The Remnant and Skojec are wrong about saying Francis is the same as Benedict and John Paul can be put simply in analogy:\n\n\n\nJohn Paul and Benedict were sincere doctors with medicine that was getting the patient sicker.\n\n\n\nBenedict realized the medicine was bad and slowly started giving good medicine.\n\n\n\nBut in my opinion, Francis is a doctor who is trying to kill the patient by slow poisoning.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, it is obvious that Francis doesn't have even a remnant of Thomism. Nor does he apparently care about being loyal to the infallible Church teachings. He appears to be a nihilistic postmodernist like his favorite theologian Michel de Certeau.\n\n\n\nFrancis's only grasp of reality or meaning appears to be leftist and Peronist ideology as well as his close friend the kissing bishop's Bernard Haring Hegelian situation ethics all dressed in religious language.\n\n\n\nWhile Benedict and John Paul upheld Church teachings on paper while not always in reality, Francis with Amoris Laetitia, the Argentine letter, the death penalty Catechism change and the latest indifferentism papal statement isn't even upholding the infallible teachings on paper.\n\n\n\nGeorge Gilder wrote a book called \"Sexual Suicide\" which helped me return to the Church because it showed that the Catholic teachings on sexuality were true and those outside those teachings were committing slow suicide.\n\n\n\nFrancis in my opinion is trying to kill the Church by slow suicide.\n\n\n\nHe will not succeed because Jesus promised the gates of Hell will not prevail.\n\n\n\nThose who don't oppose him in my opinion are his accomplices unless they are in invincible ignorance.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, it appears that if Francis doesn't convert he may be heading down a path of destruction along with all his accomplices if they don't convert if they aren't in invincible ignorance.\n\n\n\nI feel sorry for them.\n\n\n\nWe must pray for him and his accomplices, but most of all we must pray for all those abused and lead away from salvation by their promotion of heresy.\n\nPray an Our Father now for reparation for the sins committed because of Francis\u2019s Amoris Laetitia.\n\nPray an Our Father now for the restoration of the Church as well as the Triumph of the Kingdom of the Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nStop for a moment of silence, ask Jesus Christ what He wants you to do now and next. In this silence remember God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost \u2013 Three Divine Persons yet One God, has an ordered universe where you can know truth and falsehood as well as never forget that He wants you to have eternal happiness with Him as his son or daughter by grace.

The final tally was 390-9. All nine \u201cno\u201d votes were by Republicans.\n\nSponsored by Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Susan Wild, HR 149, \u201cCondemning the illegal abduction of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation,\u201d had been introduced in February of 2023 and made its way to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where it sat for nearly nine months before being passed unanimously and sent to the full House for a vote. It is symbolic and does not order any funds or any actions.\n\nThe resolution gives a timeline of Russia\u2019s actions, including stating that \u201cRussian Forces attacked a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of 3 individuals and injuries to 17 other individuals,\u201d in March of 2022.\n\nREAD MORE: McConnell Rips Johnson Again Over Ukraine\n\nAlso in that month, it notes, \u201cthe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced that the Russian military had forcefully and illegally kidnapped 2,389 Ukrainian children from temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine.\u201d It adds that \u201con June 2, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that 200,000 children are among the Ukrainians who have been forcefully resettled in Russia,\u201d and states that \u201cforcibly transferring children of one group to another group is a violation of Article II(e) of the Genocide Convention,\u201d of which Russia is a signatory.\n\nThe resolution states that \u201cMaria Lvova-Belova, Children\u2019s Rights Commissioner for the President of Russia, admitted to kidnapping Ukrainian children and facilitating forced adoptions to Russian families.\u201d\n\nHorrifically, it adds, \u201con June 22, 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner has verified at that at least 320 children have been killed since Russia\u2019s renewed invasion began,\u201d and, \u201con June 16, 2022, Russian authorities announced that children born in occupied Ukrainian territories after the February 24, 2022, invasion will be deemed Russian citizens.\u201d\n\nThe resolution then states that the U.S. House of Representatives \u201cholds the Government of the Russian Federation, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, responsible for the wrongful and illegal kidnapping of children from Ukraine and officially condemns these actions in the strongest terms.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Ramaswamy Eyed for Homeland Security Head if Trump Re-Elected: Report\n\nIt also states the House \u201cclaims that the Russian Federation is attempting to wipe out a generation of Ukrainian children, thereby crippling Ukraine\u2019s ability to nurture the next generation of Ukrainian citizens and leaders and to rebuild their country after Russia\u2019s unprovoked war, with the purpose of demolishing Ukraine\u2019s unique language, culture, history, and identity.\u201d\n\nThe nine House Republicans who voted no are:\n\nAndy Biggs (AZ), Eric Burlison (MO), Warren Davidson (OH), Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA), Clay Higgins (LA), Thomas Massie (KY), Matt Rosendale (MT), Chip Roy (TX) and Tom Tiffany (WI).\n\n(Links in bold above lead to NCRM\u2019s coverage of those specific lawmakers.)\n\nAll but two, Greene and Massie, are believed to be members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus.

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe White House defended its response to the asylum seeker influx facing New York Friday, arguing that without congressional action, the administration is limited in what it can do, following a letter from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul urging more action.\n\nThe growing number of migrants at the US-Mexico border has posed a steep challenge for the Biden administration. It\u2019s a delicate issue for a White House dogged by fierce criticism from the left and right over its handling of the US southern border and remains a political vulnerability amid Republican attacks as the 2024 presidential election approaches and Democratic local officials face pressures at home.\n\nHochul\u2019s announcement this week is the latest salvo in the ongoing migrant saga that has bedeviled local and state officials struggling to navigate the crisis that they have said needs a more robust federal response. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019ve managed thus far without substantive support from Washington,\u201d Hochul said in an address from Albany Thursday.\n\nIn a letter to the White House, Hochul urged Biden to take executive action to expedite work authorizations for asylum seekers, provide more financial aid to the city and the state and make more federal land available to house migrants, among other asks.\n\nIn what may have been her most direct call for assistance, Hochul said she and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have been sounding the alarm for expedited work authorization for migrants and additional federal funds to manage the crisis since July 2022.\n\n\u201cIn our first meeting with the President, Mayor Adams and I have championed the idea of a federal designation that would allow the individuals already here in New York, the ability to work to support themselves and their families,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cThe mayor and I said that and in countless meetings with Congress, the White House, Cabinet members and rallies with labor, press conferences and working with business. What we\u2019ve said all along is just let them work and help us out financially.\u201d\n\nNew York City has been the recipient of millions of dollars in federal funding to address the growing number of migrant arrivals. The administration also expects over $100 million of that support to be made available in the coming weeks.\n\nThe process for applying for asylum and a work permit is based on current immigration laws \u2013 and in recent years, has been made more difficult because of an immense backlog. Immigrant advocates argue that the Biden administration should expand the number of Venezuelans \u2013 who make up many of the migrant arrivals in New York \u2013 eligible for a form of humanitarian-relief known as Temporary Protected Status. That, they say, is perhaps the easiest form of action, without congressional action, the administration could take to satisfy the ask from New York. The Department of Homeland Security secretary has discretion to designate a country for TPS.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson said: \u201cWithout Congressional action, this Administration has been working to build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system and has worked to identify ways to improve efficiencies and maximize the resources the federal government can provide to communities across the country to support the flow of migrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to partner with communities across the country to ensure they can receive the support they need. Only Congress can provide additional funding for these efforts, which this Administration has already requested, and only Congress can fix the broken immigration system,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nTom Perez, the director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, recently spent time in New York to try to smooth over tensions over the migrant crisis and coordinate with state and city partners, according to multiple sources. And DHS dispatched an assessment team to work with state and local officials, according to an administration official.\n\nTensions rise in New York\n\nThe situation has also caused a divide between Hochul and the Adams\u2019 administrations, with the mayor having previously asked for asylum seekers to be sent to other municipalities throughout the state, not just stay in New York City.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019re disappointed that the state today appears to minimize the role that they can \u2013 and must \u2013 play in responding to this crisis, the state must fulfil its duty to more than 8 million of the state\u2019s residents who call New York City home,\u201d Adams said in a press release Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWhatever differences we all may have about how to handle this crisis; we believe what is crystal clear is that whatever obligations apply under state law to the City of New York apply with equal force to every county across New York state. Leaving New York City alone to manage this crisis \u2013 and abdicating the state\u2019s responsibility to coordinate a statewide response \u2013 is unfair to New York City residents who also didn\u2019t ask to be left almost entirely on their own in the middle of a national crisis.\u201d\n\nHochul, meanwhile, has been steadfast in saying she would not use her executive powers to force other counties to take in asylum seekers, citing the city\u2019s right-to-shelter law, which has been the backdrop of an ongoing legal back-and-forth between the city and the state.\n\n\u201cThis is an agreement that does not apply to the state\u2019s other 57 counties, which is one of the reasons we cannot and will not force other parts of our state to shelter migrants,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cNor are we going to be asking migrants to move to other parts of the state against their will.\u201d\n\nShe said that the state is working with the Department of Labor to connect migrants with jobs once the federal government approves their work authorizations. There have been 2600 families that have applied for asylum over the past 7 weeks, according to New York State Homeland Security Commissioner Jackie Bray. In a survey from this past May, 10% of people being sheltered have previously applied for asylum, Bray said.\n\nHochul said the plan, which hinges on asylum seekers being allowed to work, would help the migrant crisis, as well as businesses, which have struggled to find people to work.\n\n\u201cThis is a national and a federal issue, but New York has shouldered this burden for far too long,\u201d Hochul said.",

Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don\u2019t show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won\u2019t be made until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dumpster fire\u2019 \u2013\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers\u2019 bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump\u2019s Save America political action committee \u2014 money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters \u2014 and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\u201d a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E.

Photograph: Brendan Smialowskikamil Krzaczynski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump told his vice-president, Mike Pence, that refusing to block certification of Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 election victory at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 would be \u201ca political career killer\u201d, according to newly released testimony from a presidential valet.\n\n\u201cMike, this is a political career killer if you do this,\u201d Trump told Pence by phone on the morning of January 6, the New York Times reported, citing a transcript of testimony to the House committee that investigated the deadly attack on Congress that unfolded later that day.\n\nRelated: Mike Pence will not endorse Trump, but will not rule out voting for him\n\nAccording to the Times, the unnamed valet also said Trump appeared unconcerned when he was told a civilian had been shot dead as the Capitol was stormed.\n\n\u201cI just remember seeing it in front of him,\u201d the valet said of a card given to Trump as he watched the riot on television. \u201cI don\u2019t remember how it got there or whatever. But there was no, like, reaction.\u201d\n\nThe woman who was killed, Ashli Babbitt, has become a martyr to the Trumpist far right. Trump has called her a \u201cgreat patriot\u201d. The police officer who shot her outside the House chamber was cleared of wrongdoing, a judgment with which Trump disagreed.\n\nEight other deaths, including law enforcement suicides, are now linked to the Capitol attack, which happened after Trump told supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to overturn Biden\u2019s win, which according to Trump\u2019s lie was the result of electoral fraud.\n\nMore than 1,200 arrests have been made over the riot and hundreds of convictions and sentences secured. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted by Senate Republicans. He is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president, despite facing 88 criminal charges (14 concerning election subversion) and multimillion-dollar penalties in civil lawsuits. The US supreme court rejected attempts to keep Trump off the ballot under the 14th amendment to the constitution, which bars insurrectionists from office.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Times said it obtained the redacted transcript of the valet\u2019s testimony from House Republicans who claim the January 6 committee omitted from its hearings and report anything that did not suit its narrative.\n\nTranscripts contradicting sensational testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a close aide to Trump\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, have already been released.\n\nBarry Loudermilk of Georgia, the Republican leading the effort to undermine the work of the January 6 committee, told the Times there was \u201csome testimony in [the valet transcript] that may not be favorable to Trump\u201d but said: \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all out there, not doing what the select committee did, and putting things out there that will be favorable to our side.\u201d\n\nBennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chaired the January 6 committee, which included two anti-Trump Republicans, told the Times: \u201cDespite Mr Loudermilk\u2019s attempts to rewrite the violent history of January 6, the facts laid out in the select committee\u2019s final report remain undisputed \u2013 and nothing substantive was left out nor hidden.\n\n\u201cWhile the valet did not witness everything that happened in the White House that day, the testimony confirms Trump\u2019s indifference to the violence and his anger at Vice-President Pence for performing his duty under the constitution.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed valet said he did not remember Trump calling Pence what the Times called \u201can expletive meant to refer to a wimp\u201d, otherwise widely reported to have been the word \u201cpussy\u201d.\n\nAs the Times noted, Trump has not disputed the insult that was described to the January 6 committee by a former chief of staff to Ivanka Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe valet also said he did not remember Trump or any staff member commenting on how rioters chanted for Pence to be hanged. Hutchinson told the committee she heard aides saying Trump said Pence \u201cdeserved\u201d such a fate.\n\nThe valet said he heard Trump ask aides about how to send national guard troops to the Capitol, a deployment that took several hours as chaos reigned and a contentious issue since.\n\nThe valet also described \u201cdisbelief\u201d among White House staff as the situation at the Capitol worsened and Trump persisted in watching TV.\n\nPence escaped the rioters and ultimately returned to the Capitol to preside over certification, despite objections from 147 Republicans in the House and Senate. According to Trump\u2019s valet, the president \u201cjust mentioned that Mike let him down, and that was it\u201d.\n\nTrump has been proved right, however, about Pence committing a \u201cpolitical career killer\u201d. Portrayed as a hero by the January 6 committee, Pence ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Failing to make an impact, he withdrew well before the first primary vote.\n\nLast week, he exacted a measure of revenge \u2013 by refusing to endorse Trump in his rematch with Biden.\n\nBut Pence also said his differences with Trump were \u201cnot personal\u201d \u2013 and refused to say he would not vote for him.",

            "text": "Biden Campaign Distances Itself From Mysterious Big Dem Donor 'Chairman G'\n\nAuthored by Soobin Kim and Bradley Hope via whalehunting.projectbrazen.com,\n\nLast fall, we reported on a man named Gaurav Srivastava who pretended to be a CIA operative to allegedly fleece the sanctioned Dutch oil trader Niels Troost. The ruse was simple, according to extensive recorded conversations: hand over half your company to me, a secret spy, and I'll protect you from the US government because ... I'm a secret spy.\n\nIn the following months since our original article, it emerged that Srivastava \u2013 or \"Chairman G,\" as he likes to be called \u2013 is a big time political donor in the United States.\n\nWhale Hunting can exclusively reveal that FBI agents in Los Angeles have been interviewing Srivastava\u2019s current and former associates about his campaign donations, claims of being a federal officer and other financial affairs.\n\nWe also confirmed from a staff member for the Washington State Democratic Party that the Biden campaign is in the process of quietly refunding thousands of dollars of his political donations.\n\nThe FBI inquiries \u2014 ongoing for last several months \u2014 may lead nowhere, but the Biden campaign\u2019s decision to start refunding donations suggests there are deeper issues afoot for Srivastava.\n\n\u201cAll allegations raised in this story are false,\" a spokesman for Srivastava told us (full statement and more details on the news after the jump).\n\nThe culmination of Srivastava\u2019s rise to public life came alongside a more than $1 million donation in 2022 to the Atlantic Council, a DC-based think tank. The money underwrote a conference in Bali, where he was a \u201cco-host\u201d and rubbed shoulders with business magnates, political honchos and John Legend.\n\nBut that relationship isn\u2019t going smoothly. The Atlantic Council terminated its relationship with Srivastava, Politico reported last month, and returned additional funds donated by Srivastava in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision to terminate our relationship with Mr. Srivastava in May 2023 upon learning new information because of our donor review process. For example, we learned that The Gaurav & Sharon Srivastava Family Foundation was not an established 501C3 in April of 2023, despite Mr. Srivastava\u2019s representation to the Council that this was a registered foundation,\u201d the spokesperson told Politico.\n\nSrivastava\u2019s lawyer told Politico the Atlantic Council made the decision after they \u201cdisagreed\u201d about how a gift would be implemented. (Small note: Recipients of gifts usually try very hard to implement the handover of gifts.)\n\nAlongside his campaign to solve global food security he also became a big spender on political campaigns. Among Srivastava\u2019s key advisors for how to best disperse funds for political purposes were Greg Schultz (Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign manager) and Ret. General Wesley Clark. They didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission\u2019s database of individual contributions shows that Srivastava contributed at least $1 million to political campaigns and committees in the United States. As an Indian national he is eligible to donate to political campaigns as a Green Card holder. Lo and behold, the donations led to a photo op with Biden which you can find here.\n\nSince 2022, Srivastava has made sizeable donations \u2013 including over $500,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and $500,000 to Senate Majority PAC.\n\nOne mystery we are continuing to investigate: Whale Hunting discovered publicly available evidence suggesting Srivastava contributed over $116,000 using the personal details of an individual with the same name who resides in the same city. The funds were donated under the previous employer, occupation and mailing address of the namesake, who denies making the donations.\n\nIt's unclear how those donations were made. Impersonating another individual to make a political contribution is strictly prohibited by law.\n\nThe single biggest recipient for the donations made with the namesake's personal details was the Biden Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 re-election, which received $50,000. About a dozen state Democratic parties across the U.S. also received funds through the Biden Victory Fund.\n\n\"The Biden campaign is aware of the issue and the donation is in the process of being refunded,\" a staff member with Washington State Democratic Party, which received these funds, told Whale Hunting in an email.\n\nIt's unclear the exact allegations the FBI is investigating, but among the questions they've presented current and former associates of Srivastava have been queries about his political spending, source of funds, involvement in international money transfers and other topics related to the allegations already aired publicly about Srivastava in a litany of lawsuits.\n\nSrivastava's spokesman's full comment here:\n\nAll allegations raised in this story are false. The source for this story and others, including 87 paid stories on obscure websites, is tied to a Russian asset facilitating the unfettered trade of Russian oil as made clear by the U.K. sanctions. There\u2019s a direct through-line between Russia, a barrel of oil and the high price of gas at the pump squeezing the American consumer. The slanderous suggestion of a fabricated relationship between Mr. Srivastava and a U.S. intelligence agency was orchestrated by the same Russian asset relied on as a source for your stories and designed by that Russian asset to put a target on his back, threatening the safety of him, his friends and family.\n\nSo if your year is off to a bad start, think about what Srivastava is now dealing with: being on the Feds\u2019 radar, juggling a glut of lawsuits brought on by all the people he\u2019s allegedly stiffed \u2013 from his former interior designer to former landlord to former business partners \u2013 and witnessing the collapse of his carefully crafted reputation.\n\nIn the meantime, Whale Hunting will be chasing this story to fill its gaping plot holes, one among them being where on earth Chairman G got the funds to make the donations in the first place. If you have any insight, please get in touch!",

What makes us think, even if the administration is 100% correct on the policy, what makes them think that in the midst of an election campaign, in the midst of a so-called peace talk, that we can publicly vilify a nation, persons, and think that a leader is going to say, now I will yield before the world and God, because I\u2019ve been told? What in the hell do we think we\u2019re doing?\u201d\n\nBiden noted, \u201cWhy, why is there any incentive for the Arabs to make any compromise, any compromise, in the peace talks? Why, if they know that they must only wait for the United States to do their bargaining for them? Why would they compromise? Why would they be reasonable?\u201d\n\nInterestingly, James Baker was serving as secretary of state at the time. Baker is infamous for his comment \u201cF\u2014 the Jews, they don\u2019t vote for us anyway.\u201d Baker\u2019s comments proved a self-fulfilling prophecy. His boss, President George H.W. Bush, went from 35% of the Jewish vote in 1988 to 12% in the 1992 election, which he lost to Bill Clinton.\n\nBaker wasn\u2019t the first to make such a miscalculation. President Jimmy Carter\u2019s Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan warned Carter that his policies towards Israel would alienate American Jews. Carter ignored him and went from 71% of the Jewish vote in 1976 to 45% in the 1980 election he lost to Ronald Reagan.\n\nToday, President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer appear to have adopted the same failed strategy, except to them, the watchword is, in effect: F\u2014 the Jews, they\u2019ll vote for us anyway. But just as Baker and Carter were wrong to discount the Jewish vote, those who do so now to justify policies hostile to Israel do so at their own peril.\n\nBy strange coincidence, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman is again playing a major role in all this. Back in the early \u201890s, Friedman played tennis with Baker and served as the press mouthpiece for Baker\u2019s policy of blaming Israel for the lack of Middle East peace. At the time, Baker and Bush were pressuring then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to forgo his insistence on bilateral negotiations. They did so by threatening to withhold U.S. loan guarantees intended to assist Israel in absorbing a million olim from the Soviet Union.\n\nToday, Friedman is once again a mouthpiece, this time for the Biden administration\u2019s policy of attacking Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over Israel\u2019s defensive war against Hamas. Rather than insist on Hamas surrendering and releasing all the hostages\u2014including the American ones\u2014which would end the war immediately, the administration is more interested in pandering to a few thousand Muslim voters in swing states who hate Israel and often support Hamas. This is an offensive and self-destructive policy.\n\nThere are already strong signs that, as a result of his misguided approach, Biden is hemorrhaging Jewish support. A Sienna poll of New York voters found former President Donald Trump winning the Jewish vote by a wide margin. This is in keeping with the results of the 2020 election, which saw Trump\u2019s share of Florida\u2019s Jewish voters rise from 23% in 2016 to 41%.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of American Jews and Americans in general support Israel and disdain Hamas. The exponential rise in antisemitic incidents and failure of Biden\u2019s vaunted plan to combat antisemitism, as well as his failure even to mention the problem in his State of the Union address are also leading many Jews to drop their support for Biden.\n\nIn 1992, Friedman and Baker inadvertently undermined Jewish support for the Republican Party. Friedman and Biden are now doing the same to the Democrats. History demonstrates that sitting presidents who turn on Israel always end up in failure and defeat.",

            "text": "President Joe Biden is taking his reelection pitch to a pair of Western battleground states this week, heading to Nevada and Arizona to shore up support in key states he\u2019s looking to defend against former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nBiden\u2019s pitch will zero-in on efforts toimprove the cost of housing and create jobs in clean energy and manufacturing as he makes the case to Americans that his policies are working for them. He\u2019ll also use the trip to highlight early organizing efforts in these two states that the campaign believes will be \u201ccore\u201d to electoral victory.\n\nThe president is also looking to appeal to Latinos, who make up a sizable portion of voters in Arizona and Nevada, as his predecessor has sought to make inroads in a community that has long been key to the Democratic coalition. Biden launched the campaign\u2019s \u201cLatinos con Biden-Harris\u201d organizing initiative during a visit to South Phoenix, Arizona, on Tuesday evening.\n\nWhile the president bested former President Donald Trump in both Nevada and Arizona in 2020, early polling indicates his path to victory in these Western swing states may be a challenge this year. Nevada is expected to be a tight race, and in Arizona, a Fox News poll of the state reflected a slight edge for Trump over Biden, who has also been hampered by low approval ratings nationwide.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s team hopes a number of issues \u2013 including reproductive rights and democracy arguments \u2013 could work in their favor against Trump, especially with moderate voters.\n\nArizona and Nevada could see abortion rights provisions on their state ballots this November, which the campaign believes will be key to its organizing and can galvanize women and moderate voters.\n\n\u201cNevadans and Arizonans are gathering signatures for ballot initiative to give voters the opportunity to protect abortion access in their states\u2019 constitution in 2024. Nevada is one of the most pro-choice states in the nation. And the vast majority of Arizonans support abortion access, as well,\u201d said Dan Kanninen, the Biden campaign\u2019s battleground states director.\n\nAlong with issues like job creation and protection for unions, the campaign also plans to make the battle for democracy a key plank of its argument in these states.\n\n\u201cIssues of democracy are particularly potent and top of mind in both states. Trump\u2019s allies in Arizona launched their infamous election audits after his loss in 2020. The state Republican Party in Nevada is literally run by Trump\u2019s indicted fake electors. Democrats, independents, and moderate Republicans have come together to defeat the far-right candidates in these states who have parried Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Kanninen said.\n\nVictory in both states will require activating Biden\u2019s 2020 coalition and mobilizing new voters. The campaign is looking to both states\u2019 diverse voters, including AAPI, Latino, Black, indigenous, young and women voters, Kanninen said, and Biden also hopes to shore up support from union workers.\n\nIn a pair of interviews with Spanish-language outlets that aired Tuesday, Biden blasted his predecessor\u2019s remarks about migrants and Latinos.\n\n\u201cThis guy (Trump) despises Latinos \u2014 I understand Latino values,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know \u2014 we just celebrated St. Patrick\u2019s Day, I hope you\u2019re not offended by me saying this, but you know, the thing about the Irish that came here, they\u2019re about family, they\u2019re about faith, they\u2019re about decency, and that\u2019s exactly what the Latino community is all about,\u201d Biden told Univision\u2019s \u201cEl Bueno, La Mala y El Feo.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cLatinos were essential to my win in 2020, and again they\u2019re essential, working hard to earn their vote. Earliest ever ad campaign to communicate directly with Latino voters about what we\u2019ve done, in English and Spanish. The campaign is organizing on the ground in our Latino communities.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Belt swing is part of the Biden campaign\u2019s March month of action, building off what his team viewed as a successful State of the Union address with travel to every battleground state. Senior campaign advisers have argued the Western states \u2013 along with the so-called blue wall and two Southern states - will be key to their pathway to 270 electoral votes.\n\n\u201cAcross the Southwest, Donald Trump and his extreme MAGA agenda have taken over the Republican Party establishment, causing deep divisions among traditional GOP voters and an opening for Democrats that has increasingly become a trendline,\u201d Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden\u2019s campaign manager, wrote in a memo.\n\nIn the weeks since the State of the Union, Biden has traveled to Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, along with New Hampshire, and the president and Vice President Kamala Harris plan on visiting North Carolina, a state the campaign sees as a possible pickup opportunity, next week.\n\nIt comes as the campaign is also scaling up its battleground operation, including expanding its brick-and-mortar presence with more than 100 new offices and 350 new team members \u2013 including 40 across Nevada and Arizona, Chavez Rodriguez\u2019s memo said.",

            "text": "Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said over the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February.\n\nWashington:\n\nJoe Biden may be facing off against Donald Trump in the polls ahead of the US presidential election in November, but his numbers are looking good in one department: campaign finance.\n\nDemocrats are ahead of their Republican opponents in fundraising, while Trump is burning through legal fees as he navigates multiple criminal and civil cases.\n\nThe cash shortage has also given the 81-year-old Biden a new direction of attack on the campaign trail, as he mocked the self-proclaimed billionaire tycoon\u2019s growing financial woes.\n\n\u201cJust the other day, a guy who looked like a loser came up to me and said, \u2018Mr. President, I need your help, I\u2019m overwhelmed with debt, I\u2019m totally broke,'\u201d he said at a fundraiser Zhong said. Wednesday in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\u201cDonald, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help you,\u201d Biden said, drawing laughter and applause from supporters.\n\nBiden\u2019s financial advantage could help soothe Democratic nerves as the nation\u2019s oldest president suffers record-low approval ratings less than seven months into his rematch with Trump.\n\nDocuments filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday showed that the Biden campaign had $71 million in cash on hand as of the end of February, more than double Trump\u2019s $33.5 million in cash.\n\nIn February alone, the current president\u2019s campaign raised $21.3 million, nearly double Trump\u2019s $10.9 million. Meanwhile, Biden spent $6.3 million that month, but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nHowever, the numbers don\u2019t give a complete picture of any individual candidate, as documents from their various fundraising committees aren\u2019t due until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said over the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, for a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most money raised by a Democratic Party at this stage of the election cycle.\n\n-\u201cDumpster Fire\u201d-\n\nPerhaps Trump\u2019s most worrying factor is his massive legal bills as he faces criminal cases, including ones seeking to overturn his 2020 election defeat and keep secret documents.\n\nLegal fees accounted for a whopping $5.6 million of Trump\u2019s Save America PAC\u2019s expenses in February \u2014 money that could have been spent on campaign events and television ads.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he works to raise $464 million in bonds to appeal a fine imposed by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces asset seizure, a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump has called the fraud a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and, as usual, is trying to use the legal cases against him to inflame his supporters and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on one million Trump-supporting patriots to say: Stop the witch hunt against President Trump!\u201d Wednesday\u2019s campaign message said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKeep your dirty hands away from Trump Tower,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk of a court case.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump successfully raised a separate bond of $91.6 million as he appealed sexual assault and defamation convictions in a lawsuit filed by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign described Trump\u2019s finances as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s documents paint a bleak picture for the Republican Party,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Amal Moussa wrote Thursday.\n\nBut as the election approaches and Trump leads Biden in key battleground states in recent polls, Democrats will try to keep their war chest as deep as possible.\n\nBiden will join Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at a fundraiser in New York on March 28, the first such event to feature three Democratic presidents. One of the most profitable events in the party\u2019s history.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the gala will raise $10 million for Biden\u2019s campaign, and guests will have to pay $100,000 each to take photos with the 42nd, 44th and 46th President of the United States.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

            "text": "Every March, in celebration of National Women\u2019s History Month, the Department of State issues its \u201cWomen of Courage\u201d award. This award is given to women around the world who have advanced the cause of peace, justice, and human rights\u2014often at great personal cost. This year, one name was glaringly absent from the list: Venezuela\u2019s Maria Corina Machado. Machado is not only leading the charge against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s dictatorship in Venezuela but also facing down the Biden administration\u2019s push to yet again appease the dictatorship at the expense of our democratic allies.\n\nDespite heavy-handed repression and the regime\u2019s control over electoral institutions, the Venezuelan opposition organized a decisive primary election in October 2023. Machado received an overwhelming mandate with 93 percent of the vote. Poll after poll in Venezuela shows widespread dissatisfaction with Maduro\u2014upwards of 80 percent. Such figures indicate that even the most egregious attempts to steal the election likely won\u2019t turn the tide.\n\nMaduro knows he does not stand a chance against her and is rightfully afraid of an open and competitive process. Despite her overwhelming victory in the primaries\u2014or likely because of it\u2014the regime-controlled Venezuelan Supreme Court has upheld an unconstitutional ban on Machado\u2019s ability to hold office. The regime has also imprisoned her allies and staff. However, the state is not targeting her alone. In the last few months, we\u2019ve seen extraordinary escalations in Venezuela, including the arrest and detention of human rights activist Rocio San Miguel, the legislative attempt to criminalize civil society, the murder of a Venezuelan dissident by Maduro-led gangs in Chile, the threat of a military invasion of Guyana, and the expulsion of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and her team. Over the years, the commissioner has diligently documented the extent of torture, arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings, and other human rights abuses that have forced over 7.7 million Venezuelans out of their country\u2014over 240,000 of whom illegally entered the United States last year alone.\n\nYet instead of holding the regime accountable for these actions, the White House has bizarrely relieved sanctions, providing the regime with additional resources for their human rights violations. They\u2019ve politely asked for the regime to \u201cdefine a process\u201d to reinstate Machado and other ineligible candidates but have exerted minimal pressure as Venezuela slides further and further into totalitarianism. With the regime announcing a 2024 Presidential election on July 28, there are whispers that the White House will lean on Machado to step down from her candidacy in favor of an opposition leader more palatable to Maduro and his cronies. This translates to a candidate that the regime can defeat.\n\nLet\u2019s call this what it is: Yankee imperialism. It\u2019s a term the left loves to throw around but rarely admits its practices. What other phrase describes a global power telling a small, persecuted opposition movement that their attempts at democracy are cute but that Washington would prefer to call the shots there? Even worse than that, it is imperialism in favor of dictatorship\u2014a capitulation to Maduro, a man whose greatest success prior to stealing the presidency of Venezuela was driving a bus\u2014and letting him decide who he runs against. Those are not the actions of a country that won two world wars against global tyranny. We would never allow a candidate to determine his presidential opponent in the United States\u2014we should not accept it in Venezuela, either.\n\nAt one point, the United States once stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Venezuelan opposition. Sadly, they now stand alone in their fight for freedom thanks to the Biden administration\u2019s failed policy of appeasement. Despite being abandoned, however, they remain undeterred. Venezuelans mobilized a primary candidate that garnered over 2.4 million votes. They organize daily both within the country and outside, drawing much-needed international attention to their suffering. In the opposition, we see an echo of the Venezuela that was once the most educated and wealthiest nation in South America. In them, we see an echo of the Venezuela that was a model for democracy in the region. But more importantly, in them\u2014and Maria Corina Machado\u2014we do not just see an echo of the past. We see a symbol of the future.\n\nThe Biden administration claims it rewards women with courage. Why, then, do we see them trying to penalize one in Maria Corina Machado?\n\nCarrie Filipetti is the Executive Director of The Vandenberg Coalition and the former Deputy Assistant Secretary and Deputy Special Representative for Venezuela in the Trump administration.\n\nImage: Shutterstock.com.",

When he introduced his presidential run in 2015, he pledged to self-finance his marketing campaign and crowed, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s cash.\u201d President Biden\u2019s reelection marketing campaign reported Wednesday that it has $71 million in money available \u2014 greater than double the $33.5 million that Trump\u2019s marketing campaign reported having.

Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (CO-03) said, \u201cJoe Biden has leveraged his elected position to enable the Biden family, their business associates, and their shell companies to receive over $24 million dollars from China and other entities. Biden is compromised and a threat to our national security. It is far past time Congress evict the resident in the White House and hold him accountable for selling out the American people.\u201d Background Courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability: Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis testified under oath President Joe Biden actively participated in his family\u2019s corrupt business dealings and acted as the closer for deals with Chinese and Russian entities. Mr. Tony Bobulinski, Biden family business associate: \u201cJoe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business; he was an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\u201d Mr. Jason Galanis, Biden family business associate: \u201cDuring the May 4th party, we were told to go to an area of the restaurant to gather because Hunter was going to call his father. Hunter called his father, said hello and \u2018hold on, Pops,\u2019 then put the call on speakerphone and said, \u2018I am here with our friends I told you were coming to town, and we wanted to say hello.\u2019 The Vice President said hello and some pleasantries [\u2026] and then seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, \u2018Ok then, you be good to my boy.\u2019 Hunter responded by saying, \u2018Everything is good, and we are moving ahead.\u2019 The Vice President said something about \u2018being helpful,\u2019 and Hunter ended the call by saying that he was going to call his father later. [\u2026] A few days after this May 4th party, an email my lawyer provided to this committee shows that Devon had confirmed Ms. Baturina was committed to a \u2018hard order\u2019 of $10-20 million in a Burnham investment banking client.\u201d The Bidens don\u2019t sell a product or a service or a set of skills. President Joe Biden is \u201cthe brand\u201d that the Biden family is selling for millions of dollars to those around the world willing to pay for it. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cI want to be crystal clear: from my direct personal experience and what I have subsequently come to learn, it is clear to me that Joe Biden was \u2018the Brand\u2019 being sold by the Biden family. His family\u2019s foreign influence peddling operation \u2013 from China to Ukraine and elsewhere \u2013 sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the United States government. Mr. Jason Galanis: \u201cThe entire value-add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.): \u201cThe scam is simple. It\u2019s done over and over again. The Biden family promises Joe\u2019s power, Joe Biden shows up, and millions of dollars come into the Bidens\u2019 pockets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio): \u201cMillions of dollars from foreign entities run through twenty different companies, for what? Devon Archer told us what it was for: Access to the brand. And the brand was Joe Biden. The brand that played rounds of golf, took calls and meetings, attended lunches and dinners with Hunter Biden and his business partners.\u201d Hunter Biden failed to appear alongside his business associates today because his testimony would not withstand public scrutiny when held up against witness facts and evidence uncovered showing Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in the business schemes. Hunter for months has requested a public hearing, but when offered one alongside his business associates, he failed to show up. Mr. Bobulinski: \u201cHow are the American people supposed to get the unvarnished facts and truth when the son and brother of Joe Biden are willing to perjure themselves to protect the family?\u201d President Joe Biden continues to lie directly to the American people about the central role he played in his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cWhy is Joe Biden blatantly lying to the American people? Why has he not simply leveled with the American people about all of the meetings, phone calls, emails and handshakes he has had with the Biden family\u2019s U.S. and foreign business partners, including players from some of America\u2019s most challenging adversaries such as China and Russia, as well as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania and others. If he were doing nothing wrong, why go through this insane exercise of obstructing and denying obvious facts?\u201d The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability released a video exposing Joe Biden\u2019s repeated lies about his family\u2019s influence peddling business. The video uses new footage from recent transcribed interviews with key witnesses who testified today. ###",

Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign racked up $1.4 million in debt to a private security firm, while the Biden administration has repeatedly denied his requests for Secret Service protection.\n\nAccording to their latest filing with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday, Kennedy's campaign raised $3.1 million in February but spent $2.8 million that same month. That is not including the $1.4 million the Kennedy campaign also owes to Gavin De Becker and Associates, the private security firm owned by De Becker, a security specialist and longtime friend of Kennedy, according to Politico.\n\nNot including withstanding debt, the campaign paid just over $200,000 last month for security services and related travel expenses, raising the total paid to Gavin de Becker & Associates to more than $2 million.\n\nMeanwhile, De Becker has donated millions in what he deemed both contributions and \"bridge funding\" to the pro-Kennedy super PAC American Values 2024. According to a separate FEC filing by the political action committee on Wednesday, De Becker donated another $4 million last month. That accounts for nearly all the total $4.1 million American Values 2024 reported garnering in February.\n\nCRUZ DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM MAYORKAS ON DENIAL OF SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION FOR RFK JR\n\nDe Becker has become the largest donor to the super PAC, second to Republican mega-donor Tim Mellon, Politico reported.\n\nDespite having raised nearly $28 million since kicking off his presidential campaign in April 2023, Kennedy has spent heavily. At the end of February, the campaign reported $5 million in cash on hand. Biden's campaign reported $71 million in cash on hand at the end of February, and former President Trump's campaign reported $33.5 million in cash on hand, Wednesday's FEC filings show.\n\nKennedy has assailed Biden for having rejected at least three requests for U.S. Secret Service protection while on the 2024 campaign trail. His father, former U.S. senator, U.S. Attorney General and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968, and his uncle, former President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963,\n\nRFK JR TRESPASSER INCLUDED IN SECRET SERVICE RISK ASSESSMENT MONTHS BEFORE DHS DENIED PROTECTION: SOURCE\n\nAs recently as December, Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas deemed that Secret Service protection for Kennedy \"is not warranted at this time,\" according to a letter obtained by Deseret News. According to Kennedy, that was despite several documented death threats against him.\n\nIn late October, a man was arrested twice for trespassing at Kennedy's home twice in the same day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe suspect, Jonathan Macht, was listed in a Secret Service risk assessment as part of the candidate's first request for protection in June, sources told Fox News Digital at the time. The assessment deemed Kennedy was at elevated risk, but the Democrat turned independent presidential candidate's request for protection was still denied by Homeland Security.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Donald Trump on Tuesday filed a U.S. Supreme Court brief in his bid for criminal immunity for trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, arguing that a former president enjoys \"absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his official acts.\"\n\nThe case is due to be argued before the justices on April 25. Trump has appealed a lower court's rejection of his request to be shielded from the criminal case being pursued by Special Counsel Jack Smith because he was serving as president when he took the actions at the center of the case.\n\nThe filing advances arguments similar to ones Trump's lawyers previously have made and echoes statements he has made on the campaign trail as he seeks to regain the presidency.\n\n\"The president cannot function, and the presidency itself cannot retain its vital independence, if the president faces criminal prosecution for official acts once he leaves office,\" the filing said.\n\nTrump, the first former president to be criminally prosecuted, is the Republican candidate challenging Democrat President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Biden defeated Trump in 2020.\n\n\"A denial of criminal immunity would incapacitate every future president with de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and condemn him to years of post-office trauma at the hands of political opponents. The threat of future prosecution and imprisonment would become a political cudgel to influence the most sensitive and controversial presidential decisions, taking away the strength, authority and decisiveness of the presidency,\" according to Trump's filing.\n\nSmith was appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022. In August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case, including conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against right of Americans to vote.\n\nIn a filing to the justices in February, Smith sought to make the case against presidential immunity.\n\n\"The nation has a compelling interest in seeing the charges brought to trial,\" Smith said in the filing, adding that \"the public interest in a prompt trial is at its zenith where, as here, a former president is charged with conspiring to subvert the electoral process so that he could remain in office.\"\n\nSmith said Trump's criminal charges reflect an alleged effort to \"perpetuate himself in power and prevent the lawful winner of the 2020 presidential election from taking office. The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments on Trump's immunity bid next month postponed the trial, giving him a boost as he tries to delay prosecutions while running to regain the presidency. Trump has three other pending criminal cases. He has pleaded not guilty in all four cases, seeking to paint them as politically motivated.\n\nTrump last October sought to have the charges dismissed based on his claim of immunity. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected that claim in December.\n\nOn appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Feb. 6 ruled 3-0 against Trump's immunity claim, rejecting his bid for \"unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and implementation of election results.\"\n\nThe case once again thrusts the nation's top judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into the election fray.\n\nTrump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden's victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump's supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to prevent the certification.\n\nIf Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.",

            "text": "Cleavages within the party could further complicate President Joe Biden's path to reelection.\n\nUS President Joe Biden attempted to flip the script on immigration during his State of the Union address last Thursday, calling out Republicans for tanking the bipartisan immigration bill that also included funding for Ukraine and Israel. Noting that \u201cconservatives got together\u201d with Senate Democrats and \u201csaid it was a good bill\u201d before former President Donald Trump pressed congressional Republicans to oppose it, he asserted that Trump should ask Congress to support the compromise \u201cinstead of playing politics.\u201d\n\nRecent polls show that immigration is one of the top concerns for the American electorate who tend to rate Biden poorly on this issue. While a majority of Democrats across the board welcome immigrants and support a path to citizenship for undocumented migrants, there are some significant differences between moderate and liberal Democrats on the appropriate levels of legal immigration and whether to differentiate acceptance of immigrants by their country of origin. These cleavages could further complicate the 2024 election landscape as Biden struggles to hold together his winning 2020 electoral coalition.\n\nKey Findings\n\nRelatively few liberal (11%) and moderate Democrats (29%) consider immigration a critical threat.\n\nA larger majority of liberal than moderate Democrats support a path to citizenship for undocumented workers without any conditions (65% vs. 51%).\n\nHalf of both liberal (46%) and moderate (52%) Democrats support maintaining current levels of legal immigration. But liberals tend to endorse increasing legal immigration (44%) over decreasing it (9%), while moderates are slightly more likely to say it should be decreased (27%) than increased (20%).\n\nMajorities from both Democratic camps favor accepting migrants from Taiwan, Ukraine, Haiti, Central America, India, and Korea.\n\nMajorities of liberal Democrats also favor accepting immigrants from Sudan, Afghanistan, Russia, and China; moderates are at best divided and often opposed.\n\nDemocrats Tilt Leftward\n\nIn the 2023 Chicago Council Survey, 60 percent of Democrats describe themselves as liberal (10 percent extremely liberal, 35 percent liberal, and 15 percent slightly liberal). The rest consider themselves to be moderate or middle of the road (32%), and a handful consider themselves some degree of conservative (5% slightly, 2% conservative, 1% extremely conservative). For the purposes of this analysis, we grouped moderate and conservative Democrats together and refer to them as simply \u201cmoderates\u201d (see appendix for more detail on these groups).\n\nDemocrats have steadily become more liberal since 2016. They were more or less evenly divided between 2014 and 2016. Prior to that, a majority considered themselves to be moderate or conservative. Liberal Democrats tend to be younger and from more diverse backgrounds, are more likely to express a favorable view of Biden (86%) than moderates (72%), and are also more likely to have very favorable views of Biden (38% liberals, 23% moderates).\n\nMajorities of Democrats Say Increasing Diversity Makes the Country Better\n\nTrump rode to prominence in 2015 on the backs of immigrants; namely, insulting and criticizing US immigration policy in language unheard of from any recent presidential candidate. While these comments seem to resonate with the Republican base who view immigration as a critical threat to the United States (72%), they don\u2019t have as much significance for Democrats. Relatively few Democrats see immigration as a critical threat (18% overall Democrats), though moderate Democrats are more likely to view it as a threat (29%) than liberal Democrats (11%).\n\nDemocrats tend to embrace the melting pot view of the United States. Majorities of both moderates and liberals say that the increasing number of people from many different races, nationalities, and ethnic groups makes the United States a better country to live in (84% liberal, 56% moderate). But while liberal Democrats decisively state that increasing diversity makes the country a lot better (61%, 23% a little better), moderates are divided between those who say it makes the country a lot (28%) or a little better (28%). A third of moderate Democrats say diversity makes no difference (33%, 13% liberals).\n\nModerates More Likely Than Liberals to Favor Conditions for a Path to Citizenship\n\nMuch of the controversy over immigration today centers around the 11 million unauthorized immigrants who live in the United States without legal status. Asked specifically about undocumented immigrants living in the United Sates, majorities of Democrats support a path to citizenship for undocumented workers (87% liberal, 77% moderate Democrats) and very few say that those living and working in the United States should be forced to leave the country (4% liberal, 9% moderate).\n\nBut there are some slight differences within the party faithful: two-thirds of liberal Democrats (65%) support a path to citizenship without any conditions, compared to just half of moderate Democrats (51%).\n\nThese differences are even sharper when asked about undocumented workers without mentioning whether they are currently working or not. In this case, majorities of Democrats across the ideological spectrum continue to support a path to citizenship (88% liberal, 70% moderate). But while a majority of liberal Democrats (58%) support an unconditional path, only a minority of moderate Democrats (38%) say the same. And 22 percent of moderate Democrats\u2014compared to 8 percent of liberals\u2014say these immigrants should be deported.\n\nDemocrats Prefer to Keep Legal Immigration Levels Stable\n\nSome immigration experts contend that the United States needs to significantly increase immigration each year to expand the future workforce and its competitive advantage. Overall, half of Democrats support keeping legal immigration at present levels, while a third prefer it be increased (35%) and 16 percent prefer a decrease. Similar to the percentage for overall Democrats, half of both liberal (46%) and moderate (52%) Democrats support maintaining current levels. But liberals are far more likely to endorse increasing legal immigration (44%) over decreasing it (9%), while moderates are slightly more likely to say it should be decreased (27%) than increased (20%).\n\nModerates Much More Selective about Which Immigrants They\u2019d Welcome\n\nOver the past year, migrants have entered the United States from a wider range of countries than in previous years. While Democrats overall are more welcoming to immigrants from a greater range of countries than other partisans, liberal and moderate Democrats do not always agree on whether or not the United States should accept immigrants from certain countries. Majorities from both Democratic camps favor accepting immigrants from Taiwan, Ukraine, Haiti, Central America, India, and South Korea, though liberals are more enthusiastic in their welcome. There are sharper ideological divisions for other potential immigrant-origin nations. While majorities of liberal Democrats also favor accepting immigrants from Sudan, Afghanistan, Russia, and China, moderates are at best divided and often opposed.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs immigration soars at the southern border with a record high of 3.2 million encounters in 2023, so has its significance as an American election issue (though it remains a low priority for Democrats). Biden is attempting to blame Republicans\u2014especially House Republicans\u2014 for ducking bipartisan cooperation to start fixing the border crisis. At the same time, some analysts comment that Biden\u2019s shift to the right on immigration could irk some on the progressive wing of his party and dampen his ability to cobble together his winning 2020 coalition.\n\nStrengthening the southern border is an issue that has the potential to divide that coalition. While liberal Democrats tend to say US leaders are paying too much attention to the US-Mexico border (at a 42% plurality), moderate Democrats say US leaders are not paying enough attention to the issue (a plurality of 43%). Prior Council polling shows that moderate Democrats are distinctly more likely than liberals to view increased border security as an effective approach to the issue, while both support a path to citizenship and reject Trump-era family separation policies. Whether those moderate Democrats will give Biden credit for his current positioning absent actual legislative success remains to be seen.",

            "text": "President Biden\u2019s reelection campaign is eyeing North Carolina as a state to flip in 2024, a place where former President Trump barely eked out a win the last time the two went head-to-head.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign acknowledges it will \u201ctake relentless effort\u201d to reach every voter it can by November, the Tar Heel State is seen as an opportunity, especially given a gubernatorial race that could boost Biden.\n\nBut strategists question how feasible that goal is, given the state hasn\u2019t gone to a Democrat since 2008 and went to Trump in his last two White House bids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still aspirational, but the state is definitely in play,\u201d said GOP strategist Doug Heye. \u201cTrump should win it. If I were betting on it, I would bet Trump would win.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina is part of the Biden campaign\u2019s pathway-to-270 strategy through critical swing states, which include the so-called blue wall made up of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin; western battlegrounds including Nevada and Arizona; and southern states such as Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina is included as part of a $30 million six-week advertising blitz the campaign announced after the State of the Union address to spend big in battleground states. Biden recently did radio interviews around Super Tuesday in Fayetteville and Charlotte to reach Black North Carolinians, one of several voting factions key to another victory.\n\nBiden and Vice President Harris will travel to North Carolina on March 26 as part of their effort to travel to every battleground state in March.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolinians know that while President Biden is fighting for us, Donald Trump is fighting for billionaires, corporations, and an extreme agenda that hurts our families and our economy,\u201d Biden campaign\u2019s North Carolina communications director Dory MacMillan told The Hill. \u201cOur campaign will continue to communicate across every corner of this state to reject Trump\u2019s attacks on our families and earn four more years of progress with President Biden.\u201d\n\nThe campaign currently has a $155 million war chest, but aside from spending and infrastructure, a major factor that strategists say can help Biden in the Tar Heel State is the governor\u2019s race, which includes far-right Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson on the ballot.\n\n\u201cGiven the very weak Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina and a very sophisticated operation from the Democratic candidate, the Biden team will have an even better opportunity to win there this time around because of the demographic shifts and a robust coordinated campaign in a state he barely lost,\u201d said Michael LaRosa, first lady Jill Biden\u2019s traveling press secretary during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMike Lonergan, the communications director for Mark Robinson for Governor, criticized Biden and Robinson\u2019s Democratic opponent Josh Stein in a statement to The Hill, saying Stein \u201cstands with President Biden\u2019s open-borders policies and would turn North Carolina into a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants; and he\u2019s backed by far-left radicals that want to defund the police.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cThe Democrats will stop at nothing to smear Mark Robinson because they know North Carolina voters have had enough of extremism and lies from career politicians like Joe Biden and Josh Stein.\u201d\n\nTrump barely beat Biden in North Carolina last time around by less than 1 percentage point. The last Democrat to win the state in a presidential contest was then-Democratic nominee Barack Obama, but he lost his reelection bid there to 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney by 2 percentage points. Trump won the state when he ran for the White House the first time in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by nearly 4 points.\n\nAn aggregation of polls shows Trump with a 7.4 point lead over Biden in North Carolina, a wider lead than the former president has managed in other battleground states.\n\n2024 could prove to be a split-ticket situation in North Carolina, where Democratic gubernatorial nominee Josh Stein wins while Trump takes the state, considering that when Trump won the state in 2020, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper was reelected to a second term.\n\nThe GOP nominee for superintendent, who would oversee the public schools in North Carolina, is also troubling to some moderate Republicans. Social media posts have emerged of Michele Morrow calling for former President Obama to be publicly executed, CNN reported.\n\nGiven the slate of Republican candidates, Democrats believe pouring efforts into North Carolina is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a smart bet,\u201d said Ivan Zapien, former official at the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThe Republicans have nominated some down-ballot candidates that are not going to do well in the suburbs, assuming the suburbs perform like they have been performing [in] the last cycles. It\u2019s ripe for a pickup.\u201d\n\nStill, Democrats acknowledge it\u2019s an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is ripe to flip, but it\u2019s still North Carolina,\u201d LaRosa said.\n\nRepublicans like Heye, a North Carolina native, say the state\u2019s not a forgone conclusion given its demographic developments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an outside chance that the Democrats take it because of the closeness of the state, because of the fast growth in the state, particularly in two parts \u2014 Charlotte and Raleigh and their suburban areas,\u201d he said.\n\nGrowth in areas like Charlotte and Raleigh has comprised an uptick in young, professional, suburban women, who helped give Democrats better-than-expected results in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nBlack voters are also a pivotal voting bloc in North Carolina, which is home to 11 historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nJim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, compared North Carolina to Georgia, a state that helped push Biden over the edge in 2020 in large part because of support from Black voters.\n\n\u201cThey each have a growing share of college-educated voters that have become essential for Democrats. Georgia has more African American voters, which proved to be the difference in 2020, but North Carolina is starting to look like the kind of state where Democrats should prevail,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story was updated at 8:57 p.m.\n\nFOLLOW US ON GOOGLE NEWS\n\nRead original article here",

            "text": "Biden Announces Strictest Vehicle Emission Regulation Ever\n\nPresident Joe Biden unveiled the strictest regulation on vehicle exhaust emissions ever in the US in a bid to drive the sales of electric cars. The Environmental Protection Agency reported that this move will prevent 7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 30 years. It includes a target of 56% of all new US vehicles sold to be electric by 2032, a huge leap from the 8% of new cars EVs accounted for last year. Biden\u2019s measure limits the amount of pollution permitted from vehicle exhausts each year, with stiff fines awaiting carmakers who fail to comply. Car companies will be allowed to make gas-powered cars, as long as the percentage of their total product line shrinks. Donald Trump, in his bid to be re-elected, said he plans to reverse many of the environmental changes made by Biden. \"The rules will force Americans to buy ultra-expensive cars they do not want and cannot afford while destroying the US auto industry in the process,\" said Karoline Leavitt of the Trump campaign. The average sale price of an EV in 2023, according to Kelly Blue Book, was $53,500, $5,000 more than gas-powered vehicles.",

Eine erneute Anh\u00f6rung im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus bringt die Demokraten in die Defensive.\n\nDie f\u00fcr die t\u00f6dliche Evakuierung Afghanistans verantwortlichen beiden rangh\u00f6chsten Gener\u00e4le wurden am Dienstag erneut auf den Pr\u00fcfstand gestellt. Die Republikaner im Repr\u00e4sentantenhaus verst\u00e4rkten ihre Kampagne, Pr\u00e4sident Biden f\u00fcr das Fiasko verantwortlich zu machen. Die Demokraten ihrerseits beschuldigten Donald Trump, die Bedingungen f\u00fcr den Zusammenbruch der Regierung in Kabul geschaffen zu haben.\n\nChaotischer Afghanistan-Abzug der USA wieder aufgerollt\n\nDie pensionierten Gener\u00e4le Mark A. Milley und Kenneth \u201eFrank\u201c McKenzie, Berufsmilit\u00e4rs, haben unter beiden Pr\u00e4sidenten in leitenden Funktionen gedient. Sie sagten vor dem Ausschuss f\u00fcr ausw\u00e4rtige Angelegenheiten des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses im Rahmen seiner Untersuchung des katastrophalen Ausstiegs der Vereinigten Staaten aus einem 20-j\u00e4hrigen Krieg im August 2021 aus.\n\nGeneral Mark A. Milley, der damalige Vorsitzende der Generalstabschefs, sagt 2022 im Capitol Hill aus. \u00a9 Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post\n\nMcKenzie sagte, dass das Pentagon zwar einen Plan f\u00fcr den Abzug aller US-Truppen, Diplomaten, B\u00fcrger und gef\u00e4hrdeten afghanischen Partner Monate, bevor die Taliban an die Macht zur\u00fcckgekehrt sind, ausgearbeitet hatte. Biden aber stattdessen beschloss, die US-Botschaft offen zu lassen und bis auf ein paar Hundert Soldaten alle abzuziehen - und damit Zehntausende in Gefahr zu lassen.\n\nThe Washington Post vier Wochen gratis lesen Ihr Qualit\u00e4ts-Ticket der washingtonpost.com: Holen Sie sich exklusive Recherchen und 200+ Geschichten vier Wochen gratis.\n\nEvakuierung durch Bidens Au\u00dfenministerium \u201ezu langsam, zu sp\u00e4t\u201c\n\n\u201eIch denke, der grundlegende Fehler \u2013 der grundlegende Makel \u2013 war der Zeitpunkt des Aufrufs des Au\u00dfenministeriums zur Evakuierung\u201c, sagte Milley. \u201eIch denke, das war zu langsam und zu sp\u00e4t, und das hat dann zu der Reihe von Ereignissen gef\u00fchrt, die sich in den letzten paar Tagen ergeben haben.\u201c\n\nDas wiederkehrende politische Rampenlicht auf die letzten Tage des Konflikts, die von Szenen grausamer Gewalt und Verzweiflung gepr\u00e4gt waren, hat die Demokraten gezwungen, sich mit einem dunklen Moment in Bidens Amtszeit als Pr\u00e4sident auseinanderzusetzen - w\u00e4hrend dieser gegen seinen Vorg\u00e4nger f\u00fcr eine zweite Amtszeit als Oberbefehlshaber k\u00e4mpft.\n\nViele demokratische Abgeordnete haben sich ihren republikanischen Kollegen angeschlossen und den Umgang der Regierung mit dem R\u00fcckzug kritisiert. Doch angesichts der bevorstehenden Neuauflage des Duells zwischen Trump und Biden stehen sie unter Druck, seine Position zu verteidigen.\n\nGerangel um Verantwortung f\u00fcr den R\u00fcckzug des US-Milit\u00e4r in Afghanistan\n\nW\u00e4hrend der gesamten Anh\u00f6rung versuchten beide Seiten abwechselnd, ihren Respekt f\u00fcr die Gener\u00e4le zu demonstrieren. Gleichzeitig wollten sie sie dazu dr\u00e4ngen, den Pr\u00e4sidenten der anderen Partei als die Person anzuerkennen, die letztlich f\u00fcr das Evakuierungsfiasko verantwortlich ist.\n\nDer Ausschussvorsitzende Michael McCaul (Republikaner) sagte, das Wei\u00dfe Haus habe sich geweigert, auf Warnungen zu h\u00f6ren, was in Afghanistan passiere, als die Taliban auf ihrem Marsch nach Kabul St\u00e4dte und Bezirke zur\u00fcckeroberten. Das Au\u00dfenministerium habe erst am 14. August 2021 zu einer vollst\u00e4ndigen Evakuierung aufgerufen \u2013 einen Tag, bevor die afghanische Regierung aus dem Land floh und Tausende von Zivilisten den Flughafen der Stadt in dem verzweifelten Versuch \u00fcberrannten, sich selbst zu evakuieren.\n\nDer Abgeordnete Michael McCaul (R-TX) spricht bei einer Anh\u00f6rung des Ausschusses f\u00fcr ausw\u00e4rtige Angelegenheiten des Repr\u00e4sentantenhauses im Kapitol der Vereinigten Staaten am 19.03.2024. \u00a9 Michael Brochstein/Imago\n\n\u201eWie das Sprichwort sagt: \u201aWer daran scheitert, zu planen, plant zu scheitern\u2018\u201c, sagte McCaul \u00fcber die Regierung Biden. \u201eUnd gescheitert sind sie.\u201c Er erstellte einen Zwischenbericht zum zweiten Jahrestag der Evakuierung im vergangenen August und wird voraussichtlich im Sommer eine endg\u00fcltige Version ver\u00f6ffentlichen.\n\nBidens Beh\u00f6rden waren nicht ausreichend vorbereitet\n\nEine Untersuchung des Au\u00dfenministeriums, die im Juni letzten Jahres ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, ergab, dass die Beh\u00f6rde \u201eauf h\u00f6chster Ebene nur unzureichend \u00fcber Worst-Case-Szenarien nachgedacht hat\u201c. Auch h\u00e4tte sie nicht ber\u00fccksichtigt, wie schnell diese eintreten k\u00f6nnten, nachdem Biden beschlossen hatte, Trumps Entscheidung zum R\u00fcckzug zu befolgen. Die Beh\u00f6rde hatte auch niemanden, der eindeutig f\u00fcr die Vorbereitung einer vollst\u00e4ndigen Evakuierung zust\u00e4ndig war, so das Ergebnis der Untersuchung.\n\nEin Beamter des Au\u00dfenministeriums sagte bez\u00fcglich der Anh\u00f6rung am Dienstag, die Beh\u00f6rde sei \u201esehr stolz auf die Arbeit, die unter unglaublich schwierigen Umst\u00e4nden geleistet wurde, um die Umsiedlung von US-B\u00fcrgern, Personen mit st\u00e4ndigem Wohnsitz in den USA und Afghanen w\u00e4hrend des Abzugs und in der darauf folgenden Zeit sicherzustellen\u201c.\n\nBeide Gener\u00e4le im Ruhestand sagten, ihre Ausf\u00fchrungen st\u00fcnden im Einklang mit stundenlangen Aussagen, die sie w\u00e4hrend ihrer aktiven Dienstzeit gemacht h\u00e4tten \u2013 ein Punkt, den Repr\u00e4sentant Gregory W. Meeks (N.Y.), der f\u00fchrende Demokrat im Ausschuss, zu betonen versuchte. \u201eHier gibt es nichts Bahnbrechendes!\u201c, sagte Meeks und forderte die Gesetzgeber auf, stattdessen die Gesamtheit des Krieges zu betrachten und nicht nur sein Ende. Die \u00fcberparteiliche Afghanistan-Kriegskommission, die letztes Jahr einberufen wurde, um den gesamten 20-j\u00e4hrigen Krieg zu untersuchen, wird voraussichtlich innerhalb von vier Jahren Ergebnisse vorlegen.\n\nExplosion in Kabul t\u00f6tete w\u00e4hrend des Truppenabzugs 183 Menschen\n\nBei der Anh\u00f6rung waren auch die Familien mehrerer US-Soldaten anwesend, die bei einem Bombenanschlag am Rande des Flughafens von Kabul get\u00f6tet wurden, als die 17-t\u00e4gige Evakuierung sich dem Ende neigte. Die Explosion folgte auf tagelange \u00f6ffentliche Warnungen der Regierung Biden, dass der Islamische Staat, der einen Ableger in Afghanistan unterh\u00e4lt, kurz vor einem Angriff stehe. Bei dem Selbstmordanschlag starben sch\u00e4tzungsweise 170 Afghanen und 13 amerikanische Soldaten. Dutzende weitere wurden verwundet.\n\nDie Republikaner Cory Mills und Michael Lawler kritisierten McKenzie und Milley daf\u00fcr, dass sie nicht die Aussage eines Scharfsch\u00fctzen der Marines, Sgt. Tyler Vargas-Andrews, beachtet haben. Dieser sagte, dass er kurz vor dem Angriff einen Mann in der Menge sah, auf den die Beschreibung des Selbstmordattent\u00e4ters zutraf, ihm aber die Erlaubnis verweigert wurde, ihn zu erschie\u00dfen. Vargas-Andrews, der bei der Explosion schwer verwundet wurde und bei der Anh\u00f6rung am Dienstag anwesend war, hat den Gesetzgebern im vergangenen Jahr einen emotionalen Bericht \u00fcber den Bombenanschlag und seine Folgen vorgelegt, der das Pentagon veranlasste, die Ergebnisse seiner Untersuchung des Vorfalls zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Es wird erwartet, dass die Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchung bald ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden.\n\nBiden: \u00dcbernahme Afghanistans durch die Taliban sei \u201eh\u00f6chst unwahrscheinlich\u201c gewesen\n\nMcKenzie und die Verantwortlichen des Pentagon erkl\u00e4rten der \u00d6ffentlichkeit im Jahr 2022, dass der Bombenanschlag auf den Flughafen \u201enicht zu verhindern\u201c gewesen sei. Der Abgeordnete Michael Waltz (Republikaner), ein pensionierter Offizier der Special Forces, sagte, er sei w\u00fctend, wenn er sich daran erinnere, wie Biden in den Wochen vor der Krise die Aussicht heruntergespielt habe, dass Afghanistan an die Taliban fallen k\u00f6nnte. In einem Fall, so Waltz, habe Biden im Juli 2021 gesagt, es sei \u201eh\u00f6chst unwahrscheinlich\u201c, dass die Taliban das Land \u00fcberrennen w\u00fcrden \u2013 obwohl die Gener\u00e4le privat davor gewarnt h\u00e4tten, dass ein solches Ergebnis schnell eintreten k\u00f6nne.\n\n\u201eMeine Einsch\u00e4tzung war damals: Wenn wir die US-Streitkr\u00e4fte auf null reduzieren w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrden die afghanischen Regierung und die [afghanischen Streitkr\u00e4fte] sehr wahrscheinlich zusammenbrechen und die Taliban w\u00fcrden die Macht \u00fcbernehmen\u201c, sagte Milley am Dienstag. \u201eAber ich pers\u00f6nlich dachte, es w\u00fcrde im Herbst sein, irgendwo um Thanksgiving herum. Die Einsch\u00e4tzungen gingen weit auseinander.\u201c\n\nDas Wei\u00dfe Haus, das zu Milleys Aussage befragt wurde, zitierte ein Dokument, das das Wei\u00dfe Haus im vergangenen Fr\u00fchjahr ver\u00f6ffentlicht hatte. In dem hei\u00dft es, dass Biden bei seinem Amtsantritt einen \u201ebewussten, intensiven, strengen und umfassenden Entscheidungsprozess\u201c \u00fcber den Umgang mit dem Krieg eingeleitet habe. \u201eLetztendlich weigerte sich Pr\u00e4sident Biden, eine weitere Generation von Amerikanern in einen Krieg zu schicken, der f\u00fcr die Vereinigten Staaten schon l\u00e4ngst h\u00e4tte beendet sein sollen\u201c, hei\u00dft es darin.\n\nUS-Visa f\u00fcr evakuierte Afghanen werden knapp\n\nMehrere Demokraten auf dem Podium versuchten, die ihrer Meinung nach widerspr\u00fcchliche Haltung der Republikaner in der Afghanistan-Politik hervorzuheben. Sie wiesen darauf hin, dass die Emp\u00f6rung der Republikaner \u00fcber die Aufgabe von US-Verb\u00fcndeten sich in sinnvolle Hilfen f\u00fcr die zur\u00fcckgelassenen Afghanen und diejenigen, die in die Vereinigten Staaten umgesiedelt wurden, niederschlagen sollte. Die Verb\u00fcndeten waren w\u00e4hrend einer milit\u00e4rischen Luftbr\u00fccke, die 124.000 Menschen in Sicherheit brachte, gestrandet.\n\nF\u00fcrsprecher f\u00fcr Afghanen, zu denen auch f\u00fchrende Veteranengruppen des US-Milit\u00e4rs geh\u00f6ren, haben davor gewarnt, dass Tausende von Afghanen, die der US-Mission gedient haben, in Afghanistan verbleiben. Zudem k\u00f6nne das Au\u00dfenministerium bald keine speziellen Einwanderungsvisa mehr f\u00fcr sie ausstellen, wenn der Kongress nicht handelt.\n\nEs gibt etwa 20.000 Afghanen - ihre Familienangeh\u00f6rigen nicht mitgerechnet - die eine vorl\u00e4ufige Genehmigung erhalten haben und \u201ebald ein Visum ben\u00f6tigen\u201c. Dies schrieb eine \u00fcberparteiliche Gruppe von Senatoren unter der Leitung von Senatorin Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) letzte Woche in einem Brief an die Senatsf\u00fchrer. Am 1. M\u00e4rz \u201ewaren noch etwa 7.000 Visa \u00fcbrig\u201c, so die Gruppe.\n\nUngef\u00e4hrliche R\u00fcckkehr nach Afghanistan werde \u201eJahre dauern\u201c\n\nDemokrat Jason Crow, ein Armee-Veteran, der in Afghanistan gedient hat, forderte seine Kollegen auf, den Afghan Allies Protection Act zu unterzeichnen \u2013 eine partei\u00fcbergreifende Gesetzesvorlage, die immer wieder von den Republikanern vereitelt wird. Der Kongress k\u00f6nne immer noch \u201eLeben retten, indem er dieses Gesetz verabschiedet und unseren Freunden den Weg nach drau\u00dfen ebnet\u201c, so Crow.\n\nZu den Autoren Dan Lamothe arbeitet seit 2014 f\u00fcr die Washington Post und berichtet \u00fcber das US-Milit\u00e4r. Er schreibt seit mehr als 15 Jahren \u00fcber die Streitkr\u00e4fte, ist viel gereist, hat f\u00fcnf Teilstreitkr\u00e4fte kennengelernt und \u00fcber Kampfeins\u00e4tze in Afghanistan berichtet. Abigail Hauslohner ist Reporterin f\u00fcr nationale Sicherheit bei der Washington Post mit Schwerpunkt auf dem Kongress. In ihrem Jahrzehnt bei der Zeitung war sie als Korrespondentin unterwegs und schrieb \u00fcber Themen von Einwanderung bis hin zu politischem Extremismus und berichtete als B\u00fcroleiterin der Post in Kairo \u00fcber den Nahen Osten. Leigh Ann Caldwell ist Mitautorin von The Washington Post\u2018s Early 202 und besch\u00e4ftigt sich mit dem Kongress und der Politik. Au\u00dferdem ist sie Moderatorin bei Washington Post Live und f\u00fchrt Interviews mit hohem Nachrichtenwert. Bevor sie 2022 zu The Post kam, war Caldwell Korrespondentin bei NBC News, zuletzt als Mitglied der Kongressabteilung.\n\nDer Abgeordnete Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) fragte, wie lange es dauern wird, bis die Amerikaner Afghanistan auf \u00e4hnliche Weise besuchen k\u00f6nnen, wie er Vietnam besucht hat, um zu sehen, wo sein Vater get\u00f6tet wurde. \u201eEs wird Jahre dauern\u201c, antwortete Milley. \u201eIch glaube, dass die Taliban immer noch eine terroristische Organisation sind. Ich glaube immer noch, dass sie unglaubliche, grausame Vergeltungsma\u00dfnahmen in ihrem eigenen Land durchf\u00fchren, und ich w\u00fcrde keinem Familienmitglied zu diesem Zeitpunkt empfehlen, zur\u00fcckzukehren.\u201c\n\nMilley f\u00fcgte hinzu, dass es ihm schwer fallen werde, sich jemals mit den Taliban zu vers\u00f6hnen. \u201eIch werde wahrscheinlich damit ins Grab gehen\u201c, sagte er.\n\nWir testen zurzeit maschinelle \u00dcbersetzungen.

(Photo by Yasser Qudih/Xinhua)\n\nJERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday rejected the U.S. call to cancel a ground operation in Rafah city, where about 1.5 million displaced Palestinians resided, but agreed to send a delegation to Washington for discussions.\n\nThe White House confirmed in a statement that Netanyahu and U.S. President Joe Biden agreed in a phone call on Monday, that their teams would meet \"soon\" in Washington to \"exchange views and discuss alternative approaches\" to a major ground operation in Rafah.\n\nNetanyahu's office said in a statement that the delegation, led by Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, will be dispatched next week \"for the sake of the continuation of the fighting.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu said in an address to the parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that a ground assault is the only way to defeat Hamas militants in Rafah. He said he \"made it as clear as possible\" to Biden that Israel is \"determined to complete the elimination of (Hamas) battalions in Rafah, and there is no way to do this without a ground incursion.\"\n\nPeople wait to get free food in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on March 18, 2024. (Photo by Rizek Abdeljawad/Xinhua)\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli troops have continued their raid on the al-Shifa Hospital compound in Gaza City for the second day, attacking the enclave's largest hospital with tanks and airstrikes.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that the troops killed more than 50 Palestinian militants and about 300 have been detained during the raid, which targeted \"senior\" Hamas militants. Two Israeli soldiers were killed during the raid, IDF announced.\n\nIsrael launched its offensive on Gaza on Oct. 7 in response to Hamas's attack and immediately implemented a blockade on water, food, electricity, and medicine, creating acute shortages.\n\nPeople inspect a destroyed building after an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, March 19, 2024. (Photo by Khaled Omar/Xinhua)\n\nUN agencies and aid organizations assert that the quantity of aid permitted by Israel to enter Gaza falls short of the desperate needs required to prevent the imminent spread of famine.\n\n\"Projected imminent famine in Gaza can be prevented,\" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a video statement.\n\n\"The extent of Israel's restrictions on entry of aid, together with the manner in which it conducts hostilities, may amount to use of starvation as a method of war,\" he warned.\n\nHis remarks came a day after the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) released a report alarming that \"famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime between mid-March and May 2024.\"\n\nThe war has left about 1.1 million people, about half of Gaza's population, experiencing \"catastrophic\" hunger, according to the report.\n\nThe UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) warned on social media platform X that at least 23 children have already died of acute malnutrition and an increasing number of children are on the brink of death due to starvation, mainly in northern Gaza.\n\nA volunteer distributes free food in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on March 18, 2024.

Commenting on the report on X, the office of Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories, a governmental body, said that more than 200,000 tons of food entered Gaza since the start of the war, over 1,250 packages were airdropped and over 150 aid trucks reached northern Gaza in the last two weeks.\n\nThe Palestinian toll in Gaza has reached 31,819, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said Tuesday.\n\nEditor: GSY",

However, the report only covers a part of the committees associated with those running for office.\n\nWATCH | US Elections 2024: Nikki Haley backer Harry Sloan to donate to Biden Biden at the end of February, had $71 million in cash available in his main campaign account which is more than double of Trump\u2019s $33.5 million.\n\nThe filings show that the former president received more than $3 million in his campaign account in February, which added to the $30 million on hand in January.\n\nHowever, the incumbent president, which had $56 million by the end of January, added $15 million in February.\n\nWhile Trump is in the lead in more nationwide polls, Biden and the Democratic Party have a growing cash advantage.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, according to the filing, had more than twice the cash on hand when compared to its Republican counterpart.\n\nHowever, the report does not show the entire picture since Biden and Trump are raising money through joint fundraising committees which will not file their reports until the end of next month.\n\nA Trump campaign official told CNN that their campaign and joint fundraising committee brought in $20.3 million in February and they entered this month with a combined $41.9 million cash.\n\nThe amount still trails behind Biden\u2019s campaign which reported raising a combined $53 million in February across the committees supporting his re-election bid, with a combined total of a whopping $155 million.\n\nReasons behind the cash gap\n\nBiden, as the current president, reportedly has an advantage over Trump, who became the presumptive Republican nominee only in February.\n\nThe cash crunch has also reportedly prompted the former president to have meetings at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and even host private dinners with the Republican Party\u2019s biggest financiers.\n\nThe former president\u2019s lagging in terms of cash could also be attributed to his many legal woes as the filings also show the financial strain it is taking on his campaign. Trump is currently facing four criminal trials.\n\nAlso Read | Trump Tower among properties that could be seized to cover $454mn civil fraud fine\n\nThe financial disclosures of the group called Save America \u2013 which raises money together with Trump\u2019s election campaign but is legally separate and reportedly used to underwrite his lawyers\u2019 fees \u2013 showed that around $5.6 million was spent on legal bills in February.\n\nThe amount spent was the biggest single month of spending on legal bills since Trump formed the organisation in 2020 after his election defeat four years ago.\n\nThe filings also show that the group has spent more than $55 million on legal bills since the beginning of last year.",

            "text": "Mike Pence in Washington DC on 26 May 2020; Donald Trump in Des Moines, Iowa, on 10 January 2024. Photograph: Brendan Smialowskikamil Krzaczynski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump told his vice-president, Mike Pence, that refusing to block certification of Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 election victory at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 would be \u201ca political career killer\u201d, according to newly released testimony from a presidential valet.\n\n\u201cMike, this is a political career killer if you do this,\u201d Trump told Pence by phone on the morning of January 6, the New York Times reported, citing a transcript of testimony to the House committee that investigated the deadly attack on Congress that unfolded later that day.\n\nAccording to the Times, the unnamed valet also said Trump appeared unconcerned when he was told a civilian had been shot dead as the Capitol was stormed.\n\n\u201cI just remember seeing it in front of him,\u201d the valet said of a card given to Trump as he watched the riot on television. \u201cI don\u2019t remember how it got there or whatever. But there was no, like, reaction.\u201d\n\nThe woman who was killed, Ashli Babbitt, has become a martyr to the Trumpist far right. Trump has called her a \u201cgreat patriot\u201d. The police officer who shot her outside the House chamber was cleared of wrongdoing, a judgment with which Trump disagreed.\n\nEight other deaths, including law enforcement suicides, are now linked to the Capitol attack, which happened after Trump told supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to overturn Biden\u2019s win, which according to Trump\u2019s lie was the result of electoral fraud.\n\nMore than 1,200 arrests have been made over the riot and hundreds of convictions and sentences secured. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted by Senate Republicans. He is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president, despite facing 88 criminal charges (14 concerning election subversion) and multimillion-dollar penalties in civil lawsuits. The US supreme court rejected attempts to keep Trump off the ballot under the 14th amendment to the constitution, which bars insurrectionists from office.\n\nThe Times said it obtained the redacted transcript of the valet\u2019s testimony from House Republicans who claim the January 6 committee omitted from its hearings and report anything that did not suit its narrative.\n\nTranscripts contradicting sensational testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a close aide to Trump\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, have already been released.\n\nBarry Loudermilk of Georgia, the Republican leading the effort to undermine the work of the January 6 committee, told the Times there was \u201csome testimony in [the valet transcript] that may not be favorable to Trump\u201d but said: \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all out there, not doing what the select committee did, and putting things out there that will be favorable to our side.\u201d\n\nBennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chaired the January 6 committee, which included two anti-Trump Republicans, told the Times: \u201cDespite Mr Loudermilk\u2019s attempts to rewrite the violent history of January 6, the facts laid out in the select committee\u2019s final report remain undisputed \u2013 and nothing substantive was left out nor hidden.\n\n\u201cWhile the valet did not witness everything that happened in the White House that day, the testimony confirms Trump\u2019s indifference to the violence and his anger at Vice-President Pence for performing his duty under the constitution.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed valet said he did not remember Trump calling Pence what the Times called \u201can expletive meant to refer to a wimp\u201d, otherwise widely reported to have been the word \u201cpussy\u201d.\n\nAs the Times noted, Trump has not disputed the insult that was described to the January 6 committee by a former chief of staff to Ivanka Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe valet also said he did not remember Trump or any staff member commenting on how rioters chanted for Pence to be hanged. Hutchinson told the committee she heard aides saying Trump said Pence \u201cdeserved\u201d such a fate.\n\nThe valet said he heard Trump ask aides about how to send national guard troops to the Capitol, a deployment that took several hours as chaos reigned and a contentious issue since.\n\nThe valet also described \u201cdisbelief\u201d among White House staff as the situation at the Capitol worsened and Trump persisted in watching TV.\n\nPence escaped the rioters and ultimately returned to the Capitol to preside over certification, despite objections from 147 Republicans in the House and Senate. According to Trump\u2019s valet, the president \u201cjust mentioned that Mike let him down, and that was it\u201d.\n\nTrump has been proved right, however, about Pence committing a \u201cpolitical career killer\u201d. Portrayed as a hero by the January 6 committee, Pence ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Failing to make an impact, he withdrew well before the first primary vote.\n\nLast week, he exacted a measure of revenge \u2013 by refusing to endorse Trump in his rematch with Biden.\n\nBut Pence also said his differences with Trump were \u201cnot personal\u201d \u2013 and refused to say he would not vote for him.\n\nNews Related",

            "text": "After Trump's endorsement in big primary win, Republicans mull how to handle him in key Senate races\n\nSome Republicans say they are weighing how closely candidates in key Senate races should embrace former President Donald Trump after his preferred candidate romped in this week's Ohio GOP Senate primary.\n\nThe GOP is on offense in red states like Montana and Ohio and purple states like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as the party hopes to wrest the Senate from narrow Democratic control in November.\n\nMany observers and experts have expected that Republican candidates in those races will need at least some distance from Trump, who has early polling edges but still faces dour approval ratings with the broader electorate -- and who had proved unable to boost some of his marquee endorsees to victory in general election races, like Arizona in 2022.\n\nHowever, conservatives now tell ABC News they are reconsidering after businessman Bernie Moreno clinched the party's Senate nomination in Ohio -- and surprised the polls -- in the wake of earning Trump's support.\n\nAnd while Ohio is not as narrowly divided as other swing states hosting Senate races this year, Moreno's roughly 18-point margin of victory in a three-way race, along with Trump's outsized presence on the campaign trail and at the top of ballots this November, is causing some Republicans to consider the feasibility of having candidates distance themselves from their party leader.\n\n\"No, don't run away from it at all,\" said one GOP strategist with extensive experience working in Nevada, host of one of the nation's major Senate races later this year.\n\n\"Of those states, [Trump] right now is polling favorite, a tossup at least,\" said this strategist, who asked not to be quoted by name to be more candid. \"And also, voters don't buy it. You're a Republican. You're running with the Republican. Everybody kind of gets it.\"\n\nThere is another dynamic at work: Unlike in some past cycles, Republicans in Washington have worked diligently in 2024 to pave the way for noncontroversial candidates to clear Senate primary fields, offering early endorsements and additional support while boxing out other would-be contenders weighed down by ideological and personal baggage.\n\nThe strategy marks a departure from the national party's more laissez-faire approach in 2022 when divisive and scandalized candidates were able to clinch the GOP nomination and then lose competitive Senate races like those in Georgia and Pennsylvania. And so far, it's worked -- the party's preferred candidates are either running all by themselves or against resource-starved opponents in Montana, West Virginia, Wisconsin and more.\n\nThis year's crop of candidates, though, will have to navigate running in a presidential year when the quadrennial debate over how tightly to embrace the top of the ticket is ramped up for both parties.\n\nRepublicans, including those around Moreno, eye his bear hug of Trump and subsequent victory -- and see some evidence that distance from the top of the ticket won't necessarily punch candidates' way to the Senate.\n\n\"Bernie won because he had Donald Trump backing him and because Bernie reflected Donald Trump's 'America First' worldview, which is the dominant worldview in the Republican Party in 2024,\" said one Moreno adviser.\n\n\"The party of George Bush is dead and buried. As much as that pains some establishment Republicans to hear, it's just the reality. Running in the so-called establishment Bush lane in Republican primaries is a death spot,\" this person said.\n\nParty operatives cautioned, still, that that proximity to Trump isn't equally popular everywhere and doesn't replace the need for a candidate to establish their own brand, a necessity in politics generally but also in a cycle when handfuls of split-ticket voters could make an outsized impact in November.\n\nBut on the flip side, establishing a brand too removed from Trump may not be possible either.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump greets Ohio Republican candidate for US Senate Bernie Moreno during a rally in Vandalia, OH, March 16, 2024. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\n\"Every candidate, they're gonna run their own campaign. And that's always been the case,\" said GOP strategist Zack Roday. \"These candidates have to make a determination on what they're doing each day and every day, but they will be barnstorming these states, I'm sure the president will be barnstorming these states. I'm sure you'll see them together. And I'm sure that the campaigns will make a determination on what their emphasis is as we go into the really heavy spend period.\"\n\nMany Republicans have already made the calculation that tying their ship to Trump's is the best way to sail to the Senate.\n\nMoreno got a boost of attention among party voters by a late rally with Trump in Dayton, Ohio, days before primary voting. Kari Lake, the overwhelming favorite to win Arizona's GOP Senate primary, is such a close ally that her name was tossed around in the Trump \"veepstakes.\"\n\nAnd Tim Sheehy, who is virtually guaranteed to run against Montana Sen. Jon Tester, a Democratic, is touting his endorsement from the former president on the trail and running a banner about it at the top of his campaign website.\n\nOther Republican strategists, though, warn such proximity poses risks.\n\nPresidential primary results have shown Trump struggling to win back voters in the suburbs and among more moderate and independent-leaning blocs -- the same sore spots where President Joe Biden was able to run up the score in the 2020 general election, exit polling found.\n\n\"In a purple state, you do need to have some distance from Trump, because odds are you're going to have to out-poll Trump, and you want Trump to be your floor but not to be your ceiling,\" Chris Nicholas, a veteran Pennsylvania Republican consultant, told ABC News, adding that he \"would not put Ohio into the category of purple-y states.\"\n\nOther candidates have not distanced themselves from Trump as much as they've focused more on their own race.\n\nDave McCormick, Republicans' preferred candidate in Pennsylvania's Senate battle, has endorsed Trump's campaign but focused much of his campaign on knocking Biden and Democratic incumbent Bob Casey while promoting his military service, ties to the state and support for farmers, for example.\n\nTo be certain, Democrats are expected to have to walk a tightrope of their own given Biden's grim approval ratings, and drawing eyeballs to down-ballot races with such outsized personalities at the top of the ticket this year could be a struggle for both parties.\n\nAnd for all the focus on swing voters, Trump helps supercharge the Republican base, making an alliance potentially beneficial for down-ballot candidates, as evidenced in Ohio, where Moreno posted strong showings in key blue-collar counties -- precisely the kind of areas Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, his November opponent, has historically leaned on.\n\n\"Donald Trump is more popular than virtually every Republican Senate candidate,\" Moreno's adviser said. \"So Republicans push him away at their own peril.\"",

            "text": "Jan 25, 2023 \u2014 Francis's comments, which were hailed by gay rights advocates as a milestone, are the first uttered by a pope about such laws..\n\nNext, let's look at Francis is definitely pope pundit Tim Gordon explain the \u201cweaponized ambiguity\u201d of Vatican II:\n\nThis divergence between the two competing forms of Originalism proves especially relevant in the curious case of the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965), whose sacred constitutions threaten, in many progressive-sounding clauses, to contradict previous Catholic Tradition\u2014which would rupture the Faith. Catholics who believe the Church was not vituperated by the revolutionary intent of Vatican Two\u2019s leading periti became practical textualists in 1965 when the Council\u2019s last constitution was ratified.\n\nAfter all, the strong majority intent at the Council was, undeniably, radically progressive. The story is well-known even to most non-Catholics. Many revolutionary Council fathers authored the VC2 constitutions with what Monsignor Charles Pope calls \u201cweaponized ambiguity,\u201d constitutional text designed to be radicalized retroactively, as theory turned to practice in the immediate post-conciliar period.\n\nWe\u2019ve all watched this catastrophe play out over fifty years. As Edward Schillebeeckx said of his contingent\u2019s tactic: \u201cwe knew at the time how we would later interpret the [vaguely written] documents.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the sacred constitutions of VC2 prescribed a poison pill of technically sound doctrine to be subsequently fashioned into unsound, unCatholic praxis. The question for Catholics like Vermeule, Arkes, and myself is: does the \u201creal\u201d meaning of Vatican Two reduce to its documents\u2019 intent, or to their ambiguously revolutionary yet (mostly) innocuous original public meaning? Only textualism can capably explain how regardless of the abiding intent of the Council, the result of the actual constitutional documents need not be harmful.\n\nSacred VC2 constitutions make us think about what a constitution is: a multi-author document expressing the sovereign will of multiple ratifiers at a convention\u2014in this case covenantal agents of the people of God. But a constitution\u2019s meaning is not the vector sum of its authors and ratifiers: its meaning is the binding public signification of its words, as originally ratified. If a constitutional term\u2019s meaning popularly changes a decade after ratification, the ten-year-old meaning of the term remains what was ratified (until formally amended). Ratified meaning is time-stamped and time-sealed.\n\nIt is conceivable\u2014as happened at the Second Vatican Council\u2014that a faction of revolutionary authors and ratifiers could embed their revolution within the vaguest clauses of the constitutions as a killswitch to be flipped at a later date. Since the goal of these revolutionaries was heteropraxy and not heterodoxy, little did they care that the (original, public) meaning of their suggestive byplay remained to posterity orthodox, as long as it was received and practiced as the opposite of orthopraxy.\n\nTheir benighted progeny two generations later wish that they had articulated the revolution clearly rather than reifying a protection for traditionalists: live by innuendo, die by innuendo. Even an author does not govern the public meaning of his immortalized and ratified constitutional text if it militates against his intent.\n\nSince the close of the Council in 1965, excluding those who welcomed the progressive interpretation, Catholics have divided into two interpretive groups.\n\nThe first group, the rupturists, conclude that no continuity exists between the periods before and after VC2. They unknowingly employ the intentionalist jurisprudence, based on the radically progressive intent of the Council\u2019s authorial leftists. Even as they bemoan it, this group runs afoul of the indefectibility of the Catholic Church by announcing the end of a bimillennial doctrinal era and the beginning of a new one. They toil on in dimness and in doubt, believing more or less that the Council constitutions ruptured the One True Faith.\n\nThe second group of Catholics (to which I belong) interpreting VC2 concludes that, notwithstanding ostensible tension presented by the Council constitutions, a textualist \u201chermeneutic of continuity\u201d can counter-weaponize the original, public meaning of even the most troubling, vaguely-penned clauses of the constitutions. \u201cLook at the original, public meaning of the constitutions\u2019 words,\u201d we say, \u201cnot the (bad) intents of many of the authors and ratifiers.\u201d\n\nNon-textualists look at VC2 constitutions like Dignitatem Humanae, Lumen Gentium, and Gaudium et Spes, and dejectedly conclude that Roman Catholic indefectibility has been forever broken.\n\nA textualist view of the hermeneutic of continuity duly recognizes ostensible tensions between pre- and post-conciliar Church teaching, then dissolves or collapses that dichotomy by insisting that change cannot be made by mere innuendo: the original, public meaning of the sacred constitutions prevail.\n\nThe ruling on the football field (i.e., pre-conciliar tradition) stands unless sufficient evidence to overrule the call (i.e., explicit Conciliar text) has been clearly presented. Cases of opacity and uncertainty\u2014such as unclear VC2 \u201cupdates\u201d\u2014must be \u201clined out\u201d like an arguable challenge to a play-call that fails to meet sufficient evidence to overturn the standing call (i.e. tradition). [https://americanmind.org/salvo/catholicism-textualism-and-republicanism/]\n\nIn 2016, Francis's Vatican Archbishop Guido Pozzo who was negotiating with Society of Pius X for Francis agreed with the Traditionalists that the Vatican II ambiguous teaching called Dignitatis Humanae was not defined teaching.\n\n\n\nPozzo said that Dignitatis Humanae \"is not about doctrine or definitive statements, but... pastoral practice.\" (Die Zeit, August 2016, Interview with Archbishop Guido Pozzo)\n\n\n\nDr. Edward Feser gives a brief summary of the history before and after Vatican II of the teaching on this subject and the ambiguity of the document:\n\n\n\n\"That depends. In the Catholic context, the traditional teaching, vigorously and repeatedly upheld by the 19 th century and pre-Vatican II 20 th century popes, is that ideally Church and state ought to cooperate. Contrary to an annoyingly common misunderstanding, these popes were not teaching that non-Catholics ought to be coerced by the state into becoming Catholics. Nor were they teaching that non-Catholics should be forbidden from practicing their own religions in the privacy of their own homes, their own church buildings or synagogues, etc. Rather, the issue was whether, in a country in which the vast majority of citizens were Catholic, non-Catholics ought to be permitted to proselytize and thereby possibly lead Catholics to abandon their faith. It was not denied that there can be circumstances in which such proselytizing might be tolerated for the sake of civil order. The question was whether non-Catholics have a strict right in justice to proselytize even in a majority Catholic society. And the pre-Vatican II popes taught that they did not have such a right, and that in a Catholic country the state could in principle justly restrict such proselytizing (even if there are also cases where the state might not exercise its right to such restriction, if this would do more harm than good).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDignitatis Humanae , explicitly taught that it was \u201cleav[ing] untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ.\u201d Yet whether the principles set out in Dignitatis Humanae really can be reconciled with the principles set out by the pre-Vatican II popes, how exactly they are to be reconciled if they can be, and which principles are more authoritative and ought to be retained if they cannot be reconciled -- these have all been matters of controversy. They are controversies most Catholics, including conservative Catholics, have avoided. The reason, it seems to me, is that the older teaching is extremely unpopular in modern times, and thus whatever its current doctrinal status, most Catholics are happy to let it remain a dead letter and leave its precise relationship to Dignitatis Humanae unsettled. Yet a question unanswered and ignored is still a real question, and there are scholars who have in different ways attempted to apply to this one a \u201chermeneutic of continuity,\u201d including \"This was the teaching which Vatican II seemed to reverse, though the relevant document,, explicitly taught that it was \u201cleav[ing] untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ.\u201d Yetthe principles set out inreally can be reconciled with the principles set out by the pre-Vatican II popes,they are to be reconciled if they can be, andprinciples are more authoritative and ought to be retained if they cannot be reconciled -- these have all been matters of controversy.

That such a \"right\" attacks both public morality and the very foundation of Catholic social order (where it exists) hardly needs to be proved. There cannot, obviously, be any \"right\" as such publicly to deny the Divinity of Christ or to preach in favor of contraception, abortion, divorce[, homosexuality] and other evils.

The State might for prudential reasons, as St. Thomas observed, tolerate certain public errors and vices, but there is no question of any right to be tolerated in spreading them.\" [http://www.dailycatholic.org/issue/05Dec/dec14agg.htm and https://www.thecatholicmonitor.com/2021/06/vigano-vatican-iis-dignitatis-humanae.html]\n\nFinally, a Francis is definitely pope enabler seemed to be ambiguous, like Vatican II, a few years ago:\n\nIn 2019, the Wanderer's Fr. Brian Harrison issued a attack on the 19 scholar heroes by first presenting a straw man then showing his argument:\n\n\n\n\"Pope Francis has indeed said some things I believe to be heretical... the heretical doctrine of annihilation... [but] Francis is notorious for frequently speaking 'off the cuff'... [was] he/she accurately reported... [but] supposing... [It's] really heretical opinion... Only if he/she remains stubborn and obstinate can the Church declare him/her to be a formal heretic.\"\n\n(The Wanderer, \"Why I didn't Sign the Open Letter Accusing the Pope of Heresy,\" May 3, 2019)\n\n\n\nIt is strange that Harrison says Francis has only \"said\" some things that may be heretical when he knows Francis wrote the Argentine letter that teaches that those committing adultery can receive Communion which was called \"authentic magisterium\" by the Pope's Vatican and placed in the Holy See's Official Acts of the Apostolic See (AAS).\n\n\n\nThis means the unorthodox interpretation of Communion for those committing adultery is the official teaching of Francis.\n\n\n\nHow might Francis and Harrison have known for a long time this teaching is heretical?\n\n\n\nFirst, they just have to read the Ten Commandments. One happens to say that God commands that: \"Thou shall not commit adultery.\"\n\n\n\nBut, just in case they never heard of the Ten Commandments, way back on December 23, 2016, Dubia Cardinal Walter Brandmuller said:\n\n\n\n\"Whoever thinks that persistent adultery and reception of Holy Communion are compatible is a heretic and promotes schism.\"\n\n(LifeSiteNews, \"Dubia Cardinal: Anyone who Opens Communion to Adulterers is a Heretic and Promotes Schism,\" December 23, 2016)\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Francis made it the official teaching of his papacy that those committing adultery can receive Communion by placing the Argentine letter in the Holy See's AAS.\n\n\n\nHe did this despite the fact that in 2016 Cardinal Brandmuller said Communion for adulterers is heretical and in that same year three other cardinals joined him to issue the Dubia against Communion for adulterers as well as other issues.\n\n\n\nIt has now been now many hundreds of days since the Dubia was issued.\n\n\n\nMany people say Francis never answered the Dubia.\n\n\n\nThey are wrong.\n\n\n\nHe answered the Dubia in 2017 when he made the heretical teaching Communion for adulterers his official teaching by placing the Argentine letter in the Holy See's AAS.\n\n\n\nCould he have been anymore \"obstinate\" in heresy than that Fr. Harrison?\n\n\n\nYou, Fr. Harrison, say the Open Letter is \"disrespectful to the Supreme Pontiff.\"\n\n\n\nLike Paul was disrespectful to the first pope, Peter, when he rebuked him.\n\n\n\nLike the disrespectful Catholics of the Middle Ages:\n\n\n\n\"[T]he Sorbonne's Chancellor, Jean Gerson [even] reached the point of threatening [Pope] John XXII with the stake if he didn't make a retraction\" of his heretical teaching on the Beatific Vision.\n\n(Rotate Caeli, \"Popes who fell into Heresy,\" January 28, 2015)\n\n\n\nThey would not be like you Fr. Harrison in thinking it is \"disrespectful\" to call on the world's bishops to admonish Francis.\n\n\n\nDo you believe that Communion for adulterers it is heretical?\n\n\n\nDo you believe that the Ten Commandments are infallible teachings?\n\nIf you do believe then start acting like St. Paul or the Medieval Chancellor Jean Gerson.\n\nPray an Our Father now for reparation for the sins committed because of Francis\u2019s Amoris Laetitia.",

            "text": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2023, in Washington.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., set off a firestorm of his own making last week as he decided to intervene in Israeli politics by telling Israel to abandon its leader right in the middle of sensitive negotiations with Hamas.\n\nI don\u2019t think Schumer will do that again. He heard from pretty much the world and it\u2019s clear that Schumer is out of touch with Israel or he would have known that telling Israelis what to do is likely to produce the opposite result.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired right back, calling it inappropriate to tell an ally and a democracy when they should hold elections and who they should vote for, especially during a war. Israel is the only democracy within the region which otherwise features everything from monarchies, theocracies, Putin puppets, and terrorist regimes. In fact, 72% in the February Economist/YouGov poll see Israel as an ally and friend, while most Americans (57%) see \u201cPalestine\u201d as an enemy and unfriendly.\n\nSCHUMER CALLS FOR NEW ISRAELI LEADER TO REPLACE NETANYAHU IN SENATE FLOOR SPEECH\n\nAre Schumer and Biden genuinely motivated by the conditions in war-torn Gaza or by the politics of Michigan? There are two million people in Gaza dislocated by the heinous attacks of October 7th and the resulting war to eliminate Hamas. There are 11 million people in Haiti now suddenly thrown into riotous gang rule \u2013 yet not much of a word about them nor boatloads of aid going to them. The answer is obvious \u2013 politics.\n\nSchumer appeared to be looking to throw a bone to the left wing of the party that, for reasons of intersectional identity, now supports a movement that subjugates women and allows honor killings of gays and lesbians.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBy about 82 to 18 Americans support Israel over Hamas in this conflict and nearly two-thirds believe that any ceasefire should occur only after Hamas releases the hostages, according to the latest Harvard CAPS Harris poll. Other polls tend to incorrectly frame the conflict as between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and even framed in this odd way, Americans support Israelis generally by about 3 to 1.\n\nKIRBY DODGES ANSWERING POINT-BLANK IF BIDEN BELIEVES NETANYAHU IMPEDES PEACE: \u2018KNOWN EACH OTHER A LONG TIME\u2019\n\nOf course, Americans support the well-being of the Palestinian people and support aid to those in Gaza. But no one would have framed World War II as whether you supported the British people or the German people. It was about Hitler \u2013 and this conflict is about Hamas, a terrorist group that captured, and is still holding, American citizens among its hostages today.\n\nThe administration agrees Hamas is an evil group but seems to have somehow bought into the idea that Netanyahu is at fault, as though any other country would do something different after an event on the scale of Pearl Harbor, which killed 68 civilians, or 9/11, which killed 3,000 civilians in a country of over 300 million.\n\nSCHUMER TRASHED FOR \u2018DISGUSTING\u2019 SPEECH CALLING ON ISRAEL TO DUMP NETANYAHU: \u2018OUTRAGEOUSLY INAPPROPRIATE\u2019\n\nThe danger in the politics of what Schumer and Biden are doing is that it emboldens Hamas and actually complicates arriving at any kind of peace. If Biden had remained steadfast in his support for Israel and put the blame on Hamas for creating a tunnel city intertwined with civilian life instead of singling out Netanyahu, Hamas would be fearing extinction and would be much more likely to send out the hostages. By blasting the Israeli prime minister for policies supported by the vast majority of Israelis, he is instead signaling to Hamas to hold out and not to worry. Help is on the way. Whether they intended to or not, that is the result of what they have done.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nAnd they are not really helping themselves politically either. The truth is that the electorate is about 2% Jewish and less than 2% Muslim and when asked to name the most important issue, 2% named the Israel-Hamas policy.\n\nIn Michigan, 100,000 votes for uncommitted is a small fraction of the 10 million people there and just how likely are they to help elect Donald Trump? And the more Biden has waffled on Israel, the lower his Israel approval ratings have sunk.\n\nThere is no genocide, no apartheid or anything like it. Jews are a diverse people and of the 9 million Israelis, 20% are Arab and 5% other minorities. In fact, The Economist/You Gov polls show that 58% believe it is Hamas that is committing genocide against the Jews and not Israel.\n\nSchumer put his foot in his mouth in so many ways in attacking Netanyahu. He should stick to commenting on American politics, which is not in great shape right now. And the pressure should be one hundred percent on the leadership of Hamas, which killed Americans and is holding American hostages, to release them now or face extinction.\n\nPlaying domestic politics with the issue will only backfire.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MARK PENN\n\nOriginal article source: Schumer taught Democrats and Biden a powerful lesson\n\nNews Related",

            "text": "The economic toll of inflation rates in the U.S. remains a top issue for voters in the 2024 presidential cycle.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, nearly three-quarters of Americans say strengthening the economy is their top priority, driven by worries about inflation. 72% of adults are very concerned about the price of food and consumer goods and 63% are very worried about the cost of housing.\n\nDespite inflation having fallen by about 6 percent since its high in 2022 and the U.S. enjoying the lowest inflation among countries in the G7, an informal group of advanced economies including Germany, Japan and the U.K.\n\nThe tide might be starting to turn as views on the economy shift: a Suffolk University and USA TODAY poll shows that 33 percent of respondents describe the economy as being in \u201ceconomic recovery,\u201d up from 9 percent less than two years ago.\n\nWith voters so concerned about inflation and the economy, they will likely consider President Joe Biden\u2019s and former President Donald Trump\u2019s inflation-reducing plans when making their decision.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHow does Biden plan to fix inflation?\n\nBiden has touted his Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in August of 2022, but it hasn\u2019t yet curbed prices\u2014which even he admits.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t called it that because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it has to do with providing alternatives that generate economic growth,\u201d the president said in August 2023.\n\nHowever, the law also hasn\u2019t caused prices to increase, and it has the potential to bring down inflation in the future. By 2030, the White House says it will cut electricity rates by as much as 9 percent through tax credits for renewable energy, and lower gas prices by as much as 13 percent through electric vehicle tax credits.\n\nThe law could also bring down inflation through its health care provisions, which include capping monthly insulin prices and out-of-pocket prescription drugs.\n\nBiden has pledged to do more on inflation. In a statement on March 12, he said that his recent budget proposal would lower prescription drug costs, health care, child care, and education costs, rents by building two million homes, and taxes on the wealthy and corporations. However, the proposal is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled House.\n\nMore:Taxing the rich to cut deficit: Five takeaways from President Biden's proposed budget\n\nWhere does Trump stand on fixing inflation?\n\nTrump voters have mentioned inflation and the economy as reasons for voting for the former president. However, according to economists, his agenda includes few inflation-reducing policies.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s plans to curb inflation would be more gas production. He said that America should \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d But America is already drilling: U.S. oil output hit record highs last year.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s plans is to increase tariffs on goods from China by as much as 60 percent or more. But these tariffs wouldn\u2019t just hurt foreign producers; costs could be passed onto the goods themselves, raising prices for consumers.\n\nThe campaign also promises a large-scale deportation of undocumented immigrants. If that plan were implemented, labor shortages would raise prices because of either fewer goods or raised wages.\n\nTrump has also mentioned his intent to deregulate businesses, which could reduce inflation as businesses save costs. But he has not offered any more details on those plans.\n\nOther factors that lower inflation\n\nThe president often gets celebrated when the economy is doing well, and blamed when it\u2019s doing poorly. But the reality is that the administration usually has little control over how the economy performs.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s not just the White House that controls inflation; in reality, the Federal Reserve is the agency mainly responsible, and makes decisions independent of the president. To keep inflation low, the Fed\u2019s principal tool is raising interest rates. However, higher interest rates can make home ownership more expensive.\n\nOil and gas prices have a significant impact on inflation. Recently, their rise and fall have been tied to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In general, oil prices are driven by global events rather than U.S. domestic policy.\n\nThe pandemic is also to blame. Supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic increased shipping costs, which in turn increased the prices of goods. As those kinks have been worked out recently, prices have fallen.\n\nInflation is receding: while not yet at the 2% recommended by the Federal Reserve, it\u2019s at 3.1 percent right now\u2014much lower than 9.1 percent in 2022.\n\nYet, high prices remain fresh in voters\u2019 minds, and both Biden and Trump will likely want to prove themselves the best candidates for the job.",

Smith is prosecuting Trump in two separate federal cases, one involving Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and one involving his alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Both cases are still ongoing.\n\nTrump still faces charges in classified documents, election interference cases\n\nThe federal judges responsible have not brought an end to the two criminal cases brought against Trump as a result of Smith's investigations.\n\nTrump faces 40 counts in the classified documents case, including charges of obstructing justice, making false statements and trying to \"alter, destroy, mutilate or conceal evidence.\" More than 300 classified documents were recovered from Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, over a year after he left the White House\n\nJudge Eileen Cannon is expected to postpone a May 20 trial date because of disputes in the case, and she has said it will probably be later than the prosecution's proposal of July 8. Trump\u2019s lawyers suggested Aug. 12, but also urged Cannon to postpone the trial until after the November election.\n\nFact check: Biden had nothing to do with Trump's indictment in classified documents probe\n\nTrump faces another four counts in the election interference case \u2013 three for conspiracy and one for obstruction. He is accused of falsely claiming election fraud and trying to overturn the legitimate 2020 election results.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan canceled a March 4 trial date as higher courts weigh Trump's claim that a former president is immune from prosecution for official acts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal and scheduled arguments for the week of April 22.\n\nIn the first comment, the social media user who made the post shared a link to an article published in January about Chutkan barring Smith from filing pretrial motions without permission as Trump's immunity claim is decided.

A convicted felon, who served jail time.

I said just keep talking, you'll be there soon.\"\n\n\"I look forward to that, Mr. Parnas,\" Bobulinski responded.\n\n\"Keep lying, you'll be there soon,\" Parnas hit back.\n\nBobulinski then asked if that was \"a threat,\" to which Parnas answered, \"No, it's just the truth.\"\n\n\"Did you say they were coming for me?\" Bobulinski asked.\n\n\"No, I said if you keep lying, you will end up in prison,\" Parnas responded.\n\n\"I'm not lying.

(Laughter.)\n\nRussell and Dori, thank you for your friendship. You know, you heas- \u2014 you hosted me the first time for a fundraiser in 2019. And it\u2019s fitting that you\u2019re hosting my first Texas fundraiser for 2024.\n\nA special thanks to all of you: Jaime Harrison and \u2014 the chair of the \u2014 of the \u2014 our \u2014 our party; Chris, our finance chair; and all the lawyers here today who care deeply about the rule of law and the frontlines of fairness and justice and \u2014 and deepening democracy and defending it, because I think it\u2019s at stake.\n\nYou know, folks, we\u2019re seeing incredible enthusiasm all over the country as we travel. Recently, I\u2019ve traveled to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Nevada, Arizona. And Jill and Kamala and Doug are traveling as well.\n\nOur grassroots support, thank God, keeps getting stronger. So far, over 1.3 million people have contributed to our campaign this time around \u2014 500,000 of them, brand new \u2014 and 97 percent of those contributions are $200 or less \u2014 97 percent of them.\n\nAnd we\u2019re ramping up our many campaign headquarters, off- \u2014 field offices across the country. We\u2019ve opened a hundred field offices so far and staffing them all now \u2014 and before Trump has opened a \u2014 and his MAGA Republican friends \u2014 have opened even one. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd while you probably haven\u2019t read about it, in the last few days, there have been five national polls where we\u2019re back to leading again in the polls. (Applause.)\n\nBut the truth is I\u2019m not sure any of them matter, because it\u2019s so hard to take polls these days. It really is. And not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm. Not everyone.\n\nJust the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, I need your help. I\u2019m being crushed with debt. I\u2019m completely wiped out.\u201d I had to say, \u201cDonald, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) (Inaudible.)\n\nSpeaking of Donald Trump, just a few days ago, he asked a famous question in one of his rallies: Are you better off today than you were four years ago?\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question, man. (Laughter.) I hope everyone in the country takes a moment to think back what it was like in March of 2020.\n\nCOVID had come to America. Trump was president. Hospitals, emergency rooms were overcrowded. First responders were risking their lives. Nurses were wear- \u2014 were wear- \u2014 were wearing garbage bags because they couldn\u2019t have the protection in the hospitals they needed. There was a ventilator shortage. Morgues were being set up all outside, not just in the hospitals. And the loved ones were dying all alone. We couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to them.\n\nAnd unemployment shot up to 14 percent. The stock market crashed. Grocery store shelves were emply \u2014 and were empty. And we even \u2014 remember the whole toilet paper conference? (Laughter.) No, I\u2019m \u2014 think about how tough things were.\n\nYou know, months ago Trump tried to downplay the virus. He told us, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it will go away. Just stay calm. And we\u2019ll\u201d \u2014 remember he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be out of it by Easter\u201d? Well, over a million people died. And while \u2014 all while doing nothing.\n\nOf course, we now know Bob Woodward\u2019s book \u2014 that Trump was lying to the American people all along. He knew how dangerous the virus was, and he hid it from us. He just kept getting worse \u2014 worse and worse. He told Americans \u2014 remember he was telling \u201cinject bleach\u201d? He told us to hit the body with UV light. Well \u2014 (laughter).\n\nBut later, you know, he wanted to tear gas the photo op \u2014 for a photo op, out \u2014 because they protested justice in front of the White House.\n\nThen, after losing the 2020 election, Trump finished his presidency by sending an interrecti- \u2014 an insurrection mob to the Capitol. And, folks, look, there\u2019s \u2014 these folks \u2014 so many of them have been convicted. And he swears when he gets elected he\u2019s going to pardon them all \u2014 pardon them all \u2014 because they\u2019re \u201cheroes.\u201d\n\nBut four years later, look at where we \u2014 how far we\u2019ve come. Donald Trump is not president \u2014 that\u2019s the first thing \u2014 because of you. (Applause.) And I mean it \u2014 because of many of you.\n\nCOVID no longer controls our lives. We\u2019ve created 15 million new jobs \u2014 more jobs in that timeframe than any president has in American history. (Applause.) We have the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. We had record economic growth, new small-business creation record, stock market is highest it\u2019s ever been.\n\nInsulin now costs seniors 35 bucks instead of 400 bucks a month. Out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs for seniors are going to be capped at $2,000 a year, no matter what the total cost is.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t just save seniors money; it saves taxpayers significant amounts of money.\n\nBy just passing that law and what we\u2019ve done so far, we\u2019ve saved \u2014 we\u2019ve reduced the deficit by $160 billion \u2014 $160 billion. If you\u2019re not paying $400 instead of $15, and so on. Go down the line. I won\u2019t bore you with detail.\n\nWe\u2019re rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads and bridges. We\u2019re delivering clean water and high-speed Internet to every American, whether you\u2019re rural or no matter where you live.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is booming \u2014 800,000 manufacturing jobs and counting. And be- \u2014 you all know this as well as I do: We\u2019ve attracted over $650 billion dollars in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors \u2014 all across America. (Applause.) We made the biggest investment in history to combat climate change. And we can do a lot more, of course, and we have to.\n\nInflation peaked at 9 percent a little over a couple of years ago \u2014 a year and a half ago. Now, it\u2019s dropped to 3 percent \u2014 the lowest in the world \u2014 and still dropping. We\u2019re going to do more \u2014 more to be done.\n\nSo, let me ask you: Does anyone here want to go back to 2020? (Laughs.)\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, when fear ruled our lives, when Trump was president \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.\n\nBut, look, the problem isn\u2019t just going back to Trump ha- \u2014 where Trump had the country. The problem is he wants to take us \u2014 where he wants to take us now. Look at what he\u2019s saying, and I hope that we all begin to take seriously. He means what he says. As crazy as it sounds, he means what he says.\n\nHe wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Over 30 million Americans depend on the ACA. It would be a disaster for the \u2014 to be taken away.\n\nHe wants to get rid of the savings I just got put into law for prescription drugs at 35 bucks for \u2014 for insulin \u2014 for a whole range of \u2014 and he just wants to wipe it all out.\n\nYou know, and what he wants to do is enact another $2 trillion tax cut. Well, at the time, you know, he increased the deficit larger than any man in American history in four years \u2014 the deficit.\n\nHouse Republicans just proposed massive cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Trump recently said, \u201cSocial security and Medicare \u2014 there\u2019s a lot you can do to cut more.\u201d\n\nWell, folks, the climate \u2014 he\u2019s a climate denier. And he\u2019s going to do away with the historic action that we\u2019ve taken. There\u2019s a lot more to do. I\u2019m not suggesting we\u2019ve finished.\n\nBut another school shooting recently, and what did he say? He said \u2014 when asked about it, he said, \u201cJust get over it.\u201d \u201cJust get over it.\u201d\n\nNo \u2014 no, I want to stop it, not get over it. The idea our children are having to duck and cover in school. Did you ever think we\u2019d be in that position? Ever think we\u2019d be teaching kids that?\n\nLook \u2014 look at the judges he put on the bench. Imagine who else he\u2019ll put on the bench.\n\nOur reputation internationally has been crushed when he was president. Imagine what will happen if he\u2019s reelected. He wants to do away with NATO, and he wants to tell Putin to do whatever you want \u2014 do whatever you want.\n\nTrump boasts he \u2014 what I found so stunning: He recently hosted Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Prime Minister of Hungary, at Mar-a-Lago. And Orb\u00e1n says he doesn\u2019t think democracy works \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work. And that\u2019s who he admires most.\n\nHe brags about how he ha- \u2014 he\u2019s the reason Roe v. Wade is overturned and the freedom to choose is taken away. Look, and American needs to know: Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists are now calling for a national ban \u2014 a national ban on abortion in every state in the Union.\n\nFolks, one more thing. Trump didn\u2019t just bring chaos to the lives of women. He is also bringing chaos to the American border.\n\nWith a group of bipartisan senators we put together over a five-month period, the very conservative \u2014 a very conservative senator from Oklahoma heading the group \u2014 of a meeting for five \u2014 five solid weeks toward the end, we agreed on the strongest border security law in American history: 1,500 more Border Security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve six \u2014 issues in six months instead of, now, six years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly decrease the ability to \u2014 to smuggle in fentanyl and all its precursors.\n\nBut Trump \u2014 the problem is \u2014 I\u2019ve been around a while. I don\u2019t ever remember the leader of another party saying the reason they want to \u2014 their party to vote against something \u2014 not because it wasn\u2019t good but because he worried I would get too much credit for it \u2014 the other team would get credit for it.\n\nFolks, it wasn\u2019t about whether it\u2019s good for me or Trump; it\u2019s about what\u2019s good for America.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I \u2014 here\u2019s what I will not do. Unlike Trump, I\u2019m not going to demonize immigrants. I will not say immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of this nation. I will not call immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers.\u201d I will not separate families, put kids in cages. I\u2019ll not end the birthright citizenship.\n\nNow, this guy actually wants to end \u2014 and he\u2019s \u2014 now he\u2019s bragging about it. He wants to end the right for birthright citizenship, which we established way back, a couple hundred years ago. If you\u2019re born in America, you\u2019re an American citizen. He wants to end that.\n\nI\u2019m not going to ban people because of religion. That\u2019s not who we are as Americans.\n\nFolks, but after all the threats Trump poses, to our economy, our standing in the world, is \u2014 the greatest threat he poses is to our democracy. Violence on January 6th \u2014 Trump embraced and he\u2019s running on it. He\u2019s running on it. He calls insurrectionists who are in prison \u2014 in prison \u2014 found guilty and in prison \u2014 he calls them \u201cpatriots.\u201d He suggests that they are, in fact, the ones who should be \u2014 and he swears if he gets elected, he\u2019s going to pardon them \u2014 pardon them all.\n\nTrump now says if he loses again in November, there will be a \u201cbloodbath\u201d in the streets.\n\nYou know, we didn\u2019t \u2014 when I got elected, and you helped me get elected in 2020, I \u2014 I made a speech on democracy at Independence Hall. I said we\u2019re in danger of losing the democracy if we don\u2019t win this thing. Well, folks, we can\u2019t stand for this stuff. We have to say in one voice as Americans \u2014 as Democrats, independents, and Republicans \u2014 there\u2019s no place for violence in America ever, ever, ever. Period. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I\u2019ll probably get her in trouble, but I just read what Liz Cheney recently said. She said, \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly vote for him, because democracy is at stake.\u201d And when asked, she said she\u2019d vote for Biden. The idea that a woman who is \u2014 has very different id- \u2014 ideas on policy than I do is so concerned that this guy gets reelected \u2014 what will happen.\n\nLook, let me close with this, because you\u2019re standing. You know, I couldn\u2019t be \u2014 the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher across the board. And with your help, we\u2019re going to win up and down the ticket. That includes here in Texas, because I want to see \u2014 you got to elect Colin your next senator. (Applause.) You got to so Ted Cruz joins another loser, Donald Trump. (Laughter.)\n\nLooks, there\u2019s a lot of focus these days on how old Trump is and how old I am. I\u2019m two \u2014 two times 40. But I \u2014 you know, what the hell? (Laughter.)\n\nThe real question is \u2014 all kidding aside \u2014 is how old are ideas? How old are our ideas?\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s vision of America is one of anger, hate revenge, retribution \u2014 some of the oldest known ideas to man.\n\nI have a very different vision for America, one that focuses on the future and answers questions \u2014 important questions: Are you better off now, and will you be better off four years from now?\n\nHere\u2019s the future I see, and I\u2019ll be brief. I see a future where we defend democracy and we don\u2019t diminish it.\n\nI see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect the freedoms, not take them away.\n\nI see a future \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy, the su- \u2014 you know, we have a thousand billionaires. I \u2014 I respect anybody who can make as much money as they can legally. But you know what their average tax \u2014 you know what the tax is of a \u2014 for those thousand billionaires in America? 8.2 percent. Anybody want to trade that rate? (Laughter.)\n\nNo \u2014 no, but I\u2019m serious. This \u2014 this is \u2014 you know, if \u2013 if they just got paid \u2014 if they just paid the 25 percent, do you know how much money that would raise? Four hundred billion dollars over 10 years.\n\nImagine what we could do \u2014 from everything from the deficit to taking care of kids, education, so many \u2014\n\nI see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.\n\nLook, I own weapons. I own guns. But this \u2014 from the very beginning, the Second Amendment didn\u2019t say you can own any weapon. You couldn\u2019t own a cannon. You couldn\u2019t own a \u2014 I\u2019m serious.\n\nAnd so, above all, I really do \u2014 I give you my word \u2014 I see a future for all Americans where we don\u2019t demonize one another and we give hate no safe harbor and we leave nobody behind. That\u2019s a future we can build together. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about our future.\n\nMy dad used to have an expression, God love him. My dad was a high school-educated guy who was well-read. He got into Johns Hopkins. But during the war, he never made it to Hopkins.\n\nMy dad used to say, \u201cJoey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about respect. It\u2019s about having a chance. It\u2019s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \u2018Honey, it\u2019s going to be okay,\u2019 and mean it.\u201d Well, that\u2019s what this is about: giving everybody a shot.\n\nWe are the most incredible nation in the world. I know that sounds like I\u2019m bragging about our country, but I am. I think it\u2019s real. We\u2019re the only nation in the world, as I said before, that have come \u2014 come out of every crisis we faced stronger than we went in \u2014 stronger than when we went in.\n\nWe have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. And I believe with all my \u2014 every fiber of my being there\u2019s not a single thing beyond our capacity to get done when we act together. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.\n\nSo, God bless you all. Thanks for giving me a shot to do it again. And may God protect our troops. (Applause.) Thank you.\n\nEvery time I\u2019d walk out of my Grandfathers Finnegan\u2019s house in Scranton he\u2019d yell, \u201cJoey, keep the faith.\u201d And my grandmother would yell, \u201cNo, Joey. Spread it.\u201d Let\u2019s go spread it.\n\nThank you. (Applause.)\n\n7:39 P.M. CDT",

            "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nThe Biden campaign took a victory lap on Wednesday over its major fundraising and cash advantage compared to the Trump campaign.\n\nElection filings made public on Wednesday showed Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign brought in $10.9 million last month, while his joint fundraising committee raised nearly $11 million. His operation overall had about $42 million in cash on hand entering March.\n\nThose figured lagged far behind the Biden campaign operation, which raised roughly $53 million in February, giving it $155 million in cash on hand entering March.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump put up these kinds of numbers on The Apprentice, he\u2019d fire himself,\u201d Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. \u201cBut here\u2019s why he ain\u2019t got it: his extreme, toxic agenda of banning abortion, slashing Social Security, and promoting political violence is repelling donors and doing exactly *nothing* to earn support from the voters who will decide this election.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if he had the money, it\u2019s not a message the voters would buy,\u201d Tyler added.\n\nAmmar Moussa, another Biden campaign spokesperson, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, \u201cI\u2019m not a mathematician but I think we have A LOT more cash.\u201d\n\nTrump, who became the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee earlier this month, could see a fundraising boost as he merges his operations with the Republican National Committee. The RNC reported Wednesday it had about $11 million in cash on hand at the end of February, trailing the Democratic National Committee\u2019s $26 million cash on hand.\n\n2024 Election Coverage\n\nFurther compounding Trump\u2019s problems, the former president has been burning through cash to pay his legal fees as he faces four separate criminal trials. He is also facing a looming deadline to pay a $454 million judgment after a New York judge determined he conspired to inflate his assets for tax and insurance benefits and was liable for fraud.\n\nWith interest piling on an additional $112,000 each day Trump doesn\u2019t pay, the former president owes the state about $457 million as of Wednesday.\n\nBiden on Thursday will wrap up a three-day trip to Nevada, Arizona and Texas, which included three fundraisers. He will attend a major fundraiser in New York City next week alongside former President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton.",

            "text": "The U.S. Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the U.S. government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.\n\nThe complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that \u201dApple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,\u201d he added.\n\nThe long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling \u2013 and in some cases, restricting \u2013 how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth\u2019s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.\n\nThe company said it denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d\n\nBut Garland on Thursday said Apple\u2019s actions have wide-ranging effects.\n\n\u201cMonopolies like Apple\u2019s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,\u201d Garland said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there\u2019s a law for that,\u201d he added.\n\nFor example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message \u2013 but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.\n\nThe company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors\u2019 products are far more limited in their capabilities.\n\n\u201cApple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,\u201d Garland said on Thursday.\n\n\u2018We will vigorously defend against it\u2019\n\nThis year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.\n\nAnd Apple maintains a 30 per cent commission on most sales through its app store \u2013 a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple\u2019s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\n\nThursday\u2019s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.\n\nApple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2013 designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\u201d the company said in its statement. \u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\u201d\n\nYears of scrutiny\n\nApple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple\u2019s practices.\n\nThe case represents the Biden administration\u2019s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under U.S. antitrust law.\n\nApple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.\n\nThe legal action could weigh on Apple\u2019s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell 3 per cent Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.\n\nAlong with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.\n\nThe Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden\u2019s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.\n\nAlong with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.\n\nApps vs Apple\n\nTo solve Android phone customers\u2019 \u201cgreen bubble\u201d issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.\n\n\u201cIt lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,\u201d Migicovsky said. \u201cTechnologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.\u201d\n\nThose kind of interactions have made Apple\u2019s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.\n\nBeginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game \u201cFortnite.\u201d\n\nApple isn\u2019t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.\n\nThose rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don\u2019t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.\n\nEurope\u2019s bite at Apple\n\nThe U.S. government isn\u2019t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.\n\nIn a seismic move to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.\n\nBut critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.\n\nUpstart turned behemoth\n\nSince its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It\u2019s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple\u2019s restrictiveness.\n\nIn the era led by founder Steve Jobs, \u201cApple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,\u201d said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. \u201cApple relentlessly innovated. They were always steps ahead of the competition.\u201d\n\nNow, however, Apple\u2019s advances are more \u201cincremental\u201d than earth-shattering, Bailey added. \u201c[CEO Tim] Cook has been focused on financial management and expanding market share.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s financially healthy,\u201d Bailey said, but their reputation for innovation is \u201cdimming.\u201d",

But we\u2019re increasingly convinced that we\u2019re worse off than our parents were, that the planet is in crisis, and that it\u2019s probably not worth having kids.\n\nI\u2019ll generalize here about my own cohort (people born after 1981 but before 2010), commonly referred to as Millennials and Gen Z, as that shorthand corresponds to survey and demographic data. Millennials and Gen Z have valid economic complaints, and the conditions of our young adulthood perceptibly weakened traditional bridges to economic independence. We graduated with record amounts of student debt after President Obama nationalized that lending. Housing prices doubled during our household formation years due to zoning impediments and chronic underbuilding. Young Americans say economic issues are important to us, and candidates are courting our votes by promising student debt relief and cheaper housing (which they will never be able to deliver).\n\nYoung people, in our idealism and our rational ignorance of the actual appropriations process, typically support more government intervention, more spending programs, and more of every other burden that has landed us in such untenable economic circumstances to begin with. Perhaps not coincidentally, young people who\u2019ve spent the most years in the increasingly partisan bubble of higher education are also the most likely to favor expanded government programs as a \u201csolution\u201d to those complaints.\n\nIt\u2019s Your Debt, Boomer\n\nWhat most young people don\u2019t yet understand is that we are sacrificing our young adulthood and our financial security to pay for debts run up by Baby Boomers. Part of every Millennial and Gen-Z paycheck is payable to people the same age as the members of Congress currently milking this system and miring us further in debt.\n\nOur government spends more than it can extract from taxpayers. Social Security, which represents 20 percent of government spending, has run an annual deficit for 15 years. Last year Social Security alone overspent by $22.1 billion. To keep sending out checks to retirees, Social Security goes begging to the Treasury Department, and the Treasury borrows from the public by issuing bonds. Bonds allow investors (who are often also taxpayers) to pay for some retirees\u2019 benefits now, and be paid back later. But investors only volunteer to lend Social Security the money it needs to cover its bills because the (younger) taxpayers will eventually repay the debt \u2014 with interest.\n\nIn other words, both Social Security and Medicare, along with various smaller federal entitlement programs, together comprising almost half of the federal budget, have been operating for a decade on the principle of \u201cgive us the money now, and stick the next generation with the check.\u201d We saddle future generations with debt for present-day consumption.\n\nThe second largest item in the budget after Social Security is interest on the national debt \u2014 largely on Social Security and other entitlements that have already been spent. These mandatory benefits now consume three quarters of the federal budget: even Congress is not answerable for these programs. We never had the chance for our votes to impact that spending (not that older generations were much better represented) and it\u2019s unclear if we ever will.\n\nYoung Americans probably don\u2019t think much about the budget deficit (each year\u2019s overspending) or the national debt (many years\u2019 deficits put together, plus interest) much at all. And why should we? For our entire political memory, the federal government, as well as most of our state governments, have been steadily piling \u201cpublic\u201d debt upon our individual and collective heads. That\u2019s just how it is. We are the frogs trying to make our way in the watery world as the temperature ticks imperceptibly higher. We have been swimming in debt forever, unaware that we\u2019re being economically boiled alive.\n\nMillennials have somewhat modest non-mortgage debt of around $27,000 (some self-reports say twice that much), including car notes, student loans, and credit cards. But we each owe more than $100,000 as a share of the national debt. And we don\u2019t even know it.\n\nWhen Millennials finally do have babies (and we are!) that infant born in 2024 will enter the world with a newly minted Social Security Number and $78,089 credit card bill for Granddad\u2019s heart surgery and the interest on a benefit check that was mailed when her parents were in middle school.\n\nHeadlines and comments sections love to sneer at \u201csnowflakes\u201d who\u2019ve just hit the \u201creal world,\u201d and can\u2019t figure out how to make ends meet, but the kids are onto something. A full 15 percent of our earnings are confiscated to pay into retirement and healthcare programs that will be insolvent by the time we\u2019re old enough to enjoy them. The Federal Reserve and government debt are eating the economy. The same interest rates that are pushing mortgages out of reach are driving up the cost of interest to maintain the debt going forward. As we learn to save and invest, our dollars are slowly devalued. We\u2019re right to feel trapped.\n\nSure, if we\u2019re alive and own a smartphone, we\u2019re among the one percent of the wealthiest humans who\u2019ve ever lived. Older generations could argue (persuasively!) that we have no idea what \u201cpoverty\u201d is anymore. But with the state of government spending and debt\u2026we are likely to find out.\n\nDespite being richer than Rockefeller, Millennials are right to say that the previous ways of building income security have been pushed out of reach. Our earning years are subsidizing not our own economic coming-of-age, but bank bailouts, wars abroad, and retirement and medical benefits for people who navigated a less-challenging wealth-building landscape.\n\nRedistribution goes both ways. Boomers are expected to pass on tens of trillions in unprecedented wealth to their children (if it isn\u2019t eaten up by medical costs, despite heavy federal subsidies) and older generations\u2019 financial support of the younger has had palpable lifting effects. Half of college costs are paid by families, and the trope of young people moving back home is only possible if mom and dad have the spare room and groceries to make that feasible.\n\nGovernment \u201chelp\u201d during COVID-19 resulted in the worst inflation in 40 years, as the federal government spent $42,000 per citizen on \u201cstimulus\u201d efforts, right around a Millennial\u2019s average salary at that time. An absurd amount of fraud was perpetrated in the stimulus to save an economy from the lockdown that nearly ruined it. Trillions in earmarked goodies were rubber stamped, carelessly added to young people\u2019s growing bill. Government lenders deliberately removed fraud controls, fearing they couldn\u2019t hand out $800 billion in young people\u2019s future wages away fast enough. Important lessons were taught by those programs. The importance of self-sufficiency and the dignity of hard work weren\u2019t top of the list.\n\nBoomer Benefits are Stagnating Hiring, Wages, and Investment for Young People\n\nEven if our workplace engagement suffered under government distortions, Millennials continue to work more hours than other generations and invest in side hustles and self employment at higher rates. Working hard and winning higher wages almost doesn\u2019t matter, though, when our purchasing power is eaten from the other side. Buying power has dropped 20 percent in just five years. Life is $11,400/year more expensive than it was two years ago and deficit spending is the reason why.\n\nWe\u2019re having trouble getting hired for what we\u2019re worth, because it costs employers 30 percent more than just our wages to employ us. The federal tax code both requires and incentivizes our employers to transfer a bunch of what we earned directly to insurance companies and those same Boomer-busted federal benefits, via tax-deductible benefits and payroll taxes. And the regulatory compliance costs of ravenous bureaucratic state. The price paid by each employer to keep each employee continues to rise \u2014 but Congress says your boss has to give most of the increase to someone other than you.\n\nFederal spending programs that many people consider good government, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance for children (CHIP) aren\u2019t a small amount of the federal budget. Government spends on these programs because people support and demand them, and because cutting those benefits would be a re-election death sentence. That\u2019s why they call cutting Social Security the \u201cthird rail of politics.\u201d If you touch those benefits, you die. Congress is held hostage by Baby Boomers who are running up the bill with no sign of slowing down.\n\nYoung people generally support Social Security and the public health insurance programs, even though a 2021 poll by Nationwide Financial found 47 percent of Millennials agree with the statement \u201cI will not get a dime of the Social Security benefits I have earned.\u201d\n\nIn the same survey, Millennials were the most likely of any generation to believe that Social Security benefits should be enough to live on as a sole income, and guessed the retirement age was 52 (it\u2019s 67 for anyone born after 1959 \u2014 and that\u2019s likely to rise). Young people are the most likely to see government guarantees as a valid way to live \u2014 even though we seem to understand that those promises aren\u2019t guarantees at all.\n\nHealthcare costs tied to an aging population and wonderful-but-expensive growth in medical technologies and medications will balloon over the next few years, and so will the deficits in Boomer benefit programs. Newly developed obesity drugs alone are expected to add $13.6 billion to Medicare spending. By 2030, every single Baby Boomer will be 65, eligible for publicly funded healthcare.\n\nThe first Millennial will be eligible to claim Medicare (assuming the program exists and the qualifying age is still 65, both of which are improbable) in 2046. As it happens, that\u2019s also the year that the Boomer benefits programs (which will then be bloated with Gen Xers) and the interest payments we\u2019re incurring to provide those benefits now, are projected to consume 100 percent of federal tax revenue.\n\nGovernment spending is being transferred to bureaucrats and then to the beneficiaries of government spending who are, in some sense, your diabetic grandma who needs a Medicare-paid dialysis treatment, but in a much more immediate sense, are the insurance companies, pharma giants, and hospital corporations who wrote the healthcare legislation. Some percentage of every college graduate\u2019s paycheck buys bullets that get fired at nothing and inflating the private investment portfolios of government contractors, with dubious, wasteful outcomes from the prison-industrial complex to the perpetual war machine.\n\nNo bank or nation in the world can lend the kind of money the American government needs to borrow to fulfill its obligations to citizens. Someone will have to bite the bullet. Even some of the co-authors of the current disaster are wrestling with the truth.\n\nForget avocado toast and streaming subscriptions. We\u2019re already sensing it, but we haven\u2019t yet seen it. Young people are not well-informed, and often actively misled, about what\u2019s rotten in this economic system. But we are seeing the consequences on store shelves and mortgage contracts and we can sense disaster is coming. We\u2019re about to get stuck with the bill.",

But so did many Democrats \u2014 32% agreed to 48% who didn\u2019t.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, voters said they believe Biden is playing a key role in driving the investigations of his rival. Some 58% said Biden has a role. Of that, 40% called his role \u201cmajor.\u201d\n\nThe former president faces dozens of charges in several cases as he enters the heat of the 2024 election. He has often decried the Biden effort as something Third World dictators try. One Trump insider also compared what Biden\u2019s Justice Department is doing to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign against his foes.\n\nThe Trump pollster also asked voters if Biden should pull his prosecutors back and let the election play out. Voters, by an even bigger margin, said they would applaud such a move, 58% to 34%.\n\nPollsters John and Jim McLaughlin\u2019s latest survey showed that despite the punishing criminal and civil cases facing Trump, the Republican has expanded his lead over Biden in the last month.\n\nTrump now leads nationally at 49% to 43%, up from 47% to 43% last month.\n\nIn addition to feeling that Biden is persecuting his foe, voters also feel that \u201cBidenomics\u201d is sinking them. A majority of voters said they are struggling under inflation, and 83% said the president\u2019s economic program has \u201cimpacted\u201d them.\n\nIn national polls, Trump has generally held a lead and one far bigger than he did in any 2020 or 2016 survey. More importantly than the national popular vote, he has also started to expand his leads in battleground states that will determine the Electoral College outcome.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nOn Wednesday, for example, two more polls showed that Trump has a lead over Biden in Arizona and Nevada. Both are from an Emerson College Polling/Hill survey.\n\nIn Arizona, Trump leads Biden 48% to 44%.

            "text": "Four years after the Covid pandemic sent America into a standstill, President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is looking to co-opt a common question posed by former President Donald Trump and his allies: \u201cAre you better off than you were four years ago?\u201d\n\nTrump asked his 6.7 million followers on Truth Social that question earlier this week, using it to drive contrasts between Biden and Trump\u2019s records on the economy and the border. But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time, and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the crisis.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, \u2018Are you better off today than you were yesterday?\u2019 Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and his allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

            "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Democratic Party has ramped up its attacks on independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in recent days, marking the first significant attempt by either party to shape voter sentiment around his candidacy ahead of a potential rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has taken multiple steps in recent days to portray Kennedy as a spoiler who would help Republican frontrunner Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden, arguing Kennedy is funded primarily by wealthy donors aligned with the former president.\n\nLast week, the DNC filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Kennedy\u2019s campaign had illegally coordinated with American Values 2024, a PAC backing his White House bid. Kennedy\u2019s campaign has denied coordinating with the group.\n\nIn a call with reporters outlining the complaint, DNC adviser Ramsey Reid blamed Trump and his donors for turning Kennedy into a \u201cstalking horse\u201d by funding the PAC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that Donald Trump is disrespecting the democratic process. It\u2019s pretty clear that Trump and his megadonors are propping up RFK Jr. as a stalking horse,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe DNC has homed in on donations to the PAC from billionaire Tim Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking fortune who has been a prolific donor to pro-Trump and other GOP causes over the years. Mellon gave approximately $15 million to American Values 2024 last year. In 2020, he gave $20 million to America First Action Inc., one of the leading outside groups backing Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nOn Saturday, as Kennedy held a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the DNC advertised on four billboards around the area accusing Kennedy of being \u201cpowered by MAGA/Trump.\u201d And after the Kennedy-aligned PAC released a new TV ad during the Super Bowl that repurposed an old spot from the 1960 campaign of President John F. Kennedy, the candidate\u2019s uncle, the DNC issued a statement highlighting the PAC\u2019s funding from Mellon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump\u2019s largest donor this cycle,\u201d DNC rapid response director Alex Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the ad aired Sunday.\n\nKennedy\u2019s team pushed back on the Democratic attacks, saying that donors \u201cfrom across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,\u201d Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDNC adviser Lis Smith told CNN the party\u2019s latest efforts are meant to educate voters on the connections between Trump and Kennedy, while acknowledging the critical role Kennedy could play in the general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Donald Trump and his allies view him as a useful stalking horse who could help throw the election to Trump in November,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile his independent campaign faces steep odds of success, Kennedy\u2019s candidacy could influence the outcome of a Biden-Trump rematch if he garners enough support in critical states. In the 2020 election, Biden flipped three states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin \u2013 by margins of less than 1%. Recent national polling of a Trump-Biden rematch suggests the race could be narrowly decided again. A CNN/SSRS poll released earlier this month showed Trump with 49% support among registered voters, compared with 45% for Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear as of now how Kennedy would affect a potential general election between Biden and Trump \u2013 whether he\u2019d draw more support from historically Republican or Democratic voters, or whether he\u2019d receive enough total support to influence the election either way. An NBC News poll released this month found 34% of registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s allies have targeted Biden and Democrats as they look to gain traction in the race, a sign they\u2019re ready to meet the DNC\u2019s escalating attacks straight ahead. In a statement released after the Super Bowl ad, American Values 2024 co-founder Mark Gorton criticized the DNC for its efforts targeting Kennedy.\n\n\u201cThe only argument the DNC has left is that Biden is not Trump. When RFK Jr. gets on the ballot, the American public will have the ability to choose a candidate who is not Trump, who has integrity, bravery, a proven track record of fighting corporate corruption, and the ability to stand up to the corporate interests that have taken over the Biden administration. The American people are waking up, and the DNC\u2019s only hope is to prevent them from having a choice,\u201d Gorton said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and David Wright contributed to this report.",

When he introduced his presidential run in 2015, he pledged to self-finance his marketing campaign and crowed, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s cash.\u201d President Biden\u2019s reelection marketing campaign reported Wednesday that it has $71 million in money available \u2014 greater than double the $33.5 million that Trump\u2019s marketing campaign reported having. In case you throw within the financial institution balances of affiliated teams supporting the candidates, Trump\u2019s marketing campaign liquidity rises to $42 million \u2014 however Biden\u2019s soars to a surprising $155 million, a ridiculous quantity for this level within the cycle.\n\nIt makes me marvel about all these tales telling us how unenthusiastic Democrats are about Biden\u2019s reelection. I\u2019m beginning to assume that possibly \u2014 hear me out \u2014 we must always pay much less consideration to what folks say and extra to what they really do.\n\nThe Republican Nationwide Committee is in no place to bail the Trump marketing campaign out. It reported elevating $10.7 million in February, ending the month with $11.3 million within the financial institution.

His attorneys informed a New York court docket this week that the previous president has been unable to safe a bond that may give him time to enchantment a $454 million judgment in opposition to him and his firm for fraud.\n\nTrump approached greater than 30 corporations about underwriting the bond, his attorneys mentioned, however all refused to simply accept actual property as collateral \u2014 and actual property is the supply of most of Trump\u2019s wealth. The insurance coverage agency Chubb did underwrite a $91 million bond for Trump to enchantment a separate civil judgment (for defaming author E. Jean Carroll) however determined to avoid the fraud case.\n\nNew York Lawyer Normal Letitia James might theoretically start seizing Trump\u2019s property as quickly as subsequent week if he\u2019s unable to safe and put up a bond. It will absolutely be galling for Trump to lose his gaudy triplex residence in Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower, the place he famously descended the escalator in 2015 to announce he was operating for president.\n\nDeclaring chapter is the one treatment assured to maintain the wolf away from Trump\u2019s lavishly gilded door, however he has reportedly dominated it out. That may seemingly give him years of respiratory room on the huge fines, which Trump ought to know given his previous: He has used chapter six instances largely to get out from underneath his silly and ruinous foray into the on line casino enterprise in Atlantic Metropolis.\n\nAfter all, submitting for chapter in the midst of the marketing campaign would threaten Trump\u2019s picture as a profitable, revered businessman. The Put up quoted a supply near Trump as saying: \u201cHe\u2019d relatively have Letitia James present up with the sheriff at 40 Wall [a Trump office tower] and make an enormous stink about it than say he\u2019s bankrupt.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s private money crunch is related as a result of the marketing campaign helps pay the hovering authorized payments that he and his associates \u2014 and co-defendants within the felony circumstances \u2014 are racking up. Trump\u2019s Save America political motion committee has spent $8.5 million on authorized prices because the starting of the yr.

Kareem Nikoui, one of 13 U.S. Marines killed in the Abbey Gate bombing during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.\n\nSteve Nikoui attended the State of the Union as a guest of Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., and was arrested by Capitol Police for repeatedly shouting \"Abbey Gate\" and \"Second Battalion, First Marines!\" at Biden during the speech.\n\nNikoui, 51, was charged with crowding, obstructing, or incommoding Congress, a misdemeanor that is typically resolved after a $50 fine is paid.\n\nAfter writing a letter to Capitol Police calling for an end to the prosecution of the Gold Star father, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., took to social media Tuesday to announce that all charges against Nikoui were dropped.\n\n\"He did nothing wrong. And this is the right decision,\" Issa said in a post on X.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Nikoui was \"thrilled and humbled\" when Issa gave him the news.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul, R-Texas, posted a statement on X on Tuesday about the turn of events.\n\n\"I am glad the D.C. Attorney General dropped these ludicrous charges against Gold Star father Steve Nikoui after my hearing on President Biden's deadly Afghanistan withdrawal,\" McCaul said. \"The President has yet to apologize to families like Steve's who lost loved ones in the terrorist bombing at Abbey Gate. These families deserve justice, not prosecution and persecution.\"\n\nAccording to National Review, a number of Gold Star families attended the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday, which examined the Biden's administration's failures in withdrawing from Afghanistan and featured testimony from former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley and U.S. Central Command retired Gen. Frank McKenzie.\n\nNikoui previously said that it was \"devastating\" to hear Biden mention slain Georgia nursing student Laken Riley at the State of the Union, given the fact that the president has never mentioned his son and the others who were killed in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I was just strongly convicted by the Holy Spirit to stand up and say that after sitting there for almost an hour of just total disrespect to us,\" Nikoui said. \"He knew that there were other Gold Star family members. He could have at least just said their names and this would have been done.'\"",

But he comes back for it.\n\nThe messages play over an image of a heart monitor that eventually flattens out.\n\nAs president, Trump came just one vote away from repealing the law and has said he wants to try again.\n\n\u201cIf he succeeds \u2026 45 million Americans could lose their health insurance,\u201d the ad said. \u201cAnd you might be one of them.\u201d\n\nThe campaign said the ad will run on digital platforms including Meta, YouTube and affiliate TV in English and Spanish in battleground states.\n\nIn addition to the ad, the campaign is holding a digital rally this weekend with former President Obama and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The national appeal aims to \u201cmobilize supporters and volunteers around defending the ACA from Trump\u2019s attacks,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is also running digital battleground ads criticizing Trump for his efforts to repeal the ACA.\n\nAds will appear as digital front pages on local newspaper websites in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Biden campaign and Democratic allies enthusiastically jumped into battle with Trump over ObamaCare after the presumptive GOP nominee emerged seeking to repeal the law.\n\nMore than 40 million people have health insurance through ObamaCare, and the law is more popular than ever. Biden campaign officials see keeping it as a major political issue as enrollments for coverage in 2024 hit a record 21.3 million.\n\nBiden and Democrats have long seen health care as a winning issue for them, and the president has targeted the pocketbook issue to cut people\u2019s costs amid broad concerns about the economy.\n\n\u201cWe cannot take this progress for granted. Extreme MAGA Republicans have voted over 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Just this week, Trump\u2019s allies in the House of Representatives proposed a budget that would gut this life-saving legislation,\u201d Biden said in a statement Friday, referring to the budget proposal from the Republican Study Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is not hyperbole to say that affordable health care for millions of people is on the line in November. I am more determined than ever to fight back against the Republican attacks on MAGA and make health care a right, not a privilege, in America,\u201d Biden said.\n\nCoverage of the 2024 election\n\nThe Biden campaign is also trying to use Trump\u2019s \u201care you better\u201d argument against him.\n\nOn Friday, Biden\u2019s team played a clip from a news conference exactly four years ago in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Trump said he wanted to \u201cend\u201d ObamaCare and reiterated his support for a lawsuit to end the law.\n\n\u201cTaking health care away from millions of Americans is always a bad idea, but Trump\u2019s efforts in March 2020 \u2014 when thousands of Americans were dying \u2014 couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cDonald Trump and his campaign keep asking the country if we are better off now than we were four years ago. Time and time again, the answer is yes.\u201d",

Kennedy Jr. apologized to members of his family who objected to a new TV ad released Sunday during the Super Bowl that repurposed a spot from his uncle\u2019s 1960 campaign.\n\nThe retro-themed ad from a PAC backing his candidacy mimics the soundtrack and theme of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 campaign ad. The spot features a dramatic orchestra opening and a jingle repeating the word \u201cKennedy\u201d over and over again.\n\nThe ad also feature the lyrics, \u201cDo you want a man for president who sees it through and through? A man who\u2019s old enough to know and young enough to do.\u201d The words are a potential jab from the 70-year-old Kennedy toward his somewhat older competitors, 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, in a race defined by criticisms of age and mental cognition.\n\n\u201cMy cousin\u2019s Super Bowl ad used our uncle\u2019s faces- and my Mother\u2019s. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA,\u201d Kennedy\u2019s cousin Bobby Shriver said on X following the release of the ad.\n\nAnother of Kennedy\u2019s cousins, Mark Shriver, replied to Bobby Shiver\u2019s post by saying \u201cI agree with my brother @bobbyshriver simple as that.\u201d\n\nBobby and Mark Shriver are sons of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President Kennedy and the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy responded to criticism from Bobby Shriver by apologizing.\n\n\u201cBobby. I\u2019m so sorry if that advertisement caused you pain. The ad was created and aired by the American Values Superpac without any involvement or approvals from my campaign. Federal rules prohibit Superpacs from consulting with me or my staff. I send you and your family my sincerest apologies. God bless you,\u201d Kennedy posted on X.\n\nAmerican Values 2024, the group supporting Kennedy\u2019s presidential bid, spent $7 million on the ad. More recently, the PAC faced allegations from the Democratic National Committee that it illegally contributed to Kennedy\u2019s signature-gathering efforts.\n\nKennedy has faced dissent from members of his family throughout his presidential run. On the day of he announced his intention to run for president as an independent, a group of his siblings called his decision to run against Biden in a general election \u201cdangerous to our country.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been a leading proponent of vaccine misinformation through his Children\u2019s Health Defense organization and has spent years wrongly suggesting that many vaccines are not safe. In a CNN interview in December, he walked back some of his comments and rejected the label that he\u2019s \u201canti-vaccine\u201d despite his history of spreading misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines.\n\nHe also made a series of comments in 2022 in which he compared the Covid-19 lockdowns to Nazi Germany, arguing that \u201ceven in Hitler\u2019s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland.\u201d\n\n\u201cBobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment,\u201d Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph P Kennedy II and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement in October.\n\nCNN\u2019s Liz Brown-Kaiser contributed to this story.",

            "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014Donald Trump crushed his opponents in nearly every Republican primary this year. But when it comes to the money race, President Biden has a big head start on his predecessor.\n\nIn February, Biden\u2019s campaign apparatus said it brought in more than $53 million, leaving it with more than $155 million on hand at the end of the month. Trump\u2019s operation by comparison reported raising $39.3 million\u2014with $74.4 million in the bank\u2014across his campaign committee, the Republican National Committee, a supportive super PAC and a leadership PAC, which has been drained by shelling out more than $53 million in legal-related expenses since early last year.\n\nAs the general election begins in earnest, the new figures underscore how much financial ground the former president has to make up on his likely Democratic challenger\u2014money used for pricey TV ads, campaign staff, office space, consulting fees and other expenses.\n\nView Full Image Graphic: WSJ\n\nTrump has retained a slight advantage in polls in battleground states, where thin margins will likely decide who wins the presidency in November. Money also doesn\u2019t necessarily equal guaranteed victory; Hillary Clinton bested Trump in the 2016 money race but still lost the White House. And Trump\u2019s fundraising is likely to pick up now that he has replaced the leadership at the RNC and formed a joint-fundraising committee.\n\nNonetheless, Biden\u2019s fundraising advantage lays bare the risks that Trump has going into spring and summer, when he\u2019ll accept his party\u2019s nomination at the Republican National Convention. His financial health might also reflect the segment of Republicans who say they\u2019ll refuse to vote for Trump even if he were the nominee, according to surveys of GOP primary voters by AP VoteCast.\n\nWhile the Biden team reported adding $25 million to its total cash holdings in February, Trump\u2019s cash\u2014across the campaign account, the RNC and two PACs\u2014increased by $9.2 million. The former president\u2019s February numbers include transfers from his Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which won\u2019t provide updated figures until it files next month.\n\nTrump\u2019s leadership PAC, Save America, spent $2.2 million more than it took in during February, lowering its cash on hand to $4.1 million at the end of the month. Among its expenditures during February: $1.3 million for research, $1.6 million on payroll and at least $1 million on data processing, according to new data from the Federal Election Commission.\n\nBiden and Trump have spent nearly identical amounts on advertising so far this year, according to data from AdImpact. From Jan. 1 through March 19, Biden\u2019s campaign and his joint fundraising committee had run $13.2 million in television, radio, satellite and online ads, compared with $13.3 million for Trump and his top allied committee.\n\nYet there\u2019s one key difference: Biden has been working to target general-election voters all year, while the bulk of the spending associated with Trump was to mobilize primary voters before he became the presumptive nominee. Biden\u2019s campaign also launched a six-week, $30 million ad blitz in swing states shortly after his March 7 State of the Union address.\n\nOther candidates\u2019 financial pictures have paled in comparison now that Trump and Biden have enough delegates to win their respective parties\u2019 nominations.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.reported raising $3.2 million in February, raising his cash on hand at the end of the month to $5.1 million. About 39% of his contributions came from small-dollar donors who have given $200 or less during the presidential cycle.\n\nJohn McCormick contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jack Gillum at jack.gillum@wsj.com and Anthony DeBarros at anthony.debarros@wsj.com",

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nThe Biden administration and the state of Texas on Wednesday are making oral arguments in a high-profile case over the state\u2019s anti-illegal immigration law \u2014 hours after it was briefly blocked by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe oral arguments over the law, known as Senate Bill 4, were set to begin at 11 a.m. ET. The law, signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in December, allows police to arrest those suspected of entering the U.S. illegally. It adds \"improper border entry\" as a new criminal offense and state judges would be allowed to order deportations to Mexico.\n\nThe Biden administration sued over the law, which it said crossed into federal authority on matters related to immigration enforcement. It marks the most significant effort by a state to challenge federal enforcement since an Arizona law in 2012 \u2014 which was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\nMEXICO SLAMS TEXAS OVER IMMIGRATION LAW, WON'T ACCEPT REPATRIATIONS FROM STATE AFTER SCOTUS RULING\n\n\"Its efforts, through SB 4, intrude on the federal government\u2019s exclusive authority to regulate the entry and removal of noncitizens, frustrate the United States\u2019 immigration operations and proceedings, and interfere with U.S. foreign relations,\" the Department of Justice said in its January lawsuit.\n\nTexas, however, has said the law is necessary due to a void in immigration enforcement by the Biden administration amid a historic and ongoing crisis at the southern border, where Texas has been on the front line.\n\nGOVERNOR WHO CLASHED WITH OBAMA OVER ATTEMPTED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN REACTS TO SCOTUS TEXAS RULING\n\n\"The President of the United States has a constitutional duty to enforce federal laws protecting States, including laws already on the books that mandate the detention of illegal immigrants,\" Abbott argued last month. \"Texas has the right to defend itself because of President Biden's ongoing failure to fulfill his duty to protect our state from the invasion at our southern border.\"\n\nThe Fifth Circuit of Appeals had blocked the law from going into effect. The Supreme Court on Tuesday evening, not ruling on the merits of the case, allowed the law to go into effect and kicked it back to the Fifth Circuit.\n\nHours later, the Fifth Circuit again put the law on hold, ahead of oral arguments on the merits of the case on Wednesday.\n\nSUPREME COURT OKS LAW LETTING TEXAS POLICE ARREST MIGRANTS SUSPECTED OF ILLEGALLY CROSSING BORDER\n\nThe battle over the law is the latest legal feud between Texas and the administration over how to handle the crisis at the border. The two sides have also fought in the courts over the construction of razor wire by Texas and the establishment of buoys in the Rio Grande.\n\nIn January, Texas seized Shelby Park \u2014 a key area of Eagle Pass for migrant crossings \u2014 and refused to allow federal officials into the area.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday brought an immediate protest from Mexico as well, which said it would not accept any attempt to return migrants by state authorities.\n\n\"Mexico recognizes the importance of a uniform migration policy and the bilateral efforts with the United States to ensure that migration is safe, orderly and respectful of human rights, and is not affected by state or local legislative decisions. In this regard, Mexico will not accept, under any circumstances, repatriations by the State of Texas,\" Mexico\u2019s Foreign Ministry said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt comes as the crisis at the border is set to be a top issue in the upcoming general election in November. Both President Biden and former President Trump visited Texas last month and made their respective pitches.\n\nTrump has called for mass deportations and has expressed his support for Abbott\u2019s efforts to secure the border. Biden has urged Congress to pass a bipartisan border funding bill hashed out in the Senate, arguing that his administration needs reforms and more funding in order to be able to secure the border.\n\nFox News Digital's Louis Casiano contributed to this report.",
