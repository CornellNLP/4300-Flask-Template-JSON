    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014Donald Trump crushed his opponents in nearly every Republican primary this year. But when it comes to the money race, President Biden has a big head start on his predecessor.\n\nIn February, Biden\u2019s campaign apparatus said it brought in more than $53 million, leaving it with more than $155 million on hand at the end of the month. Trump\u2019s operation by comparison reported raising $39.3 million\u2014with $74.4 million in the bank\u2014across his campaign committee, the Republican National Committee, a supportive super PAC and a leadership PAC, which has been drained by shelling out more than $53 million in legal-related expenses since early last year.\n\nAs the general election begins in earnest, the new figures underscore how much financial ground the former president has to make up on his likely Democratic challenger\u2014money used for pricey TV ads, campaign staff, office space, consulting fees and other expenses.\n\nView Full Image Graphic: WSJ\n\nTrump has retained a slight advantage in polls in battleground states, where thin margins will likely decide who wins the presidency in November. Money also doesn\u2019t necessarily equal guaranteed victory; Hillary Clinton bested Trump in the 2016 money race but still lost the White House. And Trump\u2019s fundraising is likely to pick up now that he has replaced the leadership at the RNC and formed a joint-fundraising committee.\n\nNonetheless, Biden\u2019s fundraising advantage lays bare the risks that Trump has going into spring and summer, when he\u2019ll accept his party\u2019s nomination at the Republican National Convention. His financial health might also reflect the segment of Republicans who say they\u2019ll refuse to vote for Trump even if he were the nominee, according to surveys of GOP primary voters by AP VoteCast.\n\nWhile the Biden team reported adding $25 million to its total cash holdings in February, Trump\u2019s cash\u2014across the campaign account, the RNC and two PACs\u2014increased by $9.2 million. The former president\u2019s February numbers include transfers from his Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, which won\u2019t provide updated figures until it files next month.\n\nTrump\u2019s leadership PAC, Save America, spent $2.2 million more than it took in during February, lowering its cash on hand to $4.1 million at the end of the month. Among its expenditures during February: $1.3 million for research, $1.6 million on payroll and at least $1 million on data processing, according to new data from the Federal Election Commission.\n\nBiden and Trump have spent nearly identical amounts on advertising so far this year, according to data from AdImpact. From Jan. 1 through March 19, Biden\u2019s campaign and his joint fundraising committee had run $13.2 million in television, radio, satellite and online ads, compared with $13.3 million for Trump and his top allied committee.\n\nYet there\u2019s one key difference: Biden has been working to target general-election voters all year, while the bulk of the spending associated with Trump was to mobilize primary voters before he became the presumptive nominee. Biden\u2019s campaign also launched a six-week, $30 million ad blitz in swing states shortly after his March 7 State of the Union address.\n\nOther candidates\u2019 financial pictures have paled in comparison now that Trump and Biden have enough delegates to win their respective parties\u2019 nominations.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.reported raising $3.2 million in February, raising his cash on hand at the end of the month to $5.1 million. About 39% of his contributions came from small-dollar donors who have given $200 or less during the presidential cycle.\n\nJohn McCormick contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jack Gillum at jack.gillum@wsj.com and Anthony DeBarros at anthony.debarros@wsj.com",
