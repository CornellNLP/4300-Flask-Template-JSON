    "text": "The U.S. Justice Department and more than a dozen states filed a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit against Apple on Thursday, accusing the giant company of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest in a recent string of Big Tech companies to face antitrust complaints from the U.S. government, which is cracking down on the massive industry, whose power has gone largely unchecked over the past several decades.\n\nThe complaint, said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a news conference, alleges that \u201dApple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal antitrust law.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law,\u201d he added.\n\nThe long-anticipated lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey, comes after years of allegations by critics that Apple has harmed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach to its hardware and software: Apple famously makes its tech easy to use, but it achieves that by tightly controlling \u2013 and in some cases, restricting \u2013 how third-party companies can interact with the tech behemoth\u2019s products and services. In some cases, Apple may give its own products better access and features than its competitors.\n\nThe company said it denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and would fight them and added that the lawsuit could empower government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d\n\nBut Garland on Thursday said Apple\u2019s actions have wide-ranging effects.\n\n\u201cMonopolies like Apple\u2019s threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation. They hurt producers and workers and increase cost for consumers,\u201d Garland said Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly. But there\u2019s a law for that,\u201d he added.\n\nFor example, Apple allows iPhone customers to send high-quality photos and videos seamlessly to one another, but multimedia texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. The company late last year relented and agreed to improve the quality standard it uses to interact with Android phones via text message \u2013 but it still maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue.\n\nThe company also gives its own products the ability to access certain parts of its hardware that it restricts other companies from using. That unleashes an almost magical experience for how iPhones interact with AirTags, when competitors\u2019 products are far more limited in their capabilities.\n\n\u201cApple creates barriers that make it extremely difficult and expensive for both users and developers to venture outside the Apple ecosystem,\u201d Garland said on Thursday.\n\n\u2018We will vigorously defend against it\u2019\n\nThis year, European regulations forced Apple to give other companies access to the iPhone\u2019s tap-to-pay hardware chip, enabling the creation of competing digital wallets. But those rules are limited to the European Union.\n\nAnd Apple maintains a 30 per cent commission on most sales through its app store \u2013 a frequent complaint from companies that try to sell subscriptions, saying Apple\u2019s enormous share of the smartphone market forces them to pay what they argue is an unnecessarily high commission.\n\n\u201cWe believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\n\nThursday\u2019s suit claims Apple has illegally monopolized smartphone markets by using a complex web of contractual terms that harm everything from text messaging to mobile payments. Among other things, the DOJ says, Apple has used its control over iOS, the iPhone operating system, to block innovative new apps and cloud streaming services from the public; degrade how Android messages appear on iPhones; restricted how competing smartwatches can work with iPhones; and hindered rival payment solutions.\n\nApple, in a statement, said the lawsuit would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d and hinder its ability to make the compelling and consumer-friendly technology that have made the company one of the most valuable in the world.\n\n\u201cAt Apple, we innovate every day to make technology people love \u2013 designing products that work seamlessly together, protect people\u2019s privacy and security, and create a magical experience for our users,\u201d the company said in its statement. \u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.\u201d\n\nYears of scrutiny\n\nApple has shrugged off legal challenges and criticism for years that its practices are anticompetitive. Its sterling consumer reputation and a disciplined public relations and legal strategy mirror the precision with which Apple manufactures and oversees its products.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s landmark suit challenges a broad range of Apple\u2019s practices.\n\nThe case represents the Biden administration\u2019s latest effort to hold a Big Tech giant accountable under U.S. antitrust law.\n\nApple was named in a sprawling House report in 2020 finding that the iPhone maker, along with Meta, Google and Amazon, hold \u201cmonopoly power.\u201d Until Thursday, Apple was the only one of those tech companies the federal government had not yet sued for alleged antitrust violations.\n\nThe legal action could weigh on Apple\u2019s stock price, which currently values the company at just under $3 trillion, and could force changes to policies, business strategies, products and applications by the tech giant. Even divestment of some assets is not out of the question for Apple, the tech company founded by Steve Jobs in the 1970s.\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock fell 3 per cent Thursday. The lawsuit was widely anticipated.\n\nAlong with a pair of ongoing antitrust cases against Google, the DOJ lawsuit against Apple is likely to become a symbol of the Biden administration\u2019s commitment to competition and lowering prices. It will also be a test of how far courts are willing to go to apply decades-old antitrust law to the modern digital economy.\n\nThe Apple case may be one of the most closely watched lawsuits brought by Jonathan Kanter, Biden\u2019s top DOJ antitrust official. Kanter, who in private practice once represented rivals to Google including Microsoft and Yelp, is viewed as part of a fresh generation of regulators.\n\nAlong with his counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, Kanter has argued that the United States has for decades allowed a wave of corporate consolidation and anticompetitive practices that ultimately harmed the public through higher prices, fewer choices or reduced innovation.\n\nApps vs Apple\n\nTo solve Android phone customers\u2019 \u201cgreen bubble\u201d issue, Eric Migicovsky, a tech entrepreneur, says an app he created, dubbed Beeper Mini, to help Android users message iPhone users without those limitations was quickly shut down by Apple.\n\n\u201cIt lasted for a total of three days before Apple started to take swings at us,\u201d Migicovsky said. \u201cTechnologically, they worked very hard to take actions to penalize Beeper Mini users by knocking the connection offline or by making it progressively more unreliable.\u201d\n\nThose kind of interactions have made Apple\u2019s app store a focus of antitrust complaints.\n\nBeginning in 2020, Apple fought a highly public court battle against Epic Games, maker of the video game \u201cFortnite.\u201d\n\nApple isn\u2019t an illegal monopolist in distributing iOS apps, federal courts have decided in that case, highlighting the difficulty of pinning Apple down on federal antitrust charges. Apple did, however, get penalized for violating a California competition law and altered some of its app store practices in response to a court order.\n\nThose rulings highlight the challenges ahead for the Justice Department, which will need to bring a strong legal theory about how Apple has allegedly harmed competition, legal experts say. The DOJ would also need to prove that the benefits Apple has delivered to consumers don\u2019t outweigh its alleged antitrust violations.\n\nEurope\u2019s bite at Apple\n\nThe U.S. government isn\u2019t the only one to pressure Apple to change its business practices. In March, a new European Union law took effect that forces Apple to make significant adjustments.\n\nIn a seismic move to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple said for the first time it would allow users in the trading bloc to download apps from third-party app stores.\n\nBut critics including Epic are already accusing Apple of violating the EU law. Just before the DMA took effect, Epic complained to competition authorities that Apple blocked it from launching its own app store on iOS. The European Commission is investigating.\n\nUpstart turned behemoth\n\nSince its early days, Apple has pursued a reputation as an elite, high-design brand. It\u2019s often focused on a premium user experience and design aesthetic, setting its products apart from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. That limited approach worked for years, until a wave of complaints by app developers and consumers drew more attention to the potential downsides of Apple\u2019s restrictiveness.\n\nIn the era led by founder Steve Jobs, \u201cApple was a cultural phenomenon that pitted wingtips against sandals; suits against t-shirts,\u201d said James Bailey, a professor of leadership development at the George Washington University School of Business. \u201cApple relentlessly innovated. They were always steps ahead of the competition.\u201d\n\nNow, however, Apple\u2019s advances are more \u201cincremental\u201d than earth-shattering, Bailey added. \u201c[CEO Tim] Cook has been focused on financial management and expanding market share.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s financially healthy,\u201d Bailey said, but their reputation for innovation is \u201cdimming.\u201d",
