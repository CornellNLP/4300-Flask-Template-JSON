    "text": "Today, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability held a hearing titled, \u201cInfluence Peddling: Examining Joe Biden\u2019s Abuse of Public Office.\u201d Witnesses included Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis who testified that Joe Biden knew about, participated in, and enabled his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes that made his family over $24 million. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (CO-03) said, \u201cJoe Biden has leveraged his elected position to enable the Biden family, their business associates, and their shell companies to receive over $24 million dollars from China and other entities. Biden is compromised and a threat to our national security. It is far past time Congress evict the resident in the White House and hold him accountable for selling out the American people.\u201d Background Courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability: Biden family business associates Tony Bobulinski and Jason Galanis testified under oath President Joe Biden actively participated in his family\u2019s corrupt business dealings and acted as the closer for deals with Chinese and Russian entities. Mr. Tony Bobulinski, Biden family business associate: \u201cJoe Biden was more than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business; he was an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\u201d Mr. Jason Galanis, Biden family business associate: \u201cDuring the May 4th party, we were told to go to an area of the restaurant to gather because Hunter was going to call his father. Hunter called his father, said hello and \u2018hold on, Pops,\u2019 then put the call on speakerphone and said, \u2018I am here with our friends I told you were coming to town, and we wanted to say hello.\u2019 The Vice President said hello and some pleasantries [\u2026] and then seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, \u2018Ok then, you be good to my boy.\u2019 Hunter responded by saying, \u2018Everything is good, and we are moving ahead.\u2019 The Vice President said something about \u2018being helpful,\u2019 and Hunter ended the call by saying that he was going to call his father later. [\u2026] A few days after this May 4th party, an email my lawyer provided to this committee shows that Devon had confirmed Ms. Baturina was committed to a \u2018hard order\u2019 of $10-20 million in a Burnham investment banking client.\u201d The Bidens don\u2019t sell a product or a service or a set of skills. President Joe Biden is \u201cthe brand\u201d that the Biden family is selling for millions of dollars to those around the world willing to pay for it. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cI want to be crystal clear: from my direct personal experience and what I have subsequently come to learn, it is clear to me that Joe Biden was \u2018the Brand\u2019 being sold by the Biden family. His family\u2019s foreign influence peddling operation \u2013 from China to Ukraine and elsewhere \u2013 sold out to foreign actors who were seeking to gain influence and access to Joe Biden and the United States government. Mr. Jason Galanis: \u201cThe entire value-add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden.\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.): \u201cThe scam is simple. It\u2019s done over and over again. The Biden family promises Joe\u2019s power, Joe Biden shows up, and millions of dollars come into the Bidens\u2019 pockets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio): \u201cMillions of dollars from foreign entities run through twenty different companies, for what? Devon Archer told us what it was for: Access to the brand. And the brand was Joe Biden. The brand that played rounds of golf, took calls and meetings, attended lunches and dinners with Hunter Biden and his business partners.\u201d Hunter Biden failed to appear alongside his business associates today because his testimony would not withstand public scrutiny when held up against witness facts and evidence uncovered showing Joe Biden\u2019s involvement in the business schemes. Hunter for months has requested a public hearing, but when offered one alongside his business associates, he failed to show up. Mr. Bobulinski: \u201cHow are the American people supposed to get the unvarnished facts and truth when the son and brother of Joe Biden are willing to perjure themselves to protect the family?\u201d President Joe Biden continues to lie directly to the American people about the central role he played in his family\u2019s corrupt influence peddling schemes. Mr. Tony Bobulinski: \u201cWhy is Joe Biden blatantly lying to the American people? Why has he not simply leveled with the American people about all of the meetings, phone calls, emails and handshakes he has had with the Biden family\u2019s U.S. and foreign business partners, including players from some of America\u2019s most challenging adversaries such as China and Russia, as well as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Romania and others. If he were doing nothing wrong, why go through this insane exercise of obstructing and denying obvious facts?\u201d The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability released a video exposing Joe Biden\u2019s repeated lies about his family\u2019s influence peddling business. The video uses new footage from recent transcribed interviews with key witnesses who testified today. ###",
