    "text": "Wilton, Connecticut: Donald Trump\u2019s election campaign is calling for donations from 1 million of his backers, warning he could lose his New York properties, after the former US president failed to secure a bond to cover a $US454 million ($686 million) judgment in a civil fraud case.\n\n\u201cKEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF OF TRUMP TOWER!,\u201d reads a message to supporters from a joint fundraising committee that allocates the money it collects to his campaign and a separate political committee that has been paying Trump\u2019s legal bills.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign wasted no time asking donors for more funds after the bond flop. Credit: AP\n\nThe civil fraud case, brought by New York state Attorney-General Letitia James in September 2022, is one of several legal cases Trump faces ahead of the November 5 election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nThe message, sent by text with prompts for supporters to donate in amounts ranging from $US20.24 to $US3300 or a specific amount, accuses James of wanting to seize Trump\u2019s properties and portrays her actions as part of a broader effort by Biden and Democrats to harm his reelection campaign.",
