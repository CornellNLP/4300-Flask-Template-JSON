When we had empty shelves in supermarkets? The toilet paper and mask shortages? Constant, soul-crushing fear?\n\nAnd the death. So much death. One thousand people a day. There were mobile morgues in New York City desperately trying to keep up with all the dead bodies.\n\nAnd there was Trump, callously, viciously not giving a damn, insisting it was all going swimmingly, snapping at reporters who wanted to know what the president of the United States had to say to terrified Americans.\n\nBiden\u2019s ad brings it all back.\n\n\u201cYeah, no, I don\u2019t take responsibility at all,\u201d Trump said four years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re doing, I think, really, really well.\u201d\n\nBut most of us were not doing really, really well. And those of us who remember are the lucky ones because we\u2019re the ones who survived.\n\nBut none of that mattered to Trump four years ago.\n\nAsked about all that death, he said, \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d\n\nNow, four years later, Trump thinks it\u2019s a great idea to remind people of where they were four years ago. Biden\u2019s ad suggests it\u2019s really, really not.",
