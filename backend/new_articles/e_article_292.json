This comes just months after he donated more than $113,000.\n\nErgen, a former professional poker player who helped start the company then called EchoStar Communications in 1980, has been fighting federal fraud claims for nearly a decade.\n\nBut the Tennessee native donated $100,000 to Biden\u2019s super PAC with his spouse, Candy, shortly after reaching the cap with a matching $6,600 contribution to the president\u2019s primary campaign committee in December. , reported that he saw his luck change. Campaign finance declaration form.\n\nIn January of this year, Dish $50 million Government grants to support national expansion of 5G coveragebiggest prize\u201d and the company has gushed about this kind of project through a $1.5 billion fund established by CHIPS and Science Law.\n\nDish Chairman Charlie Ergen has been fighting a civil fraud lawsuit for nearly a decade that could bankrupt the company. Reuters\n\nOn January 12, two days after the $50 million award was announced, Justice Department lawyers intervened on Dish\u2019s behalf, calling Vermont Telephone, which had made fraudulent claims, \u201cinto an unethical settlement.\u201d He threatened her and \u201ctried to bully her.\u201d Lead attorney Bennett Ross said the lawsuit will be dismissed.\n\nThe motion to dismiss the case reversed plans to dismiss the Ergens for their knowledge of the fraud scheme and led Vermont Telephone\u2019s lawyers to accuse the Justice Department of political interference.\n\n\u201c[I]\u201dThe effect, if not the purpose, of the Department of Justice\u2019s hasty dismissal of this case appears to be to protect Mr. Ergen from questioning under oath,\u201d Ross wrote in a letter to the Justice Department\u2019s lead attorney in the case. I wrote this in a letter dated August 8th. , according to a copy seen by The Post.\n\n\u201cIt just so happens that Mr. Ergen, his wife (who is scheduled to be removed from office next week), and DISH\u2019s political action committee have collectively donated more than $5 million to Democratic candidates and campaigns between 2008 and 2022. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAs the election approaches, this case appears to be the latest example of the Justice Department\u2019s two-tiered justice system, where wealthy and politically connected people are treated one way and everyone else is treated differently. \u201d\n\nThe government formally filed a motion to dismiss on March 8. Sentencing by D.C. Senior District Judge Colleen Koller Kotelly is pending.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division is objecting to the lawsuit being dismissed in 2022 and 2023, according to court filings, which say it is highly unusual to intervene in such fraud claims.\n\nThe Commerce Department gave Dish its \u201clargest award\u201d to date from the $1.5 billion fund created by the CHIPS and Science Act, one of the Biden administration\u2019s most celebrated achievements. AP\n\n\u201cAs far as we know, the parties involved have filed approximately 4,000 complaints.\u201d [similar] \u201cSince 2018, the Department of Justice has filed dismissal claims in about 65 of the False Claims Act cases, less than 2% of the time,\u201d Ross told the Post.\n\n\u201cAnd in the cases the Justice Department has sought to dismiss, it has generally been based on fatal flaws in the case, which does not apply to Vermont Telephone\u2019s claims against DISH.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the paucity of evidence and the difficulty of proving damages, the government\u2019s benefit in continuing the lawsuit is minimal. To the contrary, as a result of the extraordinary discovery, The costs to the government (and this court) will be high.\u201d\n\nBy taking control of small businesses, Dish acquired an additional $3.3 billion in wireless licenses before the company offered cell phone service. Gary E. Dufour/Facebook\n\nThe dispute began in 2015, and according to previous FCC filings, Dish is considered a \u201cvery small business\u201d (defined as a business with less than $15 million in revenue) by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). $13.3 billion was bid for wireless licenses as part of an auction aimed at supporting the United States. report According to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWith the help of asset management firm BlackRock, Dish has acquired nearly half of the wireless licenses (spectrum) sold at auction by small and medium-sized businesses (702 out of 1,600) in which Dish has a controlling interest and is eligible for a 25% discount. ).\n\nThis allowed Dish to make a $3.3 billion bid for spectrum in Boston, New York, and Chicago before the company offered cell phone service.\n\nAccording to a May 13, 2015 complaint, the Vermont Telephone Company sued Dish and its small businesses, Northstar Wireless and SNR Wireless, in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing them of engaging in a \u201cfraudulent bidding scheme.\u201d vermont telephone company\n\n\u201cDefendants shorted the government $3.3 billion, which remains unpaid to this day,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThey also corrupted programs designed to benefit genuine small businesses, distorted the FCC auction process, and impeded the deployment of wireless spectrum for the public benefit. Defendants are held accountable.\u201d You should.\u201d\n\nThe FCC later dismissed these claims of fraud, but Dish did not receive the $3.3 billion in bidding credits it earned in the auction, which were returned to the pool to be auctioned later.\n\nA senior FCC official told the Post that the agency was \u201cnot in a position to determine whether it was fraud\u201d at the time and was \u201choping that this action would set the record straight.\u201d\n\nHowever, the official said, \u201cDish has annual revenues of well over $10 billion, continues to be profitable, and receives FCC subsidies for companies with less than $50 million in revenue. We established a shell company for this purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that the Justice Department would try to dismiss it at the 11th hour without any intention.\u201d\n\n\u201cDish has generated and continues to generate well over $10 billion in annual revenue, but it has created a shell company to receive FCC subsidies for companies with less than $50 million in revenue. established,\u201d a senior FCC official told the Post. AP\n\nAs the lawsuit progresses, Dish has grown to become the fourth largest wireless network in the United States, thanks to acquisitions of carriers such as Sprint. In September 2023, Dish\u2019s net worth was approximately $54 billion.\n\nDish has pledged to spend billions of dollars building out its 5G network, leaving its own wireless spectrum occupied at the same time its TV customers are hemorrhaging and putting its business in a precarious position. There is.\n\nspeculation swirled A person familiar with the matter said the station could file for bankruptcy this year after its acquisition by Echostar left it \u201ccash-strapped,\u201d and an unfavorable civil lawsuit could result in 60. It added that more than $1 billion in damages could be awarded.\n\nLast year, Ergen acknowledged on an earnings call that the \u201cbond market is essentially closed\u201d for the company, with its bonds trading at just 30 cents on the dollar. This indicates that investors think the company is unlikely to pay off its debt. Last year, he even flew to Dubai in hopes of collaborating with a Middle East sovereign wealth fund.\n\nOther sources said Ergen has been \u201cvery close to the White House\u201d throughout Biden\u2019s tenure, frequently \u201cbragging\u201d about his connections and even been seen coming in and out of FCC headquarters.\n\nSources told the Post that Ergen has been \u201cvery close to the White House\u201d throughout Biden\u2019s tenure, frequently \u201cbragging\u201d about his connections and frequenting FCC headquarters. It has also been seen there. AFP (via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cDish is very good at navigating the beltway,\u201d said Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics. They have strong relationships on both sides of the aisle. \u201d\n\nMr. Ergen has donated most of his money to Democrats, but in recent years he has donated to more than a dozen people, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. He has also donated tens of thousands of dollars to several prominent Republicans. They all serve on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which oversees the FCC.\n\nThe Dish boss has also worked with influential Republicans such as Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee and if they If someone wanted to investigate him or his business, it could make his life difficult.\n\nwhite house visitor record show Ergen met with Biden officials at least three times, including on Oct. 16, 2023, with Kurt Campbell, then deputy chief of staff and now chief of staff.

Expand access to 5G coverage Over a year ago.\n\ndespite having angered the FCC Ergen has been slow to develop radio, making it potentially important to the Biden-Harris administration. Modernization efforts This is thanks to Dish\u2019s Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) technology.\n\n\u201cORAN provides them with what is considered a more affordable option because it separates software and hardware,\u201d one source said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to rely on proprietary technology to provide nationwide service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Dish keeps going to the White House and telling everyone, \u2018Listen, ORAN is the best thing since sliced \u200b\u200bbread,'\u201d the source said. added.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, that\u2019s exactly what the Biden administration wants to hear and wants other countries to sing the same song. There is a partnership between the two.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Ergen\u2019s political connections are enough to provide a lifeline to his company.\n\nDish reported earlier this month that it lost customers and revenue declined in the final quarter of 2023. He also acknowledged in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he \u201cexpects to use significant amounts of cash\u201d to repay debt, but cautioned that it was unclear how he would do so. He will pay the $1.98 billion debt he is due in November.\n\n\u201cThis raises significant doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d the filing acknowledges.\n\nJeff Blum, Echostar\u2019s executive vice president of external and government affairs, told the Post in a statement that \u201cfraud claims have always been frivolous, and the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to dismiss them is That\u2019s completely legitimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, the FCC thoroughly investigated the allegations and found no misrepresentations or wrongdoing by EchoStar or its business partners.The Department of Justice then gave VTel years to uncover evidence of fraud. \u201cBlum said.\n\n\u201cDespite tens of thousands of discovery documents and countless depositions, VTel has never been able to prove any wrongdoing. And last year, contrary to VTel\u2019s claims that the government had fallen short, , the government itself said in sworn testimony that all payments were made in a timely manner. It was a deadline. \u201d\n\nBloom said the motion is a \u201cdesperate attempt by VTel and its attorneys to avoid having to pay millions of dollars in legal fees on this baseless lawsuit.\u201d intends to pursue all legal remedies against the frivolous conduct of VTel and its lawyers.\u201d Claim. \u201c\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of record that Ecostar and Charlie Ergen have supported both Republicans and Democrats over the years,\u201d Blum added about the donations. \u201cAs EchoStar builds the world\u2019s largest Open RAN wireless network, we are working closely with policymakers on both sides to return U.S. leadership to carriers and create a true alternative to Chinese vendor dominance. We\u2019ve provided options.\u201d\n\nNeither the White House nor the Biden campaign responded to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment on pending litigation.",
