    "text": "CNN \u2014\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. apologized to members of his family who objected to a new TV ad released Sunday during the Super Bowl that repurposed a spot from his uncle\u2019s 1960 campaign.\n\nThe retro-themed ad from a PAC backing his candidacy mimics the soundtrack and theme of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 campaign ad. The spot features a dramatic orchestra opening and a jingle repeating the word \u201cKennedy\u201d over and over again.\n\nThe ad also feature the lyrics, \u201cDo you want a man for president who sees it through and through? A man who\u2019s old enough to know and young enough to do.\u201d The words are a potential jab from the 70-year-old Kennedy toward his somewhat older competitors, 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 77-year-old former President Donald Trump, in a race defined by criticisms of age and mental cognition.\n\n\u201cMy cousin\u2019s Super Bowl ad used our uncle\u2019s faces- and my Mother\u2019s. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA,\u201d Kennedy\u2019s cousin Bobby Shriver said on X following the release of the ad.\n\nAnother of Kennedy\u2019s cousins, Mark Shriver, replied to Bobby Shiver\u2019s post by saying \u201cI agree with my brother @bobbyshriver simple as that.\u201d\n\nBobby and Mark Shriver are sons of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President Kennedy and the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy responded to criticism from Bobby Shriver by apologizing.\n\n\u201cBobby. I\u2019m so sorry if that advertisement caused you pain. The ad was created and aired by the American Values Superpac without any involvement or approvals from my campaign. Federal rules prohibit Superpacs from consulting with me or my staff. I send you and your family my sincerest apologies. God bless you,\u201d Kennedy posted on X.\n\nAmerican Values 2024, the group supporting Kennedy\u2019s presidential bid, spent $7 million on the ad. More recently, the PAC faced allegations from the Democratic National Committee that it illegally contributed to Kennedy\u2019s signature-gathering efforts.\n\nKennedy has faced dissent from members of his family throughout his presidential run. On the day of he announced his intention to run for president as an independent, a group of his siblings called his decision to run against Biden in a general election \u201cdangerous to our country.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been a leading proponent of vaccine misinformation through his Children\u2019s Health Defense organization and has spent years wrongly suggesting that many vaccines are not safe. In a CNN interview in December, he walked back some of his comments and rejected the label that he\u2019s \u201canti-vaccine\u201d despite his history of spreading misinformation about the efficacy of vaccines.\n\nHe also made a series of comments in 2022 in which he compared the Covid-19 lockdowns to Nazi Germany, arguing that \u201ceven in Hitler\u2019s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland.\u201d\n\n\u201cBobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment,\u201d Rory Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Joseph P Kennedy II and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement in October.\n\nCNN\u2019s Liz Brown-Kaiser contributed to this story.",
