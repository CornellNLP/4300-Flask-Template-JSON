    "text": "Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb dropped charges against Steve Nikoui, a Gold Star father who was arrested for disrupting President Joe Biden\u2019s State of the Union Address, after a significant backlash, Fox News reported Tuesday.\n\nBoth the Speaker\u2019s Office and the D.C. AG\u2019s office confirmed to Fox News that the charges had been dropped. The AG\u2019s office told the outlet that its decision to not move forward with the charges was typical when dealing with protesters.\n\nNikoui was detained after he shouted \u201cAbbey Gate! Kareem Nikoui! Second Battalion, First Marines!\u201d as Biden spoke about murder rates in his annual address. Authorities led Nikoui from the chamber and charged him with a misdemeanor for \u201ccrowding, obstructing, or incommoding\u201d during a protest \u2014 a charge that carries a fine of up to $500 and 90 days in prison.\n\nThe guy who heckled Biden from the upper seating area shouted \u201cUnited States Marines;\u201d perhaps in reference to the 13 Marines the President killed with his disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. pic.twitter.com/n3OPgvVdtZ \u2014 Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) March 8, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNikoui\u2019s son Kareem was one of 13 members of the U.S. military killed in a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport during the Biden administration\u2019s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. At least 170 civilians were also killed in that attack.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I disrespected anyone,\u201d Nikoui said in an interview with Morning Wire. \u201cI don\u2019t think I dishonored my son.\u201d\n\nNikoui blames the Biden administration for his son\u2019s death, explaining that, \u201cThey were told to leave 2,500 troops there. 2,000 troops could have manned Bagram and then 500 extra to help. And that was in place in the agreement. But [Biden] took it to something like 136 troops. If they would have followed Trump\u2019s agreement, my son would be alive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) sent a letter to Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger on Monday arguing that the charges against him should be dropped.\n\n\u201cMr. Nikoui\u2019s arrest for emotionally expressing his grief and seeking acknowledgment for his son\u2019s sacrifice during the State of the Union \u2013 where he called out, \u2018Abbey Gate! Kareem Nikoui! Second Battalion, First Marines!\u2019 \u2013 highlighted a profound disconnect between the sacrifices made by our service members and the recognition they deserve,\u201d Issa said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThough he interrupted the event, what Mr. Nikoui voiced out loud was a cry for the acknowledgment of the loss endured by the families of the 13 who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country,\u201d he added.\n\nDaniel Chaitin contributed to this report.",
