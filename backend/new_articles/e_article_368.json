Biden meanwhile spent $6.3 million in the month but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nThose figures however don\u2019t show the complete picture for either candidate as filings from their various fundraising committees won\u2019t be made until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said at the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, leaving it with a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most by any Democrat at this stage in the election cycle.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Dumpster fire\u2019 \u2013\n\nPerhaps the most worrying element for Trump are his giant legal fees, as he faces criminal cases including for trying to subvert his 2020 election loss and keeping secret documents.\n\nLawyers\u2019 bills accounted for a huge $5.6 million of the money spent in February by Trump\u2019s Save America political action committee \u2014 money that could otherwise be going towards campaigning and TV spots.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he struggles to raise a $464 million bond to appeal a fine by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces having his assets seized in a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump cast the fraud case as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d seeking as he often does to use the legal cases against him to whip up his supporters \u2014 and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on ONE MILLION Pro-Trump patriots to chip in and say: STOP THE WITCH HUNT AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP!\u201d a campaign message on Wednesday said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF TRUMP TOWER,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk from the court case.\n\nEarlier this month Trump managed to put together a separate bond for $91.6 million as he appeals a sexual assault and defamation judgment in a lawsuit brought by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign described Trump\u2019s finances as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s filings paint a bleak picture for Republicans,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa wrote on Thursday.\n\nBut with a tight election looming and Trump leading Biden in key swing states in recent polls, Democrats will be trying to keep their war chest as full as possible.\n\nBiden will be joined at a fundraiser in New York on March 28 by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the first event of its kind to feature three Democratic presidents and among the most lucrative in party history.\n\nThe gala show is set to raise $10 million for Biden\u2019s campaign, with guests having to fork out $100,000 each to pose in a photo with the 42nd, 44th and 46th US presidents, NBC News reported.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
