    "text": "Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is again taking GOP Speaker Mike Johnson to the woodshed \u2013 although this time not by name \u2013 for refusing to put on the floor for a vote the Senate\u2019s bipartisan bill that would provide critical aid to Ukraine. Some political experts have said the legislation would easily pass by a wide margin, and others have blasted the Speaker for his refusal, noting his history as a backbencher of voting against supporting Ukraine.\n\nOne week ago McConnell told reporters, \u201cI want to encourage the Speaker again to allow a vote \u2013 let the House speak\u201d on the Senate\u2019s Ukraine aid bill.\n\nMore than a month ago, on February 13, the Senate passed a $95 billion aid package, known as the national security supplemental, with funding for Ukraine and Israel. As soon as it passed Johnson made clear it would not see a vote in the House. Donald Trump opposes the legislation.\n\n\u201cThe foreign aid package includes billions of dollars to support Ukraine and for security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine, among other priorities,\u201d CNN reported at the time. The vote was 70-29, and included 22 Republicans, among them, McConnell.\n\n\u201cEvery day that the national security supplemental stands as a Senate-passed bill and not a law is the day that America\u2019s adversaries smile,\u201d McConnell declared in a five-minute speech Tuesday on the Senate floor (video below). \u201cThe decision before Congress both in annual appropriations as well as the supplemental are about more than Ukraine or Israel. They are about whether America has the will to defend our interests and uphold our influence.\u201d\n\nPunchbowl News senior congressional reporter Andrew Desiderio called McConnell\u2019s remarks an \u201cimplicit jab at Johnson \u2014 though not by name.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Target on the Back of Every Brown Person\u2019: SCOTUS Slammed for \u2018Show Me Your Papers\u2019 Ruling\n\nMcConnell also warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201con track to pass Joseph Stalin as the longest ruling despot in modern Russian history.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the past two years, Putin has sacrifice tens of thousands of his countrymen on the altar of an obscene neo-Soviet fantasy of Stalinist empire building. The human cost of Russia\u2019s war progression to Russians and Ukrainians alike is truly treacherous.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that \u201cformer Russian President Medvedev laid out exactly how Putin intends for his lawless conquest to end. Here\u2019s what he said: The entire territory of Ukraine is the territory of the Russian Federation. As he sees it Ukraine\u2019s complete and unconditional surrender, full demilitarization and reparations to Russia will help forge a benevolent consensus of peace.\u201d\n\nMcConnell added that \u201cPutin and his allies are emboldened precisely because the West is hesitating, because America is hesitating. They\u2019re spelling out their true intentions because they sense that we might not have the resolve to actually resist them. Here\u2019s the truth. Russia is playing for keeps. It\u2019s set on subjugating its sovereign democracy. Whole hog. There is every reason to believe the war ends with a negotiated outcome, most wars do. But it\u2019s absurd and self defeating to insist on negotiations without preparing Ukraine to operate from a position of strength. Whether or when Putin ever decides to turn from his bid for total conquest to the negotiating table, it will be lethal Western assistance that determines what comes next.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Ramaswamy Eyed for Homeland Security Head if Trump Re-Elected: Report\n\n\u201cThat is why Congress does need to influence the eventual outcome of the conflict. What we do will determine whether an administration that wants to facilitate negotiations has the leverage to produce terms favorable to America and our allies. Our next move will either reaffirm America\u2019s global influence, or kneecap both Washington and Kyiv.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Congress does its job, it\u2019ll be American weapons in Ukrainian hands, and stronger forces and intense industrial capacity. here at home that determines what conclusions the world draws from the first major landmark in Europe since 1945.\u201d\n\nWatch below or at this link.",
