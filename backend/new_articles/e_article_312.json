The final tally was 390-9. All nine \u201cno\u201d votes were by Republicans.\n\nSponsored by Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Susan Wild, HR 149, \u201cCondemning the illegal abduction of children from Ukraine to the Russian Federation,\u201d had been introduced in February of 2023 and made its way to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where it sat for nearly nine months before being passed unanimously and sent to the full House for a vote. It is symbolic and does not order any funds or any actions.\n\nThe resolution gives a timeline of Russia\u2019s actions, including stating that \u201cRussian Forces attacked a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of 3 individuals and injuries to 17 other individuals,\u201d in March of 2022.\n\nREAD MORE: McConnell Rips Johnson Again Over Ukraine\n\nAlso in that month, it notes, \u201cthe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced that the Russian military had forcefully and illegally kidnapped 2,389 Ukrainian children from temporarily occupied areas of Ukraine.\u201d It adds that \u201con June 2, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that 200,000 children are among the Ukrainians who have been forcefully resettled in Russia,\u201d and states that \u201cforcibly transferring children of one group to another group is a violation of Article II(e) of the Genocide Convention,\u201d of which Russia is a signatory.\n\nThe resolution states that \u201cMaria Lvova-Belova, Children\u2019s Rights Commissioner for the President of Russia, admitted to kidnapping Ukrainian children and facilitating forced adoptions to Russian families.\u201d\n\nHorrifically, it adds, \u201con June 22, 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner has verified at that at least 320 children have been killed since Russia\u2019s renewed invasion began,\u201d and, \u201con June 16, 2022, Russian authorities announced that children born in occupied Ukrainian territories after the February 24, 2022, invasion will be deemed Russian citizens.\u201d\n\nThe resolution then states that the U.S. House of Representatives \u201cholds the Government of the Russian Federation, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, responsible for the wrongful and illegal kidnapping of children from Ukraine and officially condemns these actions in the strongest terms.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Ramaswamy Eyed for Homeland Security Head if Trump Re-Elected: Report\n\nIt also states the House \u201cclaims that the Russian Federation is attempting to wipe out a generation of Ukrainian children, thereby crippling Ukraine\u2019s ability to nurture the next generation of Ukrainian citizens and leaders and to rebuild their country after Russia\u2019s unprovoked war, with the purpose of demolishing Ukraine\u2019s unique language, culture, history, and identity.\u201d\n\nThe nine House Republicans who voted no are:\n\nAndy Biggs (AZ), Eric Burlison (MO), Warren Davidson (OH), Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA), Clay Higgins (LA), Thomas Massie (KY), Matt Rosendale (MT), Chip Roy (TX) and Tom Tiffany (WI).\n\n(Links in bold above lead to NCRM\u2019s coverage of those specific lawmakers.)\n\nAll but two, Greene and Massie, are believed to be members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus. Congresswoman Greene was reportedly kicked out last year. All nine have received a grade of \u201cF\u201d from Republicans for Ukraine.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Easy Mark\u2019: Why Trump\u2019s $464M Bond Failure Makes Him a \u2018Massive National Security Risk\u2019",
