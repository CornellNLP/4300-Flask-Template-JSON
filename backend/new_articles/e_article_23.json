It will fill a critical electricity generation gap following Pennsylvania\u2019s largest coal plant\u2018s closure in July 2023.\n\nRenewables developer Swift Current Energy (SCE) will build a utility-scale 402 MW solar farm capable of producing enough clean energy to power 75,000 homes. SCE says on Mineral Basin\u2019s website that it\u2019s considering adopting offsite battery energy storage for the project.\n\nMineral Basin will serve as a pilot for SCE, which plans to develop around 1,000 MW of solar on former coal mine sites in the Appalachian region over the next five years.\n\nThe federal funding for the solar farm was announced today by the US Department of Energy and came from money already earmarked by the Biden administration\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nSecretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said, \u201cThanks to the President\u2019s Investing in America agenda, DOE is helping deploy clean energy solutions on current and former mine land across the country \u2013 supporting jobs and economic development in the areas hit hardest by our evolving energy landscape.\u201d\n\nThe project expects to create more than 750 construction jobs and six operations jobs, while providing $1.1 million in annual tax revenue to townships, the county, and local school district.\n\nConstruction on Pennsylvania\u2019s largest solar farm could begin this summer, and it\u2019s expected to come online by the second half of 2026. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) awarded it a 20-year power purchase agreement in November 2023.\n\nMineral Basin Solar Power, LLC, says it will invest nearly $20 million in economic development to create opportunities for young people and adults who want to upskill, right-skill, and reskill across high-demand sectors in the 27-county region.\n\nTo limit power outages and make your home more resilient, consider going solar with a battery storage system.
