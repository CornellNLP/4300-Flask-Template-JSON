The bank\u2019s research report, published on Tuesday, highlights that the next eight months leading up to the election are likely to be particularly disruptive for investors.\n\n\u201cThere are significant market implications arising from the stark contrast in the policies promulgated by the two candidates for president,\u201d the bank wrote.\n\nThe report outlines four potential election outcomes and their potential impact on the stock market:\n\nBlue Sweep: A complete democratic takeover could lead to a corporate tax hike and increased regulatory pressures, potentially negatively impacting equities.\n\nBiden wins, Congress splits: This scenario, similar to the current legislative setup, could result in a muted market impact.\n\nSee Also: Biden\u2019s Approval Rating Hits Rock Bottom As Inflation Victory Claim Fails To Resonate: Poll Analyst Sees \u2018Political Peril\u2019 For President\n\nLoading...

However, Trump\u2019s trade policies could counteract these gains.\n\nTrump wins, Congress splits: Under this scenario, financial markets would experience less tailwinds, but regulation would still be looser than under Biden.\n\nWhy It Matters: The 2024 presidential election has been a major focus for investors, with the stock market potentially being influenced by the political climate, as experts have suggested.\n\nThe election year has also seen a record-high stock market, with both Biden and Trump attributing this to their potential return to the White House.\n\nHowever, the stock market, which has been on a record-breaking spree, may be on the verge of a correction, according to a leading research firm. Ned Davis Research (NDR) has cautioned that the current market conditions could lead to a correction, although a bear market is not imminent. When this excessive optimism wanes and the sentiment composite dips into neutral mode, the MSCI ACWI tends to decline, NDR said. \u201c[W]ith the one-year and four-year cycles becoming less favorable, a correction can be expected,\u201d NDR added.\n\nRead Next: Hedge Fund Manager Says Republicans Are Committing \u2018Political Suicide\u2019 Ahead Of 2024 Election\u2026 Here\u2019s Why\n\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump.
