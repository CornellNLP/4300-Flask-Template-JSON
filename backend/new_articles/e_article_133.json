    "text": "By Jeff Mason\n\nDALLAS (Reuters) \u2013 U.S. President Joe Biden assailed Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz in his home state on Thursday as part of a fundraising tour that has raised millions for Biden\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nBiden, at a fundraiser at the Dallas home of lawyer Russell Budd, urged donors to support U.S. Representative Colin Allred, the Democratic nominee for the Senate seat held by Cruz.\n\n\u201cThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher across the board. And with your help, we\u2019re going to win up and down the ticket, and that includes here in Texas,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to elect Colin as your next senator\u2026 so Ted Cruz joins another loser, Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said, referring to his likely Republican opponent in the November presidential election.\n\nBudd announced that the event, the first of two fundraisers for Biden in Texas Thursday evening, raised $2.5 million, adding to the tally collected by Biden this week on a Western swing. Biden\u2019s campaign raised more than $53 million in February and reported it has $155 million cash on hand.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign reported Wednesday it had raised $10.9 million in February.\n\nCruz, who lost the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, has been a frequent Biden critic, particularly on Biden\u2019s handling of migration along the Texas border with Mexico.\n\nPolls show a tight race between Cruz and Allred, a former professional football player and House Representative.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Steve Holland; Editing by Heather Timmons and Gerry Doyle)",
