This time around, its CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and storage) project along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico is for CO2 capture and sequestration including those from third parties, he noted.\n\nWoods admitted that IRA financial incentives are enabling CCUS projects to be economically viable, but said: \"I am not a big fan of government subsidies\" as they tend not to be sustainable in the long run.\n\nExxonMobil has also started to look into extracting lithium from brine, as its technical team has found a potentially economically viable level of lithium in the produced water in its operations, Woods said. He also claimed that ExxonMobil's operations in the Permian Basin are \"well on its way to achieving net-zero emissions by 2030.\"\n\nShell CEO Wael Sawan said the British energy giant is trying to further play its role in gas and global LNG, as Europe is reducing its dependence on Russian pipeline gas.\n\nShell is trying to \"stabilize oil production\" and streamlining its investment in renewable energy, Sawan added, stressing the firm's strength in energy integration as an efficient producer of renewable energy.\n\nCERAWeek, known as the Super Bowl in the global energy industry, draws over 9,000 government, industry and academic leaders from more than 80 countries and regions this year, according to the organizer S&P Global. It will run till Friday. \u25a0\n\nEditor: \u987e\u601d\u57df",
