( The lawsuit )\n\nToday's topic.\n\nThe 32-hour workweek. Last Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced a bill to federally mandate a 32-hour workweek. Sanders\u2019s bill is the Senate companion to a bill introduced by Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) in the House, the Thirty-Two Hour Workweek Act , which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to reduce the standard workweek from 40 hours to 32, lowering the maximum hours threshold for overtime pay for non-exempt employees. Those exempt would include computer professionals, farmworkers, sales employees, and many other occupations . The proposal follows the United Auto Workers (UAW) strikes in the fall, where one of the labor demands was for a 32-hour workweek.\n\nTakano, a senior member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, credits technological advances , especially in artificial intelligence, with increasing efficiency enough to allow workers to put in less time to produce the same results. \u201cWe have choices to make as a society about whether we are going to allow technology to put us in the service of it or whether it really serves all of us, and I mean all of us,\u201d Takano said.\n\nSanders garnered attention for his bill last week with a hearing in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which he chairs. He said the proposed worktime reductions would be phased in over four years. \u201cDo we continue the trend that technology only benefits the people on top, or do we demand that these transformational changes benefit working people?\" Sanders asked.\n\nThe proposal faced both support and opposition in the hearing . \"If this policy is implemented, it would threaten the millions of small businesses already operating on razor-thin margins, in part because they are unable to find enough workers,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA). \"Employers would be forced to eliminate full-time positions in favor of part-time ones.\"\n\nA recent survey from Morning Consult found that 87% of employed U.S. adults would be interested in a four-day workweek. However, the Senate bill is not likely to gain the necessary 60 votes to pass the divided Senate, nor is Takano\u2019s bill expected to pass a Republican-controlled House. The 32-hour workweek faces stiff opposition not just from most Republicans but also from some financial experts , who say that the proposed changes could hurt blue-collar workers and manufacturing industries. Other economists , though, argue that a shortened workweek would improve worker productivity.\n\nA recent pilot study of 61 companies in the United Kingdom found that a four-day workweek significantly increased employee morale, decreased burnout, and improved employee retention. 92% of companies who participated in the pilot program voluntarily adopted a 32-hour workweek.\n\nSome economists have cast doubt on the results of the UK study, noting that it wasn\u2019t peer-reviewed and participating companies shortened the workweek by only 7% on average. Others suggest that these pilot programs tend to only include employers who were already inclined to try a shorter week, limiting the accuracy of their findings.\n\nToday we\u2019ll take a look at the arguments about the proposal from the right and left, then I\u2019ll give my take.\n\nWhat the right is saying.\n\nThe right opposes the proposal, arguing it\u2019s out of touch with economic reality.\n\nSome say it would cause costs to rise for everyone.\n\nOthers suggest working fewer hours won\u2019t make workers happier.\n\nNational Review\u2019s editors wrote about \u201cBernie\u2019s 32-hour work week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is Sanders\u2019s plan to contribute to the great human endeavor of becoming wealthier while working less? Does he have an idea for the next automobile, a better management strategy, or the power loom for the 22nd century?,\u201d the editors asked. \u201cNo, Sanders wants to write words on a page and have a couple hundred people vote for it\u2026 That\u2019s Sanders\u2019s idea of progress. Pass a law that says everyone gets paid the same for doing less work, and then it happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could easily produce 1950s levels of output only working a few hours per week. But that would mean 1950s levels of technology, 1950s levels of poverty, 1950s levels of housing, 1950s levels of air-conditioning, 1950s levels of food quality and variety \u2014 and it turns out nobody really wants that. So we keep working, and innovating, so we can be better off, not just as well off,\u201d the editors wrote. \u201cMaybe if you\u2019re an 82-year-old socialist who has only worked in politics your entire life, you lose touch with what it means to be a productive member of society.\u201d\n\nIn The Washington Examiner, Brad Polumbo said \u201cBernie Sanders unveils his latest insane idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might sound dreamy, but like so many of Sanders\u2019s bold plans that promise to make everything better with no meaningful downsides, it\u2019s actually a harebrained idea that would backfire tremendously,\u201d Polumbo wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Any economic change has significant trade-offs, and you can\u2019t get around them just by writing legislation that says everything has to work out great for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis change would constitute an enormous increase in costs for many employers and businesses. And it\u2019s just basic economics that when businesses\u2019 costs go up, they have to raise their prices. Workers aren\u2019t actually going to be better off if everything they consume gets more expensive. Regardless, while the federal government could try to prohibit employers from reducing current workers\u2019 wages in light of this legislation, that wouldn\u2019t really work. After all, employers will still presumably be free to offer lower wages for all new hires.\u201d\n\nIn PJ Media, Rick Moran asked \u201cwould reducing the workweek to 32 hours make workers happier?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's no doubt this would be a popular piece of legislation with many workers. And Sanders, surprisingly, makes some good points about why the change would be beneficial,\u201d Moran said. But \u201cthere is absolutely no empirical evidence that a shorter workweek relieves stress and makes workers happier\u2026 however many hours an employee puts in, the work has to get done. I doubt whether relieving stress levels would be measurable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWork has, indeed, changed radically. There is a lot less physical exertion, and, in fact, machines do most of our heavy lifting and thinking. To relieve stress, I suggest looking at home life as well. There are far more stressors at home than in most workplaces. And a 32-hour workweek isn't going to fix that,\u201d Moran added. \u201cThis proposal would sound the death knell of American economic supremacy. Let's make sure we understand that before taking the leap to a 32-hour workweek.\u201d\n\nWhat the left is saying.\n\nThe left is mixed on the proposal, with supporters arguing it\u2019s a necessary move for a modern workforce.\n\nSome disagree, saying companies will make this change themselves if it\u2019s truly in workers\u2019 best interest.\n\nOthers say the proposal\u2019s growing popularity shows our changing societal values.\n\nIn The Washington Post, Sen. Bernie Sanders and United Auto Workers president Shawn Fain made \u201cthe case for a 32-hour workweek with no loss in pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, American workers are more than 400 percent more productive than they were in the 1940s. And yet, despite this fact, millions of our people are working longer hours for lower wages. In fact, 28.5 million Americans now work over 60 hours a week, and more than half of full-time employees work more than 40 hours a week,\u201d Sanders and Fain said. \u201cDespite these long hours, the average worker in America makes almost $50 a week less than he or she did 50 years ago, after adjusting for inflation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink about all the incredible advancements in technology \u2014 computers, robotics, artificial intelligence \u2014 and the huge increase in worker productivity that has been achieved. What have been the results of these changes for working people? Almost all the economic gains have gone straight to the top, while wages for workers are stagnant or worse,\u201d Sanders and Fain wrote. \u201cWhile CEOs are making nearly 400 times as much as their average employees, many workers are seeing their family lives fall apart\u2026 This should not be happening in the United States of America in 2024.\u201d\n\nIn Inc. Magazine, Suzanne Lucas said \u201cno matter how popular this bill seems, the chances of it becoming law are slim to none.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanders says he wants to pass this 4-day workweek bill to force companies to share profits with their employees and bring Americans into line with other wealthy nations,\u201d Lucas wrote. \u201cEmployees in other countries may look like they work a lot fewer hours per week--workers in Copenhagen, Denmark, for instance, clock in at 1,380 hours per year, which is a dramatic difference. But they also have a standard 37-hour work week, with an average of 33 hours per week actually worked\u2014a 3.4-hour difference.\n\n\u201cWhy is the overall number so much lower? Vacation. Danes are entitled to a minimum of five weeks of vacation per year for full-time employees. Most Europeans enjoy real time off like this. U.S. law doesn't have any mandatory vacations, although some states require paid sick time,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cMany people want to work fewer hours, but businesses tend to want full-time employees to work 40 hours\u2026 If this is truly better for everyone, companies will adopt it on their own. No new law needed.\u201d\n\nIn The New York Times, Binyamin Appelbaum called the 32-hour workweek \u201cthe magic number.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans spend too much time on the job. A shorter workweek would be better for our health, better for our families and better for our employers, who would reap the benefits of a more motivated and better-rested work force. Other countries may seek an advantage in the global marketplace by wringing every drop of labor from their workers; American companies have to be more productive, and that means taking better care of their workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the 40-hour week may feel like an immutable law of nature, it\u2019s barely a century old. American workers fought to establish the eight-hour workday around the turn of the last century, campaigning on the catchy slogan \u2018Eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what you will,\u2019\u201d Appelbaum wrote. \u201cThe revival of the idea partly reflects a shift in societal priorities. Americans have become more protective of their health, more inclined to define themselves in terms of their lives outside work \u2014 and perhaps more willing to accept leisure as a substitute for higher pay.\u201d\n\nMy take.\n\nReminder: \"My take\" is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion. If you have feedback, criticism, or compliments, don't unsubscribe. Write in by replying to this email, or leave a comment.\n\nIt\u2019ll never pass, but there are good reasons to adopt a 32-hour workweek.\n\nIf you have a business that can get the same amount of productivity for less time, then go for it.\n\nBut not all businesses can, so I don\u2019t think this proposal makes sense as a piece of top-down federal legislation.\n\nI just don\u2019t see how a 32-hour workweek can happen.\n\nSanders\u2019s proposal is not going to make it through a divided Senate, and Takano\u2019s is essentially dead on arrival in the House. The federal government isn\u2019t going to enact a 32-hour workweek, and I don\u2019t think it should. But that doesn\u2019t mean the idea is totally without merit, either.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what the proposal gets right. Workers are more productive now and are getting paid less \u2014 Sanders isn\u2019t pulling those numbers out of thin air. According to the St. Louis Fed, worker productivity since 1955 has increased by about 400% , and over the same period average inflation-adjusted income has decreased \u2014 despite income inequality dropping in the last year.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that other countries do require fewer hours per week. Denmark, for example, has a 37-hour workweek , as well as more maternity and paternity leave and a culture where more paid time off is expected. And there is evidence to suggest that companies that enact a four-day workweek can maintain the same level of productivity with happier and healthier employees.\n\nIn simple terms, the proposal makes sense. Technological advances have helped workers make productivity gains and helped companies make more money, but the amount that workers get paid per time worked hasn\u2019t increased. Instead of fixing that by making hourly pay go up, why not keep their pay the same and make the number of hours go down? Workers who make enough would be happier because they would spend less time at work, those who don\u2019t make enough would have more time for a second job; and if companies get the same level of productivity, then what\u2019s the problem?\n\nThat brings us to what the proposal gets wrong. First, I don\u2019t see how this helps with worker wages. If we make it so full-time workers are making the same amount a year but are just working less, how is that putting more money in the pockets of most Americans? You could argue that it frees them up for more part-time work, but like Sanders said, a lot of people who need the money are already working second jobs. I can see the argument that working less is just better for health and stress levels, and that\u2019s fine, but I don\u2019t think you can really argue it\u2019s better for the average person\u2019s bottom line.\n\nIn fact, it might be worse. A shortened workweek might make sense for white-collar workplaces, but I don\u2019t see how it makes sense for manufacturing or construction companies. Imagine a construction company where 50 employees are paid a fixed amount for 40 hours a week. If suddenly that company has to pay the same employees for 32 hours of work instead, what do you think will happen? Either 50 employees are going to get eight hours of overtime pay, increasing the cost of construction at a time when housing prices are at all-time highs, or 100 employees are going to work 20 hours a week \u2014 meaning 50 people lose their benefits while 50 newer, less efficient workers are brought on, also without benefits. Either way, an increase in housing costs or a decrease in worker benefits isn\u2019t a good outcome.\n\nThe U.K. pilot study of 61 companies quoted so often by 32-hour workweek supporters reflects this problem, too. Of those companies, seven were in manufacturing and construction, and none of the construction companies were quoted or showcased in the report. Meanwhile, only one manufacturing company \u2014 a craft brewery \u2014 was highlighted.\n\nThat study had other problems, too. First off, it isn\u2019t definitive. Other studies have shown that the length of the workweek isn\u2019t behind most workplace issues. It also wasn\u2019t peer-reviewed, it was financed by an organization called \u201c4 Day Week Global\u201d (meaning its methods are likely biased), it included only organizations interested in adopting a four-day workweek (biasing its results further), and it only collected data about stress levels at the workplace. While trying to mitigate stress is a worthy cause, there\u2019s not much evidence that the number of hours we work is a significant driver: About 75% of U.S. adults reported experiencing stress in their lives, while in Scandinavian countries \u2014 where it\u2019s more common to work fewer hours \u2014 it\u2019s closer to 80% .\n\nSimply put, I don\u2019t think legislating a top-down 32-hour workweek is going to be a magic bullet to eliminate stress, I don\u2019t think it makes for smart policy, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be good for every industry \u2014 or for every company in the industries where it could work best. I know that with the amount of work we have to do every week at Tangle, I\u2019m not exactly champing at the bit to try it out.\n\nBut I could see it working for a lot of other places. Advertising agencies, law firms, even small businesses and storefronts \u2014 if you can actually achieve the same amount of productivity for less work, then you should by all means do it. And I think Sanders and Takano mainstreaming this issue and making it part of a broader discussion could result in that change coming faster to those workplaces where it makes sense. Then maybe, down the road, it would make sense in more and more industries.\n\nI just don\u2019t think we\u2019re there now. Like another signature Sanders position, the $15 federal minimum wage he ran on in 2016 , I think it\u2019s a nice talking point that makes sense for some industries but wouldn\u2019t make sense as a matter of overarching federal policy. Until more U.S. companies try this out across every sector, there just isn\u2019t enough reason to support a government-mandated change of this magnitude.\n\nTake the poll: What do you think of the 32-hour workweek?

Sounds like a no win!\n\n\u2014 Ray from Staunton, Virginia\n\nTangle: A lot of the issues we cover have moderate positions to stake out that take elements from each side of a debate. Some issues are ones where moderate positions are still very possible, but maintaining a consistent viewpoint makes it hard to meet in the middle. Abortion is one of those issues. Taxation is another.\n\nIf you believe that we are better off with less government, that means you want to see lower taxes, fewer agencies and employees, and fewer investments in government services and entitlement programs. If you believe in more government, that means more taxation, more federal workers, and more investment in government services and entitlement programs.\n\nI think that\u2019s where your second point actually provides a really good visualization. There\u2019s an economic concept called the Laffer Curve , which says that the more you tax a population the less prosperous the people are, meaning that over time you actually get less from them. It also means the opposite \u2014 the less you tax a population, the less you get in taxes. So, in theory, there\u2019s a happy medium of ideal taxation. But every increase in taxation past that point gives diminishing returns, and actually hurts the population.\n\nI don\u2019t disagree at all with that. And to be honest, I\u2019m more ideologically prone towards smaller government and less taxation. But I also understand the point of view of people who disagree with me, and I think their best point answers your first question: Why tax the rich, when the top 1% earn 22% of income but make up 42% of our tax revenue ?\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s not really a bad thing that we tax richer people more, because the same idea behind the Laffer Curve for the government is also at play for individuals \u2014 every extra dollar you earn past a certain point gives diminishing returns, so it\u2019s better to put a higher tax on the dollars people need less. Second, despite income inequality going down in 2023, it\u2019s still extremely high in historical terms, and a more progressive tax is a pretty good tool for addressing it.\n\nFrom my point of view, the big question is how to effectively tax the ultra-wealthy, who amass their fortunes not from salaries but from stock benefits and investments. Those are hard to tax , and they should be. But in a country where the 400 richest people own as much wealth as the bottom 60% combined, and where their fortunes are almost unimaginable , you\u2019re going to see a lot of popular interest in progressively taxing the people who earn significantly more in a year than most people will ever see in a lifetime.\n\nWant to have a question answered in the newsletter?

CrowdTangle was a driving force behind the controversy over Facebook\u2019s algorithms in the lead-up to the 2020 election, with journalists leveraging its data to show the site was promoting hyper-political content. The move comes despite Meta facing calls for greater transparency in how it handles content moderation, and the company says it will offer improved research tools \u2014 like its new Meta Content Library \u2014 to address these concerns. But news publishers, journalists, or anyone with commercial interests will not be granted access to that data and will have to rely on third-party tools to analyze Meta\u2019s platforms.
