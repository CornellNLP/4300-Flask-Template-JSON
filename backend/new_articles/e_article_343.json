It has about $42 million in cash on hand.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden\u2019s campaign operation raised roughly $53 million in February, which gave it $155 million in cash on hand entering March.\n\n\u201cWe are two weeks into the general election and Donald Trump can\u2019t raise money, is hiding at his country club, and is letting convicts and conspiracy theorists take over his campaign. That is not a winning strategy,\u201d Biden spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\nThe campaign mocked Trump and questioned if \u201ctrailing your opponent in cash on hand by nearly 4 to 1 and hitting up donors to help cover your own personal debts instead of funding your campaign [is] a winning formula for November?\u201d\n\nIt touted that Biden is traveling to every battleground state in March, while Trump held a rally in Ohio and has been at his home in Florida. And it argued that Trump is \u201cbad\u201d at messaging after he suggested that the U.S. look at potential cuts to entitlement programs, which he has since walked back.\n\nThe campaign taunted Trump earlier Thursday over his low fundraising numbers, saying that the former president would \u201cfire himself\u201d if he put up these kinds of numbers on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.\n\nNews Related",
