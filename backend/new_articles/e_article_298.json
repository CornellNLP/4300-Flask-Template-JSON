    "text": "Post-Presidency\n\n03.16.2024 Defended Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, whose email address was used to create an account on Adult Friend Finder in 2008 seeking \u201cmen for 1-on-1 sex.\u201d Moreno\u2019s campaign said the account was created by an intern as a prank. Trump defended Moreno and claimed \u201cDemocratic fake treatment\u201d for the story Moreno\u2019s campaign had confirmed: \u201cWe all know this man. He\u2019s a hero, he\u2019s a winner and we\u2019re not going to let these people \u2014 these people are sick.\u201d\n\n03.16.2024 Appeared at a campaign rally for Ohio Senate primary candidate Bernie Moreno, sponsored by the pro-Moreno Buckeye Values PAC. The PAC released an ad targeting a Moreno rival as \u201ca champion for trans equality.\u201d The PAC also reportedly sent campaign mail asking \u201cWhat Team Does Frank LaRose Play For?\u201d and \u201cIs he with us \u2026 Or is he with they/them?\u201d\n\n03.04.2024 Endorsed North Carolina Lt. Governor Mark Robinson for governor, despite Robinson\u2019s history of anti-LGBTQ disinformation and rhetoric, including calling gay people \u201cfilth\u201d and \u201cmaggots.\u201d Trump repeated his past claims that Robinson is \u201cbetter than Martin Luther King\u201d and \u201cMartin Luther King on steroids.\u201d\n\n02.02.2024 Used vulgar slang to refer to LGBTQ legal icon Roberta Kaplan, who represented E. Jean Carroll against Trump. Trump was found liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the 1990s and for defaming her by mocking her claims after he left the White House. A jury awarded Carroll with $83 million in damages. Kaplan recalled leading the deposition of Trump, saying that at the end Trump\u2019s lawyers asked to go \u201coff the record,\u201d meaning what he said would not be included on the court deposition transcript. Kaplan said Trump then said to her: \u201cSee you next Tuesday,\u201d a slang term referring to a word for female genitalia used as an insult for women.\n\n02.20.2024 Supported by the anti-LGBTQ national organization Heritage Foundation with a 180-page document detailing regulations and executive orders to be taken in first days in office, including: \u201cdeleting [from federal agencies and federal rule] the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\u201cSOGI\u201d), diversity, equity, and inclusion., gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights;\u201d limiting abortion access with executive orders using the Comstock Act \u2014 a long-inactive 19th century law that banned birth control and abortion medication by mail. Semafor reported: While Project 2025 bills itself as being \u201ccandidate agnostic,\u201d [project director Paul] Dans noted that at this point in the primary, they expect \u201cand hope\u201d that Donald Trump will ultimately end up in office again. NBC News reported that Project 2025 includes representatives from anti-LGBTQ, anti-equality and anti-democracy groups \u201cled by veterans of the Trump administration, such as America First Legal, the Center for Renewing America and the Conservative Partnership Institute, the Claremont Institute, the Family Research Council and the Independent Women\u2019s Forum.\u201d (Links to groups added by GLAAD).\n\n01.10.2024 Boasted of his role in the Supreme Court decision ending the right to abortion by nominating three of the justices who joined the decision: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, with Roe v. Wade, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about this stuff. For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it and I\u2019m proud to have done it,\u201d Trump said. Abortion is an LGBTQ issue: LGBTQ people can and do get pregnant, lesbian young women are two to ten times more likely to become pregnant than heterosexual youth, lesbian and bisexual women are often at higher risk of sexual assault due in part to their sexual orientation, which may also result in an unplanned pregnancy.\n\n12.30.2023 Criticized Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine for vetoing state bill banning essential health care for transgender youth and banning trans youth from school sports, spread disinformation about the care and school sports. DeWine had said his veto was based on conversations he had with parents, patients and providers who told him how the care saves lives. Trump said in a Truth Social post: \u201cDeWine has fallen to the Radical Left\u2026 What was he thinking. The bill would have stopped child mutilation, and prevented men from playing in women\u2019s sports. Legislature will hopefully overturn. Do it FAST!!!\u201d Ohio hospitals and providers, along with hundreds of others, had testified that they do not perform surgeries on youth, and Ohio\u2019s school sports association has long had policies to ensure inclusive participation of transgender students.\n\n12.17.2023 Announced on social media, \u201cOn Day One [of a second term if he were reelected President], I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing Critical Race Theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children\u2026\u201d\n\n11.03.2023 Mimicked a Canadian weightlifter in an extended campaign event skit to mock and misgender transgender women in sports, claiming he will \u201cend this on day one\u201d if he\u2019s re-elected.\n\n05.17.2023 Proudly stated, \u201cI was able to kill Roe v. Wade,\u201d taking credit for the Supreme Court overturning the national right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision. The Dobbs decision suggested that the right to same-sex marriage should be reconsidered by the Court as well.\n\n06.11.2023 Said of transgender athletes at a rally, \u201cWho would even think that you can allow this? Who would say that this is okay? These people are sick. They are deranged\u2026. It\u2019s astonishing how passionately people react to that. When you talk about tax cuts, they remain calm. But when you mention transgender issues, everyone goes wild. Who would have imagined five years ago that they wouldn\u2019t even know what \u2018it\u2019 meant?\u201d\n\n04.14.2023 Said that if re-elected, he would use the government to investigate and potentially halt transgender health care during a National Rifle Association (NRA) speech. \u201cUpon my inauguration, I will direct the FDA to convene an independent outside panel to investigate whether transgender hormone treatments and ideology increase the risk of extreme depression, aggression and even violence,\u201d said Trump. He also accused Democrats of \u201cpushing the transgender cult\u201d on children.\n\n03.26.2023 Vowed to crack down on \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d and pledged to \u201crevoke every Biden policy promoting the disfigurement of our youth\u201d at the first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign. He said that he would \u201ckeep men out of women\u2019s sports\u201d if re-elected president, after he last year misgendered transgender athlete Lia Thomas. He added: \u201cI will immediately sign an executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d\n\n01.31.2023 Made multiple false claims about gender affirming care, tweeting a so-called \u201cPlan to Protect Children from Left-Wing Gender Insanity.\u201c Every major medical association and world health authority supports gender affirming care; statements here including from the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cThere is strong consensus among the most prominent medical organizations worldwide that evidence-based, gender-affirming care for transgender children and adolescents is medically necessary and appropriate. It can even be lifesaving. The decision of whether and when to start gender-affirming treatment, which does not necessarily lead to hormone therapy or surgery, is personal and involves careful consideration by each patient and their family.\u201d\n\n01.29.2023 At a campaign event, falsely claimed and without evidence or fact: \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop the left-wing radical racists and perverts who are trying to indoctrinate our youth, and we\u2019re going to get their Marxist hands off our children\u2026We\u2019re going to defeat the cult of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders: men and women. We\u2019re not going to allow men to play women\u2019s sports.\u201d\n\n01.26.2023 Released so-called education policy that cuts federal funding for any school or program that includes \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.\u201d\n\n11.15.2022 In speech announcing third run for president, baselessly targeted schools for \u201cradical civics and gender insanity\u201d (without defining what those are) and stated inaccurate and inflammatory promises such as \u201cWe will not let men, as an example, participate in women\u2019s sports.\u201d Recommitted to his 2017 tweeted ban against transgender Americans serving in the military: \u201cAs commander-in-chief, I will get Biden\u2019s radical left ideology out of our military.\u201d President Biden reversed the tweeted order in 2021 in one of his first acts as President. 70% of Americans support allowing transgender Americans to serve in the U.S. armed forces. 66% of active-duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines support serving alongside transgender personnel.\n\n08.06.22 Invited activist Riley Gaines on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) as he baselessly claimed that \u201cleft-wing lunatics\u201d encourage unfair competition in sports. Gaines has profited by spreading disinformation about transgender people and athletes after tying for 5th place with a transgender swimmer at the NCAA championships. Gaines went on to endorse Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president over Trump.\n\n03.01.22 Told a gay supporter they did not \u201clook gay\u201d during a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cWhere\u2019s Gays for Trump?\u201d Trump asked a crowd of supporters at the event which was raising funds for congressional candidate John Gibbs. Someone replied, \u201cWe\u2019re over here.\u201d Trump pointed at them and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look gay,\u201d which elicited laughs from the audience.\n\n02.24.22 Praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying at a Florida fundraiser, he is \u201cpretty smart\u2026 He\u2019s taken over a country for $2 worth of sanctions\u2026 taking over a country\u2014really a vast, vast location, a great piece of land with a lot of people\u2014and just walking right in.\u201d In fact the sanctions include: freezing the global banking assets of Putin, various government officials, and some oligarchs; immobilizing the assets of the Russian Central Bank and cutting off Russian banks from business with the U.S.; removing Russia from SWIFT which handles about 70% of Russian banking transactions; barring any new oil and gas deals with Russia; and other sanctions. The effect has been to shrink the Russian economy 35% in the second quarter of 2022 and 7% for the entire year. Despite being outsized and out resourced, Ukraine has stymied or slowed much of the Russian invasion effort. The autocrat Trump praised as \u201cpretty smart,\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin, signed legislation on 2013 to ban the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relations to minors,\u201d which, writes Human Rights Watch, is \u201ca reference universally understood to mean a ban on providing children access to information about LGBT people\u2019s lives\u2026 The law has been used to shut down websites that provide valuable information and services to teens across Russia and to bar LGBT support groups from working with youth. But the law\u2019s effects have been much broader: Individual mental health professionals have curtailed what they say and what support they give to students, and the law gives the strong imprimatur of the Russian state to the false and discriminatory view that LGBT people are a threat to tradition and the family\u2026 Its passage coincided with an uptick in often-gruesome vigilante violence against LGBT people in Russia\u2014frequently carried out in the name of protecting Russian values and Russia\u2019s children.\u201d Putin signed legislation in 2021 to constitutionally ban same-sex marriage in Russia.\n\n02.28.21 Told a crowd of supporters that he did not believe transgender women and girls should compete on sports teams consistent with their gender identity, referring to trans female athletes as \u201cbiological males,\u201d a term often used by anti-trans activists to suggest transgender people are not who they say they are.\n\nPresidency\n\n01.08.21 The day after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a deadly rampage, HHS went public with a final rule to rescind regulations barring discrimination against LGBTQ Americans seeking to adopt or be adopted, or health services including HIV prevention.\n\n12.07.20 Labor Department, led by Secretary Eugene Scalia, announces rule-change implementation to allow federal contractors to discriminate against LGBTQ workers via religious exemption. The rule change takes effect Jan. 8, with 12 days remaining in the Trump administration, and will require a full rule-change process for the new administration to revise.\n\n10.24.20 Report shows U.S. State Department has been omitting information about human rights abuses against LGBTQ and intersex people, as well as information about violence against women and girls. The Asylum Research Center report from the UK says there\u2019s concern the omissions will result in the erasure of abuses used to make asylum claims and decisions, with LGBTQI+ people being returned to dangerous home countries.\n\n10.17.20 Department of Education pressures New Hampshire\u2019s Franklin Pierce University to drop its trans-inclusive policy in athletics. The university agreed to rescind its policy permitting transgender athletes to compete consistent with their gender identity to avoid an investigation by the DOE\u2019s Office of Civil Rights. A civil rights complaint triggering the threat of an investigation was filed by \u201cConcerned Women for America,\u201d a noted anti-LGBTQ hate group.\n\n10.17.20 Tiffany Trump appears at campaign event, falsely claims her father supports the LGBTQ community, ignoring his and his administration\u2019s record of hundreds of attacks against the community. She also omits the \u201cT\u201d when saying \u201cLGBTQ.\u201d The \u201cT\u201d stands for Transgender. LGBTQ advocates see Tiffany Trump\u2019s omission as another example of President Trump and his supporters failure to recognize and support trans people and their very existence.\n\n10.10.20 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, warned by his advance team that an event with the anti-gay Florida Family Policy Council had homophobic advertisements/flyers at the site and that the group promoted dangerous, debunked conversion therapy, appears at October 3 event anyway. State Dept. aides were reportedly appalled at the speaking event and that Pompeo touted it afterward, in a department-wide memo.\n\n10.05.20 On the first day of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u201ctake a legal baseball bat\u201d to the court\u2019s 2015 decision legalizing marriage equality, claiming the decision \u201cenables courts and governments to brand religious adherents who believe marriage equality is between one man and one woman as bigots.\u201d Justice Thomas writes that Kim Davis, the public official who had refused to issue marriage licenses based on her religious belief, is a \u201cvictim\u201d of a so-called \u201ccavalier treatment of religion.\u201d\n\n09.29.20 President Trump\u2019s son Eric claims that LGBTQ people \u201ccome out in full force\u201d to support his father. GLAAD releases a scientific poll of LGBTQ voters showing 76% support VP Joe Biden.\n\n09.26.20 Legal scholars conclude Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s resume could make her the most conservative new justice since Clarence Thomas. On gun rights\u2014would probably strike down \u201cred flag\u201d laws to temporarily take firearms away from dangerous people. She has \u201cvoiced skepticism about the Affordable Care Act. A \u201cdream candidate\u201d for conservatives focused on overturning abortion rights.\n\n09.26.20 President Trump nominates Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. In her speech, Barrett says she adheres to the same judicial philosophy as the late justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia, who dissented in cases advancing LGBTQ rights, called the Obergefell decision \u201ca threat to American democracy,\u201d and Barrett has similarly stated views against marriage equality, defended dissenters of Obergefell, and delivered speeches paid for by anti-LGBTQ groups. She was vetted for the Trump administration by The Federalist Society, which has argued against every major LGBTQ policy proposal including extending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to include LGBTQ workers, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, hate crimes legislation, \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d and transgender accommodations. At least 11 people at the White House event announcing Barrett later test positive for COVID-19, including President Trump, his wife, former senior adviser, press secretary, the president of Notre Dame University, and two members of the Judiciary Committee who say they will quarantine for ten days, then attend Barrett\u2019s confirmation hearing.\n\n09.18.20 Within an hour of the announcement of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announces \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\n09.18.20 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos vows to withhold federal funds from Connecticut school districts that participate in athletic conference allowing transgender athletes to compete consistent with their gender identity.The move to withhold about $18 million intended to help schools desegregate could have national implications for both transgender athletes and students of color.\n\n09.16.20 Trump administration deploys legal strategy to avoid enforcing The U.S. Supreme Court Bostock ruling extending protections for LGBTQ workers, pushing rules that allow shelters and schools to insist access be based only on gender assigned at birth.\n\n09.10.20 President Trump reveals additions to his list of potential Supreme Court appointees, which include Republican senators who have campaigned against marriage equality, a Trump-appointed federal judge with ties to an anti-LGBTQ organization identified as a hate group, and Trump\u2019s former Solicitor General who has filed briefs and argued before the Court to allow organizations to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Axios reports the list was partly motivated by the Court\u2019s ruling in June 2020 to expand LGBTQ protections in the workplace.\n\n09.08.20 The Trump administration files 36-page brief with Indiana Supreme Court to support a school\u2019s alleged right to fire a teacher for being gay.\n\n08.31.20 White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany falsely characterizes a State Department policy denying citizenship to children of same-sex couples born via surrogacy overseas. McEnany claimed the policy denied citizenship based solely on surrogacy when in fact only LGBTQ surrogacy families had been rejected. McEnany then read what she called the administration\u2019s LGBTQ \u201cachievements,\u201d a list she has previously read and which has been debunked as anti-LGBTQ.\n\n08.28.20 The Trump State Department says it\u2019s reviewing a federal judge\u2019s ruling with the Department of Justice, ordering State to issue a U.S. passport for the daughter of a married gay couple from Georgia and ruling her a citizen since birth. The judge had ruled the State Department policy requiring a biological connection raised serious constitutional questions for same-sex couples.\n\n08.24.20 The Washington Post gives Trump advisor Richard Grenell four Pinnochios for, \u201cThe absurd claim that Trump is the \u2018most pro-gay president in American history.\u2019\u201d The claims are deemed \u201cwhoppers,\u201d and every claim Grenell makes is discredited.\n\n08.21.20 The State Department is fighting a ruling to recognize citizenship of a young girl with gay parents. She was born in Canada via surrogate, and although her parents are legally married and U.S. citizens, the State Dept. argued in federal court she was \u201cborn out of wedlock\u201d and therefore not entitled to birthright citizenship. A judge deemed the controversial State policy unconstitutional in June.\n\n08.20.20 The lead U.S. foreign aid agency proposes a new policy on gender and women\u2019s empowerment that eliminates any mention of transgender people or contraceptives, running counter to its own long-standing practices in deciding what programs to support. The draft policy released by the U.S. Agency for International Development doesn\u2019t use the acronym LGBT or the words \u201clesbian,\u201d \u201cgay,\u201d \u201cbisexual,\u201d \u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201cidentity\u201d at all. Gender experts and advocates said the new policy falls far short of providing the expertise the agency needs to address gender issues in development.\n\n08.19.20 The Department of Health and Human Services has been systematically discriminating against LGBTQ+ families in federally supported foster care programs, according to a new report from the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee. The committee found that federally-funded agencies were granted a waiver to allow discrimination based on religion and sexual orientation, intentionally harming LGBTQ children, adults, and families.\n\n08.10.20 Jenna Ellis, Trump campaign senior legal adviser and the president\u2019s personal lawyer misgenders Pennsylvania\u2019s Health Secretary. Ellis, who has no apparent medical degree, uses Twitter to mock other efforts to control the pandemic that has killed 163,000 people on President Trump\u2019s watch. Ellis also condemns same-sex marriage and transgender identity, and has tweeted to promote conversion therapy.\n\n07.29.20 Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos visit a private school in Raleigh, NC, lauding its reopening for in-person education despite the coronavirus epidemic. Thales Academy founder Bob Luddy is one of the biggest Republican donors in North Carolina. Luddy also founded Franklin Academy, a Wake Forest charter school that changed its school handbook after criticism of rules prohibiting LGBT discussion or affirmation. Students protested Pence\u2019s visit with signs promoting LGBT rights and remote schooling. Within a week of Pence and DeVos\u2019 visit, students at a nearby sister school had to quarantine after a student tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n07.28.20 Three years after President Trump tweeted out a ban on transgender people in the military \u201cin any capacity,\u201d the White House says he\u2019s sticking with the policy. Each of the military service chiefs testified before Congress in 2018 they had seen no evidence of transgender service disrupting unit cohesion during the period of open service and a Dept. of Defense poll found about two-thirds of active-duty soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines support serving alongside transgender personnel.\n\n07.28.20 The Trump Administration plans to limit work permits for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from two years to one year. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in June that the administration could not carry out its plans to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program because it did not provide legal justification for terminating it. Of the 640,000 \u201cDreamers,\u201d 81,000 identify as LGBT and 39,000 have participated in DACA.\n\n07.27.20 After his administration supported the losing side at the Supreme Court on LGBTQ job protections, President Trump promises to choose from a new list of conservative jurists in his next court appointments. One potential candidate is Kyle Duncan, appointed by President Trump to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Duncan\u2019s anti-LGBT record includes arguing against trans student Gavin Grimm\u2019s request to use the restroom consistent with his gender identity and arguing against national marriage equality and calling the Supreme Court ruling in favor of it an \u201cabject failure\u201d that \u201cimperils civic peace.\u201d\n\n07.27.20 President Trump\u2019s niece, Mary Trump, says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d that her uncle believes he has support in the LGBTQ community, that he\u2019s uncomfortable with gay people and trans people, because \u201che\u2019s uncomfortable with anyone that\u2019s different\u2026 differently-abled, different color of skin, and different beliefs\u2026 He\u2019s not [an] ally of the gay community, or really any community for that matter. Donald doesn\u2019t have any concern or beliefs beyond his own self-interest.\u201d\n\n07.23.20 Trump administration revokes HUD regulation designed to eliminate racial disparities in the suburbs. Housing advocates say Trump\u2019s claims about the rule are inaccurate and racist. Only 30% of Black LGBT Americans own a home compared to 64.3% of the overall population.\n\n07.23.20 Former leader of now-defunct conversion therapy ministry, Exodus International, reveals previous lobbying work he did with members of the Trump administration. Randy Thomas has since denounced conversion therapy and announced his engagement to Dan Scobey. \u201cGiven my experience,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cI believe Mike Pence is still supportive of ex-gay ministry and he supports the efforts to try to convert people from gay to straight.\u201d Thomas also references working with Kellyanne Conway and other former Republican leaders, lobbying against marriage equality and hate crime legislation.\n\n07.22.20 Jenna Ellis, senior legal advisor to Donald Trump, retweets an article that promotes conversion therapy. Psychologists worldwide confirm LGBTQ people cannot change their gender identity or sexual orientation through conversion therapy. The American Psychiatric Association condemns such treatment and describes any attempts to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation as unethical. Ellis has a long record of racist and homophobic rhetoric, including criticizing her own Republican party for any attempt to embrace LGBTQ rights after the Pulse massacre killed 49 people, many of whom were LGBTQ.\n\n07.17.20 Defense Department confirms that new guidance to prohibit the display of Confederate flags on military institutions also includes bans on LGBTQ Pride flags. The Modern Military Association of America says the Pentagon is twisting the Confederate flag ban to achieve an anti-LGBTQ goal.\n\n07.17.20 New details emerge from proposed Housing and Urban Development rule limiting access for transgender people in single-sex homeless shelters. According to text from a leaked document obtained by Vox, the rule would allow federally-funded shelters to judge a person\u2019s physical characteristics, such as height and facial hair, in determining access to the shelter. Factors to be considered include \u201cthe presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam\u2019s apple, and other physical characteristics which, when considered together, are indicative of a person\u2019s biological sex.\u201d\n\n07.17.20 The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upholds lower court ruling blocking Trump administration from implementing new restrictions on people seeking asylum in the U.S. The proposal would eliminate gender-based asylum, despite dire consequences for women and girls seeking protection from extreme abuse and could result in judges rejecting similar claims based on gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\n07.16.20 U.S. Supreme Court allows policy banning voting rights to 1.4 million potential voters in Florida. Florida governor and Trump supporter Ron DeSantis and Republicans in the state legislature voted to require ex-felons pay court fines and fees before being allowed to vote, despite an amendment passed by Florida voters in 2018 restoring their right to vote. In May, a U.S. district judge ruled that the policy amounted to an unconstitutional voting tax. LGBTQ people are disproportionately incarcerated, especially young LGBTQ people and LGBTQ people of color, because they face housing, police and job discrimination.\n\n07.16.20 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo headlines a report from a pseudo-advisory group he appointed, criticizing efforts for racial justice and prioritizing religious freedom and property rights above all other human rights concerns. The so-called Commission on Unalienable Rights report refers to abortion, affirmative action, and same-sex marriage as \u201cdivisive social and political controversies in the United States\u201d rather than legally determined and settled rights. Pompeo delivered his speech before a large indoor crowd, despite urgent restrictions against such gatherings because of their documented increased risk of spreading the coronavirus.\n\n07.15.20 Former football coach Tommy Tuberville defeats Trump\u2019s former U.S. Attorney General and former Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions in the state\u2019s GOP primary runoff. Sessions\u2019 record on LGBTQ issues includes opposing all bills on LGBTQ equality throughout his decades in the U.S. Senate and continuing his assault on LGBTQ rights as Attorney General. Tuberville is a robust supporter of Trump, with a record of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric.\n\n07.13.20 Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany falsely claims President Trump has \u201ca great record\u201d with the LGBTQ community. Trump has an abysmal record of attacks on LGBTQ people, including implementing a ban on transgender people in the military, rolling back access to healthcare and homeless shelters, and defending discrimination in multiple cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n07.13.20 Trump ally and harsh opponent of LGBTQ rights Andrzej Duda wins second term as president of Poland. Duda governed and campaigned against LGBTQ rights, calling them an \u201cideology\u201d worse than Soviet-era communism. Duda\u2019s nationalist-conservative party rules the Polish Parliament with an aim to symbolically and literally erase queer Poles from social and political life, making Poland the least friendly country in the European Union to LGBTQ people. Trump and Duda have met 11 times, including at the White House in June, the first foreign leader to visit since the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States.\n\n07.10.20 Anti-LGBTQ+ groups tied to President Donald Trump received loans from the Small Business Administration as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. Several anti-LGBTQ organizations receiving money are designated hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center including Liberty Counsel, American Family Association, Pacific Justice Institute. Companies tied to Trump\u2019s adult children, son-in-law and millionaire friends also received money. At least $1.4 billion in taxpayer-backed funds went to the U.S. Roman Catholic Church, with millions going to dioceses that paid massive settlements or sought bankruptcy protection after covering up for pedophile priests.

The government is expected to file its response to the suit filed by the naval officer in federal court.\n\n05.05.20\u2014HHS ruling targets LGBTQ youth during public health crisis.

A few others claimed it was the first to fly over federal property on a permanent basis. We never made this claim. The media interest in this supposed precedent is what prompted our interest in whether either statement was factually accurate. NPS never pulled our support. The permit was never in question. We staffed the event, supplied power and the amplification equipment. The only issue was whether we would have someone offer welcoming remarks. We don\u2019t do that for every event we permit on our property and we unfortunately sent mixed signals here.\u201d\n\n06.12.19\u2014President Trump failed to recognize the third anniversary of the
