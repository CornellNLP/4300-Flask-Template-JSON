Kathy Hochul urging more action.\n\nThe growing number of migrants at the US-Mexico border has posed a steep challenge for the Biden administration. It\u2019s a delicate issue for a White House dogged by fierce criticism from the left and right over its handling of the US southern border and remains a political vulnerability amid Republican attacks as the 2024 presidential election approaches and Democratic local officials face pressures at home.\n\nHochul\u2019s announcement this week is the latest salvo in the ongoing migrant saga that has bedeviled local and state officials struggling to navigate the crisis that they have said needs a more robust federal response. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019ve managed thus far without substantive support from Washington,\u201d Hochul said in an address from Albany Thursday.\n\nIn a letter to the White House, Hochul urged Biden to take executive action to expedite work authorizations for asylum seekers, provide more financial aid to the city and the state and make more federal land available to house migrants, among other asks.\n\nIn what may have been her most direct call for assistance, Hochul said she and New York City Mayor Eric Adams have been sounding the alarm for expedited work authorization for migrants and additional federal funds to manage the crisis since July 2022.\n\n\u201cIn our first meeting with the President, Mayor Adams and I have championed the idea of a federal designation that would allow the individuals already here in New York, the ability to work to support themselves and their families,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cThe mayor and I said that and in countless meetings with Congress, the White House, Cabinet members and rallies with labor, press conferences and working with business. What we\u2019ve said all along is just let them work and help us out financially.\u201d\n\nNew York City has been the recipient of millions of dollars in federal funding to address the growing number of migrant arrivals. The administration also expects over $100 million of that support to be made available in the coming weeks.\n\nThe process for applying for asylum and a work permit is based on current immigration laws \u2013 and in recent years, has been made more difficult because of an immense backlog. Immigrant advocates argue that the Biden administration should expand the number of Venezuelans \u2013 who make up many of the migrant arrivals in New York \u2013 eligible for a form of humanitarian-relief known as Temporary Protected Status. That, they say, is perhaps the easiest form of action, without congressional action, the administration could take to satisfy the ask from New York. The Department of Homeland Security secretary has discretion to designate a country for TPS.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson said: \u201cWithout Congressional action, this Administration has been working to build a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system and has worked to identify ways to improve efficiencies and maximize the resources the federal government can provide to communities across the country to support the flow of migrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to partner with communities across the country to ensure they can receive the support they need. Only Congress can provide additional funding for these efforts, which this Administration has already requested, and only Congress can fix the broken immigration system,\u201d the spokesperson added.\n\nTom Perez, the director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, recently spent time in New York to try to smooth over tensions over the migrant crisis and coordinate with state and city partners, according to multiple sources. And DHS dispatched an assessment team to work with state and local officials, according to an administration official.\n\nTensions rise in New York\n\nThe situation has also caused a divide between Hochul and the Adams\u2019 administrations, with the mayor having previously asked for asylum seekers to be sent to other municipalities throughout the state, not just stay in New York City.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019re disappointed that the state today appears to minimize the role that they can \u2013 and must \u2013 play in responding to this crisis, the state must fulfil its duty to more than 8 million of the state\u2019s residents who call New York City home,\u201d Adams said in a press release Thursday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWhatever differences we all may have about how to handle this crisis; we believe what is crystal clear is that whatever obligations apply under state law to the City of New York apply with equal force to every county across New York state. Leaving New York City alone to manage this crisis \u2013 and abdicating the state\u2019s responsibility to coordinate a statewide response \u2013 is unfair to New York City residents who also didn\u2019t ask to be left almost entirely on their own in the middle of a national crisis.\u201d\n\nHochul, meanwhile, has been steadfast in saying she would not use her executive powers to force other counties to take in asylum seekers, citing the city\u2019s right-to-shelter law, which has been the backdrop of an ongoing legal back-and-forth between the city and the state.\n\n\u201cThis is an agreement that does not apply to the state\u2019s other 57 counties, which is one of the reasons we cannot and will not force other parts of our state to shelter migrants,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cNor are we going to be asking migrants to move to other parts of the state against their will.\u201d\n\nShe said that the state is working with the Department of Labor to connect migrants with jobs once the federal government approves their work authorizations. There have been 2600 families that have applied for asylum over the past 7 weeks, according to New York State Homeland Security Commissioner Jackie Bray. In a survey from this past May, 10% of people being sheltered have previously applied for asylum, Bray said.\n\nHochul said the plan, which hinges on asylum seekers being allowed to work, would help the migrant crisis, as well as businesses, which have struggled to find people to work.\n\n\u201cThis is a national and a federal issue, but New York has shouldered this burden for far too long,\u201d Hochul said.",
