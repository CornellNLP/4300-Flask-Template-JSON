They have suggested that the panel did not release certain transcripts because they contradict some of the testimony from a prominent witness, Cassidy Hutchinson, who served as an aide to Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff at the time. While much of her testimony has been corroborated, Ms. Hutchinson acknowledged that in some cases she was relying on secondhand or thirdhand accounts of events in her testimony to the panel.\n\n\u201cIt took a whole lot of work to get these,\u201d Representative Barry Loudermilk, a Republican of Georgia who is leading the G.O.P.\u2019s investigation, said of the transcript of the valet\u2019s testimony and a batch of others he obtained from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMr. Loudermilk conceded there was \u201csome testimony in it that may not be favorable to Trump,\u201d but he added: \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all out there, not doing what the select committee did, and putting things out there that will be favorable to our side.\u201d",
