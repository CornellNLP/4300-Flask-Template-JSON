Kennedy Jr. in recent days, marking the first significant attempt by either party to shape voter sentiment around his candidacy ahead of a potential rematch of the 2020 election.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has taken multiple steps in recent days to portray Kennedy as a spoiler who would help Republican frontrunner Donald Trump defeat President Joe Biden, arguing Kennedy is funded primarily by wealthy donors aligned with the former president.\n\nLast week, the DNC filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Kennedy\u2019s campaign had illegally coordinated with American Values 2024, a PAC backing his White House bid. Kennedy\u2019s campaign has denied coordinating with the group.\n\nIn a call with reporters outlining the complaint, DNC adviser Ramsey Reid blamed Trump and his donors for turning Kennedy into a \u201cstalking horse\u201d by funding the PAC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that Donald Trump is disrespecting the democratic process. It\u2019s pretty clear that Trump and his megadonors are propping up RFK Jr. as a stalking horse,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe DNC has homed in on donations to the PAC from billionaire Tim Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking fortune who has been a prolific donor to pro-Trump and other GOP causes over the years. Mellon gave approximately $15 million to American Values 2024 last year. In 2020, he gave $20 million to America First Action Inc., one of the leading outside groups backing Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nOn Saturday, as Kennedy held a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the DNC advertised on four billboards around the area accusing Kennedy of being \u201cpowered by MAGA/Trump.\u201d And after the Kennedy-aligned PAC released a new TV ad during the Super Bowl that repurposed an old spot from the 1960 campaign of President John F. Kennedy, the candidate\u2019s uncle, the DNC issued a statement highlighting the PAC\u2019s funding from Mellon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump\u2019s largest donor this cycle,\u201d DNC rapid response director Alex Floyd said in a statement released shortly after the ad aired Sunday.\n\nKennedy\u2019s team pushed back on the Democratic attacks, saying that donors \u201cfrom across the political spectrum are supporting the Kennedy campaign as they are tired of the corruption in the two-party system.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, donors want an independent candidate who will heal the divide, restore the middle class, end the forever wars, unravel corporate capture, and the end chronic disease epidemic,\u201d Kennedy campaign spokeswoman Stefanie Spear said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDNC adviser Lis Smith told CNN the party\u2019s latest efforts are meant to educate voters on the connections between Trump and Kennedy, while acknowledging the critical role Kennedy could play in the general election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Donald Trump and his allies view him as a useful stalking horse who could help throw the election to Trump in November,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile his independent campaign faces steep odds of success, Kennedy\u2019s candidacy could influence the outcome of a Biden-Trump rematch if he garners enough support in critical states. In the 2020 election, Biden flipped three states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin \u2013 by margins of less than 1%. Recent national polling of a Trump-Biden rematch suggests the race could be narrowly decided again. A CNN/SSRS poll released earlier this month showed Trump with 49% support among registered voters, compared with 45% for Biden.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear as of now how Kennedy would affect a potential general election between Biden and Trump \u2013 whether he\u2019d draw more support from historically Republican or Democratic voters, or whether he\u2019d receive enough total support to influence the election either way. An NBC News poll released this month found 34% of registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s allies have targeted Biden and Democrats as they look to gain traction in the race, a sign they\u2019re ready to meet the DNC\u2019s escalating attacks straight ahead. In a statement released after the Super Bowl ad, American Values 2024 co-founder Mark Gorton criticized the DNC for its efforts targeting Kennedy.\n\n\u201cThe only argument the DNC has left is that Biden is not Trump. When RFK Jr. gets on the ballot, the American public will have the ability to choose a candidate who is not Trump, who has integrity, bravery, a proven track record of fighting corporate corruption, and the ability to stand up to the corporate interests that have taken over the Biden administration. The American people are waking up, and the DNC\u2019s only hope is to prevent them from having a choice,\u201d Gorton said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and David Wright contributed to this report.",
