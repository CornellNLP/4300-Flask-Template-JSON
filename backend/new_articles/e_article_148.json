    "text": "As House Republicans struggled to maintain any remaining momentum they might have had in their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden during another committee hearing Wednesday, even hosts on Fox News and Newsmax seemed to be losing patience with it.\n\nPrior to the hearing, House Oversight Committee member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) appeared on Newmax\u2019s Wake Up America where host Rob Finnerty compared the committee's actions to a dog chasing its own tail.\n\nAfter noting that House Republicans have their slimmest majority yet of the current Congress, Finnerty told Jordan that unless some Democrats cross the aisle, an impeachment vote is going to be \u201creal tough.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt kind of seems like you\u2019re chasing your tail at this point, because this is not going to go anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFair question,\u201d Jordan replied. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got a small majority. Everybody understands that\u2014not just on this issue but on a host of issues. Our job, under the Constitution, is to do oversight of the executive branch. We\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re going to continue to do that.\u201d\n\nJordan didn\u2019t indicate that his committee\u2019s work would be wrapping up anytime soon, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no time limit in the Constitution on how long you can do an investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a timeline,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s no specific outcome we\u2019re trying to get to.\u201d\n\nFinnerty responded by stressing that the time frame is, in fact, key, \u201cbecause if Joe Biden gets re-elected on Nov. 5, it\u2019s all for naught.\u201d\n\nYet Jordan wouldn\u2019t commit to a vote. \u201cAgain, we\u2019ll have to see where the conference is.\u201d\n\nIn the next hour on Fox News, anchor Dana Perino was similarly skeptical.\n\n\u201cAt the end of this week, Congress is set to go into recess for another two weeks, and I do think that in some ways it just feels like they keep doing the same hearing over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd people are starting to wonder: At some point, do you fish or cut bait, and do something about a vote or not, and move on to the general election?\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing included testimony from Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani, who said Republicans\u2019 impeachment push is \u201cpredicated on a bunch of false information that is being spread by the Kremlin.\u201d\n\n\u201cEventually you\u2019ve brainwashed yourself [in]to believing certain things that are not true,\u201d Parnas said of his work with the longtime Trump ally ahead of the 2020 election. \u201cI started thinking [to] myself that this can\u2019t be true. And we were doing something wrong.\u201d\n\nLast month, one of the GOP\u2019s key impeachment witnesses\u2014who said he has ties to Russian intelligence assets\u2014was arrested by the FBI for allegedly lying to the bureau about Biden and his son, Hunter. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) then tried to claim\u2014despite his past comments\u2014that Alexander Smirnov actually \u201cwasn\u2019t an important part\u201d of his investigation.\n\nDuring a break in Wednesday\u2019s hearing, committee member Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) was pressed about next steps on both Newsmax and Fox. On the former, reporter Kilmeny Duchardt asked him what the committee needs in order to \u201cfill in these holes,\u201d considering how \u201ca lot of this evidence is situational [and] circumstantial.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, Fox anchor John Roberts told Donalds that \u201cthe needle hasn\u2019t appreciably moved on this case\u201d in some time, and followed up by asking how long the investigation can continue without \u201cevidence of wrongdoing on the president\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nAlso on Fox, the network\u2019s legal editor, Kerri Urbahn, seemed to sum up the day: \u201cI do think that people are maybe becoming a little bit tired of all of this.\u201d",
