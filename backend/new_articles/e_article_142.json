    "text": "President Biden has won the Arizona Democratic presidential primary, according to a projection from Decision Desk HQ.\n\nBiden has already become the presumptive Democratic nominee with his near sweep of the contests held last week. His win in the Grand Canyon State will give him most if not of the state\u2019s 72 pledged delegates available.\n\nThe remaining 13 unpledged delegates will be allocated at the Democratic National Convention this summer.\n\nBiden won the state\u2019s primary in his 2020 run over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and others, though with less than a majority of the vote.\n\nArizona will be hotly contested this November as a swing state. Biden was able to flip it blue in 2020 after the state had voted Republican in five presidential races in a row.",
