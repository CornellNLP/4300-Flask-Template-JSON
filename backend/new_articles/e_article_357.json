But the Biden-Harris campaign plans to highlight key moments from four years ago in an effort to flip the question back onto Trump, seeing a golden opportunity to exploit his handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a statement Friday morning highlighting Trump\u2019s pledge four years ago to the day to \u201cterminate\u201d the Affordable Care Act, roughly 10 days after the World Health Organization formally declared Covid-19 a global pandemic.\n\n\u201cFour years ago today, Trump was trying to throw millions of Americans off their insurance while Americans were dying by the thousands of Covid-19, even more Americans were infected, and hospitals were reaching a breaking point,\u201d Biden-Harris senior spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, the campaign released a digital ad that paired images from the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic with audio of Trump suggesting disinfectant as a treatment, downplaying concerns over the number of Covid-related deaths at the time and dismissing questions from reporters about his handling of the pandemic.\n\nAnd Biden is test-driving the strategy on the stump while speaking at fundraisers in Texas.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, he asked the famous question, are you better off today than you were yesterday? Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question,\u201d Biden said during a campaign reception in Houston on Thursday. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBiden pointed to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic and a debunked claim that Trump suggested the injection of bleach as a treatment option.\n\n\u201cHe must\u2019ve done it,\u201d Biden joked.\n\nIt comes amid a broader effort by Biden and his campaign to co-opt language made popular by Trump and Republicans.\n\nIn a bid to highlight that Biden held more campaign events this month than Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign accused the former president of \u201chiding in his basement\u201d \u2014 a line Trump and allies frequently deployed about Biden in 2020.\n\nThe campaign has also turned \u201cBrandon\u201d \u2014 a code word used by Republicans to insult Biden \u2014 into a kind of internet alter-ego and a core component of his social media branding, launching a \u201cDark Brandon\u201d account on X and releasing several \u201cDark Brandon\u201d-branded memes.\n\nA senior Biden-Harris campaign official told NBC News the campaign will continue to highlight \u201ckey moments from four years ago throughout the month of April.\u201d\n\nThose moments will include headlines reminding voters of rising crime and toilet paper shortages toward the end of Trump\u2019s first term and footage reminding voters of the \u201cchaos\u201d of the pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAmericans remember March Madness, proms, weddings, and celebrations being canceled, waiting in line for toilet paper and essentials, businesses shutting down, and losing loved ones \u2014 all because Trump failed to prepare for and then couldn\u2019t lead when we needed him the most,\u201d \u201cThe only thing to happen four years ago to make Americans\u2019 lives better was Donald Trump losing to Joe Biden,\u201d Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.",
