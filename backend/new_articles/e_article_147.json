The EPA pumped the brakes on that plan Wednesday.\n\nInstead of pushing automakers to sell more EVs to meet stringent pollution targets, the administration is allowing plug-in hybrids \u2014 vehicles that combine gas engines and EV-like batteries \u2014 to play a much bigger role in the electric transition.\n\nIn 2023, EVs made up just 7.6% of new car sales, according to Kelley Blue Book. The new rule is targeting 35% to 56% for EVs in 2032, and 13% to 36% for plug-in hybrids.\n\nTransportation has an outsized climate impact, making up nearly a third of all US climate pollution, so even small steps can lead to significant change. Margo Oge, who previously headed the agency\u2019s office of Transportation and Air Quality, called the new standard \u201cthe single most important climate regulation in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, President Joe Biden vowed the cars would be made by American workers. \u201cUS workers will lead the world on autos making clean cars and trucks, each stamped \u2018Made in America,\u2019\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d\n\nFederal officials said the rule doesn\u2019t favor electric vehicles over other types of vehicles, and will reduce nearly as much pollution as the original proposal \u2014 more than 7 billion metric tons of planet-warming emissions, along with other pollution that is detrimental to human health. By 2032, the new rule is expected to slash passenger car pollution nearly in half from 2026 levels.\n\n\u201cWithin those ranges, we got to the same place\u201d as the standard proposed last year, said Joe Goffman, who leads the agency\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation.\n\nGoffman said the agency considered different ways automakers could \u201cmix and match\u201d new vehicle models to meet the standard \u2014 by using more efficient gasoline engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cBy taking seriously the concerns of workers and communities, the EPA has created a more feasible emissions rule that protects workers building (traditional, gas-powered) vehicles, while providing a path forward for automakers to implement the full range of automotive technologies to reduce emissions,\u201d the United Auto Workers union said in a statement.\n\nWhite House national climate adviser Ali Zaidi said that \u201cone of the really strong features\u201d of the new rule was its flexibility.\n\n\u201cDifferent automakers are going to approach this in different ways,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have some automakers that maybe have a third of their fleet be plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.\u201d Zaidi argued that would \u201ctranslate into a lot of consumer choice.\u201d\n\nCarmakers get flexibility\n\nAutomakers like Toyota, who are favoring hybrids and plug-in hybrids and moving slowly on EVs, could be big benefactors of EPA\u2019s new rule.\n\nToyota, the world\u2019s largest automaker, is among the companies that aggressively pushed back against the Biden administration\u2019s original proposal.\n\nIn a memo sent in the fall of 2023 to car dealers across the US, Toyota Motor North America group vice president of government affairs Stephen Ciccone described the EPA\u2019s original EV proposal as a \u201cmandate\u201d and \u201cdraconian,\u201d CNN recently reported. Ciccone wrote the proposal had caused an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d in the industry and suggested an option giving automakers more choice.\n\n\u201cToyota\u2019s position is that the best way to reduce carbon is by giving consumers a choice of powertrain options, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, fuel efficient ICE vehicles, and BEVs,\u201d Ciccone wrote.\n\nThat flexibility is what the EPA finalized on Wednesday. But Toyota continued to characterize EPA\u2019s rule as a \u201cregulatory mandate\u201d that will force it further into the EV game than it\u2019s currently positioned.\n\nThe rule \u201crequires a precipitous shift from around 8% market share of battery electric vehicles today to more than half by 2032 \u2013 an aggressive, sixfold increase over just eight years,\u201d said Toyota spokesperson Edward Lewis in a statement. \u201cToyota will continue to lead the industry and comply with regulations, but serious challenges around affordability, charging infrastructure, and supply chain will need to be addressed before this mandate is realized.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made the transition to EVs a signature issue of his presidency, stressing the economic impacts, in addition to the climate benefits, of cutting pollution. In August 2021, after the president announced an ambitious target that half of vehicles sold in the country by 2030 would be either battery electric, fuel-cell electric or plug-in hybrid, Biden test-drove a hybrid-electric Jeep on the White House grounds.\n\nBut political battle lines are being drawn around the EV transition. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election, has railed against EVs in his speeches. He recently characterized EVs as \u201call\u201d being made in China, even though Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act has pushed a new EV manufacturing and assembly to the United States.\n\nWith the new standard giving automakers more flexibility, EPA administrator Michael Regan denounced the characterization that the agency was setting an EV \u201cmandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the differences between the proposal and final, you will see that there is absolutely no mandate,\u201d Regan told reporters, adding his agency was staying \u201cwell within the confines of the law.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump; the jump to EVs has some of Biden\u2019s political allies worried, too. The United Auto Workers, a powerful union that has endorsed Biden, has also expressed concerns about what the shift to EVs could mean for their workers, who believe battery-powered cars require less labor to build.\n\nBut the demand for fully electric cars is growing in the US. The nation crossed a key threshold at the end of last year: 1.2 million electric vehicles were sold \u2014 a 46.3% jump from 2022.\n\nEV adoption rates are likely to slow down this year, which is to be expected, said Trevor Houser, partner at the nonpartisan Rhodium Group. He\u2019s looking for two main signs of EV success in the coming years: whether automakers can make a wide enough variety of the vehicles Americans want to drive, and whether the cost can come down to a more affordable range of $20,000 to $30,000.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t really know before (2025) how successfully we\u2019re making that transition because the next generation of more affordable EVs won\u2019t be on the market,\u201d Houser told CNN.\n\nZaidi agreed it would take time to see whether more Americans move to fully electric cars.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ll see over time,\u201d Zaidi said. \u201cBut this rule is very flexible and allows for all of those pathways to emerge, and for (automakers) to pursue those in a manner that\u2019s consistent with their strategies.\u201d\n\nClimate and health impacts\n\nWhile the climate impact of the tailpipe rules have drawn the most attention, there is a big public-health component, as well.\n\nReducing pollution from cars and trucks could help Americans\u2019 health on multiple levels, since the EPA\u2019s multi-pollutant standards will tackle greenhouse gases that cause climate change, smog and particle emissions.\n\nNo amount of air pollution is safe, and according to the World Health Organization, it\u2019s one of the greatest environmental risks to human health.\n\nVehicle exhaust is made up of all sorts of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and carbon emissions that contribute to a warming world, which is also itself a major threat to health.\n\nExposure to particle pollution ages and reduces lung function, and it can lead to cancer, stroke, heart problems, COPD and other lung and vascular issues. It can aggravate asthma and is linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and other types of dementia, studies have found. People exposed to higher amounts of this pollution for longer periods also have an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Exposure can even contribute to problems thinking clearly.\n\nParticle pollution led to more than 107,000 premature deaths in the US in just one year, one 2019 study found. That\u2019s more than the number of people killed each year in homicides and traffic accidents combined, researchers said.\n\n\u201cThese standards really provide significant relief that communities across America need from vehicle exhaust,\u201d said Will Barrett, the American Lung Association\u2019s senior director of advocacy for clean air. \u201cIt\u2019s very much setting a strong direction to ensuring the auto industry cleans up harmful pollutants and communities are better protected from traffic emissions.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN\u2019s Angela Dewan contributed to this report.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated what kind of vehicle Biden tested on White House grounds. It was a hybrid-electric Jeep.",
