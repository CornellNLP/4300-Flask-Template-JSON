    "text": "President Biden is using the anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to improve former President Trump\u2019s record on health care and capitalize on his threats to repeal the law.\n\nIn a new digital ad published on Friday before 14th anniversary of the law, the Biden campaign sought to highlight Trump\u2019s repeated threats to repeal it and highlight the consequences if he wins a second term.\n\nThe video, titled \u201cFlatline,\u201d features audio of Trump\u2019s criticism of ObamaCare as on-screen text describing what repealing the law would do.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump tried to rob our health care,\u201d the ad said. \u201cHe failed. But he comes back for it.\n\nThe messages play over an image of a heart monitor that eventually flattens out.\n\nAs president, Trump came just one vote away from repealing the law and has said he wants to try again.\n\n\u201cIf he succeeds \u2026 45 million Americans could lose their health insurance,\u201d the ad said. \u201cAnd you might be one of them.\u201d\n\nThe campaign said the ad will run on digital platforms including Meta, YouTube and affiliate TV in English and Spanish in battleground states.\n\nIn addition to the ad, the campaign is holding a digital rally this weekend with former President Obama and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). The national appeal aims to \u201cmobilize supporters and volunteers around defending the ACA from Trump\u2019s attacks,\u201d the campaign said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is also running digital battleground ads criticizing Trump for his efforts to repeal the ACA.\n\nAds will appear as digital front pages on local newspaper websites in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nThe Biden campaign and Democratic allies enthusiastically jumped into battle with Trump over ObamaCare after the presumptive GOP nominee emerged seeking to repeal the law.\n\nMore than 40 million people have health insurance through ObamaCare, and the law is more popular than ever. Biden campaign officials see keeping it as a major political issue as enrollments for coverage in 2024 hit a record 21.3 million.\n\nBiden and Democrats have long seen health care as a winning issue for them, and the president has targeted the pocketbook issue to cut people\u2019s costs amid broad concerns about the economy.\n\n\u201cWe cannot take this progress for granted. Extreme MAGA Republicans have voted over 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Just this week, Trump\u2019s allies in the House of Representatives proposed a budget that would gut this life-saving legislation,\u201d Biden said in a statement Friday, referring to the budget proposal from the Republican Study Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is not hyperbole to say that affordable health care for millions of people is on the line in November. I am more determined than ever to fight back against the Republican attacks on MAGA and make health care a right, not a privilege, in America,\u201d Biden said.\n\nCoverage of the 2024 election\n\nThe Biden campaign is also trying to use Trump\u2019s \u201care you better\u201d argument against him.\n\nOn Friday, Biden\u2019s team played a clip from a news conference exactly four years ago in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Trump said he wanted to \u201cend\u201d ObamaCare and reiterated his support for a lawsuit to end the law.\n\n\u201cTaking health care away from millions of Americans is always a bad idea, but Trump\u2019s efforts in March 2020 \u2014 when thousands of Americans were dying \u2014 couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cDonald Trump and his campaign keep asking the country if we are better off now than we were four years ago. Time and time again, the answer is yes.\u201d",
