    "text": "Sharing is Caring!\n\nLawyers representing Trump keep getting sanctioned by courts.\n\nAt least 17 of them have been slapped by judges, mostly for litigation challenging elections.\n\nAlina Habba, Rudy Giuliani, and Sidney Powell are all among those who have been sanctioned.\n\nWhen lawyers try to help Donald Trump with his problems, they often end up with problems of their own.\n\nSeventeen different lawyers have been sanctioned over failed lawsuits brought on the former president\u2019s behalf. Their attempts include litigation seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and pushing a conspiracy theory blaming the Russia investigation on a smattering of Democratic party operatives.\n\nThe risks of working as a lawyer for Trump, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen previously told Insider, comes from the mogul\u2019s refusal to take a loss.\n\n\u201cFor Donald, the only option is victory at any cost,\u201d Cohen, who was disbarred following a criminal conviction based on actions he took on Trump\u2019s behalf, told Insider. \u201cThis even includes having counsel act in ways detrimental to their reputation and career.\u201d\n\nuk.movies.yahoo.com/movies/trumps-lawyers-keep-getting-slammed-140000084.html",
