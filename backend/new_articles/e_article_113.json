Why, then, did Hunter yell at CEFC Executive Director Zang in front of his entourage as I sat right next to him in New York City on Sunday May 7th, 2017? Hunter was adamant that he was owed the rest of the $20 Million CEFC had committed to paying for the work he had claimed he had done in prior years.\"In the second instance, Bobulinski argued that Hunter Biden lied when he claimed that Joe Biden never interacted with Hunter\u2019s associates:\"On Page 48 of his transcript, Hunter is asked, 'He\u2019s never interacted with any of your business associates. Is that correct?' The 'He\u2019s' is a reference to Joe Biden. Hunter responds, 'Yes'. Hunter arranged the meeting between his father and me at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles on May 2, 2017. The sole reason Hunter wanted me to meet his father was because I was the CEO of Sinohawk, the Bidens\u2019 partnership with CEFC. I was a business associate. In his transcript, Hunter confirms that that meeting with Joe took place and incriminates his Uncle Jim for perjury by confirming it.\"In the third example, Bobulinski said Hunter \u201clied\u201d about leveraging Joe Biden to receive a $5 million payment from CEFC:\"Hunter lied to the Committee about important details concerning his money demands and threats to CEFC on July 30 and July 31, 2017. He leveraged his father\u2019s presence next to him in that infamous text in order to strong-arm CEFC into paying Hunter immediately and in the process defrauded the partners of Sinohawk Holdings LLC and Oneida Holdings LLC. The threat worked, as a few days later the Chinese wired $5 million dollars into a company of which Hunter owned 50%. It\u2019s important to remember that CEFC considered this money an interest-free loan to the 'Biden family,' and planned to send more. I have the email from CEFC to prove it.\"Bobulinski also said Joe Biden was \u201cmore than a participant in and beneficiary of his family\u2019s business\u201d but \u201cwas an active, aware enabler who met with business associates such as myself to further the business, despite being buffered by a complex scheme to maintain plausible deniability.\u201d\u201cIf there is no evidence of corruption \u2013 if Joe\u2019s conduct and the conduct of his family were fully legal and proper \u2013 then why are they so dishonest about it?\u201d Bobulinski asked. \u201cNot just slight misrepresentations of fact but deep untruths about the entire corrupt enterprise.\u201dSouth Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace fired off an intense round of \"yes or no\" questions aimed at Joe Biden's involvement in his son's business dealings.Mace directed her questions to Bobulinski and another ex-Hunter Biden business associate, Jason Galanis, asking them to verify various interactions with Biden, Hunter and the business associates concerning various deals and transactions.Those interactions included Joe Biden taking calls from Hunter where he updated his dad on certain business deals, confirming a reserved board seat for Joe Biden at a company, that Joe Biden lied when he denied meeting with Hunter's business partners, and that the family received money from Chinese business interests.Bobulinski and Galanis answered \"yes\" to each of Mace's questions.\"Joe Biden has repeatedly claimed that he was not involved in Hunter Biden's, Jim Biden's, or any other Biden family business deals. Today our witnesses have proved otherwise,\" Mace said at the conclusion of her questioning.Bobulinski also directly confronted two Democrat members of the Oversight Committee, accusing them of lying in the media about the impeachment inquiry. \"Representatives Dan Goldman and Jamie Raskin, both lawyers, and Mr. Goldman a former prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, will continue to lie today in this hearing and then go straight to the media to tell more lies,\" he said in his opening statement.\n\nYour Choice\n\nFree Press International\n\n[\n\nPublish This Content\n\n]",
