    "text": "President Biden\u2018s reelection campaign had over double the amount at the end of February than that of former President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission filings, Mr. Biden had $71 million on hand, while Mr. Trump held $33.5 million.\n\nThe Democratic incumbent\u2019s campaign has proved to be much better at securing funds. While Mr. Trump\u2018s campaign added $3.5 million in February, Mr. Biden\u2018s team added a whopping $15 million.\n\nBoth campaigns get more funds from joint fundraising committees, adding to their total.\n\nReports from the joint fundraising committees are set to come out mid-April, offering more insight into how the campaigns are faring.\n\nMore cash means more opportunities to advertise, especially in battleground states.\n\nVarious reports suggest that Mr. Trump\u2018s court issues have caused the campaign to be drained of funds, with committees covering some of his legal fees.\n\nThe lack of funds may turn around after a fundraiser next month in Palm Beach, Florida, to benefit the former president. It\u2019s expected to draw some of the Republican Party\u2019s wealthiest donors.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump continues to lead Mr. Biden in most polls, including in crucial Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\n\u2022 Mallory Wilson can be reached at mwilson@washingtontimes.com.",
