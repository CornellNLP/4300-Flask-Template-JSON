Nikki Haley. Lastly, 3.9% of votes went towards Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)\n\nRon DeSantis endorsed Trump after he dropped out of the race and Florida is his home state, so it\u2019s not surprising that Trump won. Trump\u2019s win is not only in Florida, he also won the Republican primary in Illinois. According to The Hill, there are 64 GOP delegates up for grabs in Illinois.\n\nAs it stands, the former President has already met the delegate requirements needed to secure the Republican nomination for 2024.\n\nThis is coming after Trump received backlash for saying that there would be a \u201cbloodbath\u201d for the country if he doesn\u2019t get elected. He made the statement during a campaign rally in Ohio on Saturday for Senate candidate Bernie Moreno.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Florida!! I know more wasn\u2019t expected,\u201d someone commented. \u201cI really do not like this man but at this point I honestly rather Trump in office before Biden Ain\u2019t never hear Trump attempt to give billions of dollars to man other country to side in a war that we don\u2019t got shit to do with,\u201d another person wrote.",
