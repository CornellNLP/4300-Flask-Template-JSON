With his track record of supporting working people, we're eager for his administration's continued progress on our core issues. #USW #Steelworkers #1u #Biden2024 pic.twitter.com/WwJyT68DAz \u2014 United Steelworkers #EverybodysUnion (@steelworkers) March 20, 2024\n\nAmong the factors behind the latest endorsement was Biden\u2019s opposition to the planned sale of U.S. Steel, the nation\u2019s second largest steel manufacturer, to a Japanese company, Nippon Steel. \u201cIt is vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated,\u201d the president said in a statement last week. The union had previously endorsed Biden in 2020.\n\nBiden has already received endorsements from several other major U.S. labor unions, including AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, and the American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden bet on the American worker, while Donald Trump blamed the American worker,\u201d UAW President Shawn Fain said during his speech in January announcing the union\u2019s endorsement of Biden. After losing the UAW endorsement, Donald Trump aired his grievances against Fain on Truth Social.
