If you can\u2019t beat\u2019em join\u2019em. pic.twitter.com/lso7luf6In \u2014 @amuse (@amuse) March 19, 2024\n\nInstead of acknowledging Trump\u2019s record-breaking economy, Biden chose to spread fear and division, claiming that the American Dream of home ownership is now out of reach for too many people.\n\nBIDEN: \u201cThat black home was worth 20% less than the white home!\u201d pic.twitter.com/VSSx5RyqHK \u2014 RNC Research (@RNCResearch) March 19, 2024\n\nBut the truth is that housing costs have risen because of Biden\u2019s failed economic policies. His administration\u2019s inaction on high-interest rates and the rising cost of living have made it difficult for working-class families to own a home. And yet, he has the audacity to blame President Trump for these issues.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to win over voters, Biden promised a $10,000 mortgage relief tax credit and a $10,000 tax credit for those selling their homes. But how does he plan to fund these handouts?\n\nOf course, Biden will increase taxes on hardworking Americans. It\u2019s obvious his solution to every problem is to throw more money at it rather than implement sound economic policies that have proven successful under President Trump.\n\nBiden also called on real estate brokerages to \u201clower commissions,\u201d conveniently ignoring that the National Association of Realtors agreed to resolve an antitrust lawsuit just last week.\n\nIn Arizona, Biden spoke at a Mexican restaurant in a blatant attempt to appeal to Latino voters. He knows that he needs their support if he wants to win battleground states, but his charm offensive can\u2019t hide the fact that he flip-flopped on key issues, such as immigration and trade, to pander to his base.\n\nBiden is panicking as Trump\u2019s approval ratings continue to rise. It seems many on both sides of the fence are not happy with Biden. Some left-wing voters have even launched an \u201cAbandon Biden\u201d movement, urging voters to support an obscure author in the Democratic primary.",
