    "text": "Melania Trump, who has been conspicuously absent from her husband\u2019s campaign events, is staying tight-lipped about her role in Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 election bid.\n\nAccompanying the former president to the polls in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Melania Trump was asked by a reporter if she would be joining Donald Trump on the campaign.\n\n\u201cStay tuned,\u201d she responded.\n\nDonald Trump has teased his wife\u2019s involvement in his campaign for months, saying she\u2019ll \u201cplay a big role\u201d and that she will be out on the campaign trail \u201ca lot more.\u201d But the former first lady, who\u2019s known for being intensely private, has yet to appear at an event.\n\nMelania Trump has made very few public appearances since leaving the White House in 2021, choosing instead to keep a low profile. More recently, in November, she joined other former first ladies at Rosalynn Carter\u2019s tribute service. Weeks later she made a surprise appearance at a naturalization ceremony at the National Archives, where she also delivered a speech.\n\nAs first lady, Melania Trump often appeared unhappy with the scrutiny that came with the role. Her youth anti-cyberbullying initiative, \u201cBe Best,\u201d was poorly received, as were her controversial renovations of the White House. In 2018 she was also roundly criticized for wearing a jacket that said \u201cI Really Don\u2019t Care. Do U?\u201d while visiting a detention center for migrant children \u2014 a message she later claimed was meant for the media.\n\nDespite her apparent discomfort in the high-profile role, Melania Trump has said that she supports her husband\u2019s 2024 re-election bid, telling Fox News last year that they \u201clook forward to restoring hope for the future and leading America with love and strength.\u201d\n\nHer remarks stand in stark contrast to the tone of the campaign that her husband has embraced. As the 2024 election ramps up in earnest, Donald Trump has stepped up his violent anti-immigrant rhetoric, vowed to lock up his political enemies, and warned that U.S. democracy will end if he loses the election again.",
