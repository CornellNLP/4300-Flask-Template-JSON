    "text": "Private Residence\n\nHouston, Texas\n\n1:40 P.M. CDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Whoa. Holy mackerel. (Applause.) I\u2019m \u2014 folks, I never thought I\u2019d be down in this garage with a better scene than all those vehicles, but you are. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd please sit down, if you have a seat.\n\nWell, John Eddie and Sheridan, thank you for hosting me again and again and again and again. Your friendship is real, and it means a lot to me. It means a lot to Jill.\n\nAnd thanks to all of you for your support, including all of the lawyers here today who care deeply about the rule of law, and \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and you\u2019re are on the frontlines of fairness, justice, and defending democracy.\n\nYou know, if I \u2014 the first time I met down here, if I talked about, \u201cwe have to defend democracy,\u201d you all looked at me like I was \u2014 had too much to drink upstairs. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd, folks, we\u2019re seeing incredible enthusiasm all over the country. I\u2019ve traveled since we\u2019ve gotten the \u2014 since we announced formally in \u2014 to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Nevada, Arizona. And Jill and Kamala and Doug are traveling as well.\n\nOur grassroots support keeps getting stronger. So far, we have 1,300,000 people who have contributed to our campaign \u2014 1,300,000 \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and 500,000 of them brand-new \u2014 and 97 percent are people who contributed under $200. It\u2019s a real grassroots thing. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re ramping up our campaign headquarters and field offices, opening nearly 100 offices in the last several weeks \u2014 or actually mo- \u2014 a little \u2014 about a month and a half \u2014 and hiring staff all across the country before Trump and his MAGA Republicans have even \u2014 even opened one headquarters.\n\nAnd while we probably haven\u2019t read a lot about it, in the last few days, there has been five national polls. The press \u2014 well, I like the press \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 but they don\u2019t talk about it very much. Five national polls having us leading since my State of the Union Address. (Applause.)\n\nFolks \u2014 folks, but I know not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm. The other day, a defeated man \u2014 looking man came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, I\u2019m being crushed by debt. I\u2019m completely wiped out.\u201d And I had to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Donald, but I can\u2019t help you.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019d like to. Not much I can do. (Laughter.)\n\nSpeaking of Donald Trump, just a few days ago, he asked the famous question: Are you better off today than you were yesterday? Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question. (Laughter.)\n\nI hope everyone in the country takes a moment to think back where they were in March of 2020.\n\nCOVID had come to America, and Trump was president, and hospitals and emergency rooms were overwhelmed. First responders were risking their lives. Nurses were literally wearing garbage bags for protection in hospitals, and ventilators were in short supply. Mobile morgues were set up. Loved ones were dying all alone, and we couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to them.\n\nAnd unemployment shot up to 14 percent. The stock market crashed, and your grocery store shelves were empty. And the toilet paper panic \u2014 remember that one? (Laughter.)\n\nWell, Trump tried to downplay the virus. He told us, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll go away. Just stay calm. We\u2019ll be out of this by Easter.\u201d All while doing simply nothing.\n\nOf course, we know from Bob Woodward\u2019s book that Trump was lying to the American people and he knew it all along. He knew how dangerous the virus was, but he hid it from us.\n\nHe just kept \u2014 it kept getting worse. He told Americans \u2014 remember when he said inject bleach? (Laughter.) I think he must have done it. (Laughter.) He told us to hit the body with UV light, which I\u2019m confident he does. (Laughter.)\n\nBut, look, by the summer, Americans peacefully protested for justice in front of the White House, and what did he want? He wanted to tear gas them and \u2014 for a photo op.\n\nAnd after losing the 2020 election, char- \u2014 he finished his presidency by literally sending a mob to attack the Capitol.\n\nFour years later, we\u2019ve come a \u2014 pretty far. Donald Trump is not president, that\u2019s a starter. I am, because of you. (Applause.)\n\nI look out, I see so many of you who got me through in 2020. You \u2014 many of you have been with me a long time.\n\nCOVID is \u2014 no longer controls our lives. We\u2019ve created 15 million brand-new jobs, more jobs than any president has in (inaudible). (Applause.)\n\nWe have the lowest unemployment rate \u2014 lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. (Applause.)\n\nWe have a record economic growth, record small-business creation. Stock market is highest it\u2019s ever been. I know that doesn\u2019t matter to you all, but it\u2019s real. (Laughter.)\n\nInsulin for seniors now costs 35 bucks instead of 400 a month. Out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs for seniors are going to be capped at the end of this month [year] at $2,000 a year no matter what the cost is, including those cancer drugs that are $10-, $12-, $15,000.\n\n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t just save \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and, by the way, that just doesn\u2019t seniors money; it saves significant amounts of money for the \u2014 and reduces the deficit.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve done so far by dealing with Medicare being able to negotiate, which I\u2019ve been trying to do when I was a senator for years \u2014 we finally got it done, without much help from the other team \u2014 actually, without any help from the other team. (Laughter.) We\u2019re \u2014 but guess what? It cut the federal deficit by $160 billion \u2014 $160 billon. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads, bridges; delivering clean water, high-speed Internet to every American.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is booming. I never knew where it was written \u2014 it says we can\u2019t still lead the world in manufacturing. Eight hundred thousand new jobs since we \u2014 you got me elected the first time and still counting. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019ve attracted $650 billion in private-sector investment for clean energy, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors \u2014 all across America.\n\nWe made the biggest investment in history to combat climate. And we do more, of course \u2014 we have to do more.\n\nInflation peaked at 9 percent, but now it\u2019s down \u2014 dropped to 3 percent, the lowest in the world, and it\u2019s still going down. And with the grace of God, the goodwill of the neighbors, and the crick not rising, as my grandfather would say, it\u2019s going to continue to go down.\n\nBut we can more to do.\n\nLet me ask you: Does anyone want to go back to 2020?\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well \u2014 when \u2014 when fear ruled our lives when Trump was President? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nBut, look \u2014 look, folks, the problem isn\u2019t looking back to where the country \u2014 where Trump had the country. The problem is where he wants to take it now. Look at what he\u2019s saying, and he means what he\u2019s saying.\n\nI don\u2019t \u2014 you know, I made a speech when I \u2014 you got me nominated and I was first elected be- \u2014 while I was running in 2020 \u2014 at \u2014 at Independence Hall, saying our democracy was at risk. And a lot of the press thought it was a bit of hyperbole, but I don\u2019t think anybody thinks that anymore.\n\nHe wants to get rid of \u2014 this guy wants to do a whole lot that is contrary to what we\u2019ve been done \u2014 what\u2019s been done. He says he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Forty million Americans depend on that ACA.\n\nHe wants to get rid of savings I just got put into law to lower prescription drug prices, to 35 bucks for insulin for seniors.\n\nHe wants to enact another $2 thousand [$2 trillion] tax cut \u2014 they\u2019re not bad, if you can pay for it \u2014 the very wealthy and the biggest corporations. It\u2019s increased the debt larger than any president has in a four-year period.\n\nAnd, folks, if anyone doubts Trump and the Republicans would cut Social Security and Medicare, just look at what they said and done in the past week.\n\n\n\nTrump recently said about Social Security and Medicare, which is a lifeline for millions and millions of Americans \u2014 he said, \u201cThere\u2019s\u201d \u2014 quote, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do in terms of cutting.\u201d\n\nAnd just yesterday, 180 House Republicans in the House of Representatives took orders from him again, and they proposed to cut Social Security and Medicare and ch- \u2014 and up the age.\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve got a better idea. I\u2019ll protect Social Security and Medicare.\n\nLook, folks, he also \u2014 he\u2019s also a climate denier. He wants to do away with historic actions on climate we\u2019ve had.\n\nAfter another school shooting about a month ago, what did he say? Remember the famous quote? He said, \u201cWe just got to get over it.\u201d \u201cJust got to get over it.\u201d\n\nWell, I just want to stop it.\n\nIt\u2019s the same guy who, when he was talking about what happened in Normandy, he said \u2014 and they wanted to go to the gravesites, he said no. He said they\u2019re a bunch of \u201closers\u201d \u2014 a bunch of \u201closers.\u201d My son was one of those \u201closers.\u201d I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t standing with him. Not at Normandy, but in \u2014\n\nLook at the judges he put on the bench. Imagine who else he\u2019ll put on the bench if he gets reelected.\n\nOur reputation internationally was being crushed when he was president. Imagine what happens if he gets reelected. He wants to walk away from NATO. He tells Putin: Do, quote, \u201cwhatever the hell you want.\u201d\n\nHe hosts Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n of Hungary at Mar-a-Lago, and says he doesn\u2019t think democracies work \u2014 at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump brags about how he\u2019s the reason Roe v. Wade was overturned and the freedom to choose was taken away. America needs to know Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists are now calling for a national ban in every state in the Union \u2014 every state in the Union.\n\nOne more thing. Trump didn\u2019t just bring chaos into our \u2013lives of women. He\u2019s also bringing chaos in Am- \u2014 at the Amer- \u2014 at the American border. You know this, in Texas, better than anybody.\n\nYou know, with a group of bipartisan senators, led by a very conservative senator from Oklahoma, we negotiated for weeks and agreed on the strongest national security, border security law in American history: 1,500 more border security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to help tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve all these cases in six months instead of six years, because it takes six to eight years now to resolve these cases \u2014 it\u2019s chaos; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines that significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.\n\nBut Trump was worried \u2014 and this is the truth. Trump was worried \u2014 and it got bipartisan support. It looked like it was going to go through the Senate. And Trump got on the phone and started calling and \u2014 the senators. And he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be for it. You can\u2019t be for it,\u201d even though they liked it and it was strong, and he liked it. Because he couldn\u2019t stand the thought that we\u2019d get credit for something.\n\n\n\nFolks, this wasn\u2019t about whether it was good for me or Trump. This is about what\u2019s good for America.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do, unlike Donald Trump: I\u2019m not going to demonize immigrants. I\u2019m not going to say immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of the nation. I\u2019m not going to call immigrants and folks from Mexico \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers\u201d just because they\u2019re from Mexico. I\u2019m not going to separate families.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m gon- \u2014 I\u2019m not going to end \u2014 the thing that bothers me most \u2014 I met a \u2014 a young man yesterday with his mom and dad, who were immigrants, and he\u2019s a very good student. He was born in America. Trump wants to do away with birthright citizenship \u2014 a fundamental decision made by our founders: If you\u2019re born in America, you\u2019re an American no matter what. He wants to do away with that \u2014 to do away with that.\n\n\n\nI find it to be outrageous. You know, I\u2019m not going to ban people either because of their religion. That\u2019s not who we are in America.\n\nBut for all the threats Trump poses to our economy, our standing in the world, is \u2014 the greatest threat he poses: to our democracy. The violence on January 6th \u2014 Trump embraced it, and he\u2019s running on it.\n\nIf you watch any of his rallies, he\u2019s \u2014 calls the insurrectionists in pri- \u2014 who are in prison \u2014 calls them \u201cpatriots.\u201d And he says if he\u2019s reelected, he\u2019s going to pardon them all.\n\n\n\nTrump now says if he loses again in November that there will be a \u201cbloodbath.\u201d A \u201cbloodbath.\u201d\n\nFolks, we can\u2019t stand for all this. We have to say with one voice as Americans \u2014 as Democrats, as independents, as Republicans \u2014 there\u2019s no place in American politics for political violence ever. Period. Period. (Applause.)\n\nLet me close with this. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher, but with your help, we\u2019ll win up and down the ticket. That includes here in Texa- \u2014 I\u2019d love to see Colin take on Cruz \u2014 (applause) \u2014 so Ted can join loser Donald Trump. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nLook, there\u2019s a lot of focus these days on how old I am and how old Trump is. Well, the real question is: How old are our ideas?\n\nTrump\u2019s vision for America is one of anger, hate, revenge \u2014 seriously \u2014 and retribution \u2014 some of the oldest ideas known to humankind.\n\nI have a very different view for America, one that focuses on our future and answers whether \u2014 some very important questions: Will we be better off four years from now?\n\nWell, here\u2019s what I see.\n\nI see a future where we defend democracy; we don\u2019t diminish it.\n\nI see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect the freedoms that they\u2019re tak- \u2014 been taking away.\n\nI see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy begin to pay their fair share \u2014 and many of you do.\n\nI see a future where we save the planet from climate crisis and our country from gun violence.\n\nAbove all, I see a future for all Americans, you know, where we demonize no one, where we \u2014 hate has no safe harbor, where we leave nobody behind.\n\nThat\u2019s the future that we build together. That\u2019s the reason \u2014 that\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve never been more optimistic \u2014 I really believe it \u2014 as I go around the country. Our country is ready.\n\n\n\nLook, this is really a race about values between Trump and me, between us and Trump \u2014 a value set. Because I really do believe the American people are decent, honorable. They \u2014 they respect dignity.\n\n\n\nMy dad used to have an expression. My dad was a well-read man, and he got into Johns Hopkins when he was in Baltimore. He got into Johns Hopkins when we was \u2014 during the war \u2014 just before the war, but he ended up working in the shipyards and didn\u2019t get to go.\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s what he \u2014 he used to say, \u201cJoey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about respect. It\u2019s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \u2018Honey, it\u2019s going to be okay.\u2019 It\u2019s about just having an even chance. Not being given it \u2014 just an even chance.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, we have to remember who in the hell we are. We\u2019re the United States of America. And there is nothing \u2014 nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if \u2014 when we act together.\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here today. We\u2019re going to continue to do it. And with the grace of God and the goodwill of all of you, we\u2019re going to be able to do it.\n\nMay God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\n1:56 P.M. CDT",
