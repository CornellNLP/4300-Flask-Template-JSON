Photograph: Brendan Smialowskikamil Krzaczynski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump told his vice-president, Mike Pence, that refusing to block certification of Joe Biden\u2019s 2021 election victory at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 would be \u201ca political career killer\u201d, according to newly released testimony from a presidential valet.\n\n\u201cMike, this is a political career killer if you do this,\u201d Trump told Pence by phone on the morning of January 6, the New York Times reported, citing a transcript of testimony to the House committee that investigated the deadly attack on Congress that unfolded later that day.\n\nRelated: Mike Pence will not endorse Trump, but will not rule out voting for him\n\nAccording to the Times, the unnamed valet also said Trump appeared unconcerned when he was told a civilian had been shot dead as the Capitol was stormed.\n\n\u201cI just remember seeing it in front of him,\u201d the valet said of a card given to Trump as he watched the riot on television. \u201cI don\u2019t remember how it got there or whatever. But there was no, like, reaction.\u201d\n\nThe woman who was killed, Ashli Babbitt, has become a martyr to the Trumpist far right. Trump has called her a \u201cgreat patriot\u201d. The police officer who shot her outside the House chamber was cleared of wrongdoing, a judgment with which Trump disagreed.\n\nEight other deaths, including law enforcement suicides, are now linked to the Capitol attack, which happened after Trump told supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to overturn Biden\u2019s win, which according to Trump\u2019s lie was the result of electoral fraud.\n\nMore than 1,200 arrests have been made over the riot and hundreds of convictions and sentences secured. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted by Senate Republicans. He is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president, despite facing 88 criminal charges (14 concerning election subversion) and multimillion-dollar penalties in civil lawsuits. The US supreme court rejected attempts to keep Trump off the ballot under the 14th amendment to the constitution, which bars insurrectionists from office.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Times said it obtained the redacted transcript of the valet\u2019s testimony from House Republicans who claim the January 6 committee omitted from its hearings and report anything that did not suit its narrative.\n\nTranscripts contradicting sensational testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a close aide to Trump\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, have already been released.\n\nBarry Loudermilk of Georgia, the Republican leading the effort to undermine the work of the January 6 committee, told the Times there was \u201csome testimony in [the valet transcript] that may not be favorable to Trump\u201d but said: \u201cWe\u2019re putting it all out there, not doing what the select committee did, and putting things out there that will be favorable to our side.\u201d\n\nBennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chaired the January 6 committee, which included two anti-Trump Republicans, told the Times: \u201cDespite Mr Loudermilk\u2019s attempts to rewrite the violent history of January 6, the facts laid out in the select committee\u2019s final report remain undisputed \u2013 and nothing substantive was left out nor hidden.\n\n\u201cWhile the valet did not witness everything that happened in the White House that day, the testimony confirms Trump\u2019s indifference to the violence and his anger at Vice-President Pence for performing his duty under the constitution.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed valet said he did not remember Trump calling Pence what the Times called \u201can expletive meant to refer to a wimp\u201d, otherwise widely reported to have been the word \u201cpussy\u201d.\n\nAs the Times noted, Trump has not disputed the insult that was described to the January 6 committee by a former chief of staff to Ivanka Trump, the former president\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe valet also said he did not remember Trump or any staff member commenting on how rioters chanted for Pence to be hanged. Hutchinson told the committee she heard aides saying Trump said Pence \u201cdeserved\u201d such a fate.\n\nThe valet said he heard Trump ask aides about how to send national guard troops to the Capitol, a deployment that took several hours as chaos reigned and a contentious issue since.\n\nThe valet also described \u201cdisbelief\u201d among White House staff as the situation at the Capitol worsened and Trump persisted in watching TV.\n\nPence escaped the rioters and ultimately returned to the Capitol to preside over certification, despite objections from 147 Republicans in the House and Senate. According to Trump\u2019s valet, the president \u201cjust mentioned that Mike let him down, and that was it\u201d.\n\nTrump has been proved right, however, about Pence committing a \u201cpolitical career killer\u201d. Portrayed as a hero by the January 6 committee, Pence ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Failing to make an impact, he withdrew well before the first primary vote.\n\nLast week, he exacted a measure of revenge \u2013 by refusing to endorse Trump in his rematch with Biden.\n\nBut Pence also said his differences with Trump were \u201cnot personal\u201d \u2013 and refused to say he would not vote for him.",
