    "text": "Biden Announces Strictest Vehicle Emission Regulation Ever\n\nPresident Joe Biden unveiled the strictest regulation on vehicle exhaust emissions ever in the US in a bid to drive the sales of electric cars. The Environmental Protection Agency reported that this move will prevent 7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 30 years. It includes a target of 56% of all new US vehicles sold to be electric by 2032, a huge leap from the 8% of new cars EVs accounted for last year. Biden\u2019s measure limits the amount of pollution permitted from vehicle exhausts each year, with stiff fines awaiting carmakers who fail to comply. Car companies will be allowed to make gas-powered cars, as long as the percentage of their total product line shrinks. Donald Trump, in his bid to be re-elected, said he plans to reverse many of the environmental changes made by Biden. \"The rules will force Americans to buy ultra-expensive cars they do not want and cannot afford while destroying the US auto industry in the process,\" said Karoline Leavitt of the Trump campaign. The average sale price of an EV in 2023, according to Kelly Blue Book, was $53,500, $5,000 more than gas-powered vehicles.",
