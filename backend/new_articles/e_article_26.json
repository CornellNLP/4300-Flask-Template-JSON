    "text": "Republican opposition continued to grow Tuesday against a $118 billion bipartisan border deal and foreign aid package ahead of a key vote in the Senate.\n\nThe bill is now on track to fail, as GOP infighting threatens to steamroll any congressional response to the border as well put aid to Ukraine and Israel in jeopardy.\n\nDespite containing policy aimed at toughening border restrictions pushed for by conservatives, the deal has faced relentless attacks from former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who has said the bill would be dead on arrival in his chamber - if it ever makes it out of the Senate. Trump, who is hoping to make immigration a key plank of his presidential campaign, has suggested on Truth Social that approving additional resources for the border would make Republicans \u201clook bad.\u201d\n\nOffering a blunt assessment of the grim prospects facing the bill, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that the deal \u201cwill not become law,\u201d due to Johnson\u2019s opposition and concerns within the Senate GOP conference.\n\n\u201cWe had a very robust discussion about whether or not this product could ever become law, and it\u2019s been made pretty clear to us by the speaker that it will not become law,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo high-ranking members of Senate GOP leadership \u2013 John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, and John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican \u2013 announced that they will vote against the measure in an initial procedural vote on Wednesday, the latest blow to a deal that was negotiated by Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, one of the most conservative senators, along with Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut.\n\nA majority of Senate Republicans are now either actively planning to vote \u201cno\u201d during the first procedural vote on the package Wednesday or leaning against the bill. Many Republicans have attacked the policy directly, and some have argued there should be more time to consider, debate and amend the bill after it was released on Sunday evening.\n\nThune, the Senate GOP whip, said that he plans to vote against proceeding to the bill on Wednesday and said that blocking the package will be the \u201cpredominate position\u201d of GOP senators. Later in the day, Thune said, \u201cI would expect that the motion to proceed to the bill will fail.\u201d\n\nBarrasso, the chairman of the Senate GOP Conference, said in a statement, \u201cI cannot vote for this bill. Americans will turn to the upcoming election to end the border crisis.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer harshly criticized Senate Republicans on Tuesday for deciding to oppose the package as it is currently written, accusing them of acting on Trump\u2019s marching orders.\n\n\u201cWe all know what\u2019s going on here. Donald Trump would rather keep the chaos at the border so he can exploit it on the campaign trail, instead of letting the Senate do the right thing and fix it. He would rather let Ukraine suffer on the battlefield, instead of being tough on Putin,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd instead of standing up to Donald Trump, Senate Republicans are ready to kill our best chance at fixing the border and ready to vote down this aid package for Ukraine in order to put what they think \u2013 they think \u2013 is their party\u2019s political interest above the interests of the country.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic leader also went after Republican demands for more time to read the bill, noting that they had requested 72 hours, and saying he would offer to move the first procedural vote to Thursday if they want another day. \u201cI suspect they won\u2019t accept even that offer, because they really don\u2019t want more time. They\u2019re just using it as an excuse,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, another prominent senior Republican, said he plans to vote no on moving forward with the deal, adding that he wants to see changes to parts of the bill.\n\n\u201cWe need more time,\u201d Cornyn told CNN, adding later: \u201cI\u2019m a \u2018no\u2019 on the motion to proceed.\u201d\n\nMurphy, a key Democratic border deal negotiator, blasted Senate Republicans on Tuesday, calling them a \u201cdisaster\u201d and describing their treatment of Lankford, the top GOP negotiator, as \u201cdisgusting,\u201d saying he never expected they would leave him \u201changing out to dry as badly as they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never expected they would leave Senator Lankford hanging out to dry as badly as they did,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI thought they would be able to find the votes to support a very tough, conservative compromise that he was able to win.\u201d\n\nLankford said on Tuesday that he has been \u201cdisappointed\u201d in his colleagues who he says are mischaracterizing the package in order to reject it, rather than what is actually in the bill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s disappointing to me, is to say if you\u2019re going to disagree with it, disagree with it based on the facts of the bill, not something that\u2019s actually factually not true,\u201d he said, pointing to accusations that the package includes amnesty, allows thousands more migrants to enter the US, and incentivizes more people to cross the border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at the misinformation that\u2019s out there, and how effective that has been,\u201d added Lankford.\n\nHe acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s not looking good\u201d for the package to eventually become law, as more GOP senators demand more time to consider the language or reject it outright.\n\nOn Tuesday, McConnell said, \u201cI want to congratulate Senator Lankford on a remarkable job of negotiating with the other side, getting the support of the border council, but it looks to me and to most of our members is that we have no real chance here to make a law.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump and other Republicans have attacked the bill as too weak, it would mark a tough change to immigration law and would give the president far-reaching powers to restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board called the deal \u201cthe most restrictive migrant legislation in decades,\u201d saying \u201cits provisions include long-time GOP priorities\u201d in an op-ed titled \u201cA Border Security Bill Worth Passing.\u201d\n\nThe sweeping legislative package would also provide aid to key US allies abroad, including billions of dollars to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia and security assistance for Israel, as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Ukraine.\n\nIt is unclear if Congress will be able to pass aid to Ukraine and Israel separate from border measures as many Republican senators had previously demanded that the issues be paired together.\n\nAsked if Congress should drop the border elements of the package and pass the rest of the security supplemental for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Cornyn indicated he supported that approach.\n\n\u201cI would say defer the border and do the rest,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is pushing to pass a stand-alone Israel aid package on Tuesday, but that is also on the brink of collapse amid opposition from far-right Republicans and Democratic leaders, according to multiple GOP sources.\n\nPresident Joe Biden would veto a House standalone aid package for Israel, the White House said Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Administration spent months working with a bipartisan group of Senators to reach a national security agreement that secures the border and provides support for the people of Ukraine and Israel, while also providing much-needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by conflicts around the world,\u201d the White House wrote in a statement. \u201cInstead of working in good faith to address the most pressing national security challenges, this bill is another cynical political maneuver.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",
