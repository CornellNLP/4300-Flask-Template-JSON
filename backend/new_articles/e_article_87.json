Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., of lying to the media. He also alleged Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, Abbe Lowell, has tried to \u201csmear\u201d him, while defending what he described as a \u201csuccessful business career\u201d following his time in the Navy. Raskin jumped in, asking Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., if Bobulinski was subject to decorum rules, while Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., reportedly shouted \u201ckeep going, you fool!\u201d Bobulinski, who worked briefly with Hunter Biden in 2017 on a company called Sinohawk, has claimed to possess evidence showing the president profited from his son\u2019s business deals in China, including a widely cited email that allegedly references \u201c10% held by H for the big guy,\u201d which Bobulinski has repeated claimed is a reference to the president. Bobulinski\u2019s claims have never been verified, however, and multiple other witnesses have told the committee the president was not involved in his son\u2019s business ventures.\n\nTangent\n\nMoskowitz wore a Vladimir Putin mask around the Capitol before the hearing to mock Republicans for spreading allegations about the Bidens that reportedly stem from Russian disinformation.\n\nChief Critic\n\nRaskin accused Bobulinski of making \u201chazy allegations against the Bidens for the first time at a press conference choreographed by the Trump for President campaign,\u201d he said in his opening statement, referring to the 2020 press conference in which Bobulinski initially aired the allegations. Referencing the possibility that the GOP could make criminal referrals to the Justice Department based on their findings, Raskin said \u201ccriminal referrals require evidence of crime . . . and the only crimes we have seen are those of the GOP\u2019s own star witnesses alike,\u201d he said, referencing Alexander Smirnov, who claimed Biden and his son were involved in a bribery scheme and was recently indicted by the FBI for allegedly lying to the agency.\n\nKey Background\n\nBobulinski testified before the committee alongside former Hunter Biden business partner Jason Galanis and former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. The committee also requested Hunter Biden\u2019s appearance, but he declined to participate, with Lowell calling the hearing in a letter to Comer \u201can obvious attempt to throw a Hail Mary pass after the game has ended.\u201d The hearing comes as a growing number of Republicans have openly acknowledged the probe is unlikely to result in a formal impeachment of the president as it has not produced any evidence showing the president was directly involved in, or financially benefited, from business deals involving his son or other family members.\n\nContra\n\nParnas in his testimony before the committee repeated his claims that any damning information about the Bidens was the product of Russian disinformation, telling lawmakers \u201cevery person integral to this shadow diplomacy knew that the Biden corruption rumors were baseless,\u201d he said, accusing Fox News anchors and Trump allies, former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., of \u201cpushing a false narrative.\u201d Parnas, who was enlisted by Giuliani to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election, was later convicted of fraud and campaign finance violations for funneling money into the 2018 midterms to help a Russian national gain interest in the cannabis industry.\n\nRead More",
