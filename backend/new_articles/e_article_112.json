    "text": "(The Center Square) \u2013 President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the presumptive presidential nominees for their respective parties, won big again in Tuesday\u2019s primaries.\n\nTrump is projected to win Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Kansas, while Biden is projected to win Arizona, Illinois, Ohio and Kansas. Barring something unforeseen, the two are headed to a rematch of 2020 come November.\n\nBoth the Democratic president and Republican former president had already secured enough delegates to win their respective presidential nominations heading into Tuesday, and they will significantly increase those delegate counts after all votes are counted Tuesday night.\n\nVoters in Arizona also held Democratic and Republican primaries Tuesday. Democrats canceled their presidential primary in the Sunshine State, handing all of Florida\u2019s 224 delegates to President Joe Biden.\n\nAfter victories last week in the states of Georgia, Mississippi, Washington and Hawaii, Trump raised his delegate count to 1,247 before Tuesday, surpassing the 1,215 delegates needed to become the presumptive nominee. The nomination does not become official until the Republican National Convention in July in Milwaukee.\n\nA total of 350 GOP delegates will be awarded after Tuesday\u2019s primaries.\n\nBiden reached 2,107 delegates after last week\u2019s Democratic primaries, surpassing the 1,968 needed to secure the nomination. As with the Republican race, the Democratic nomination does not become official until the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago.\n\nA total of 379 delegates will be awarded after Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primaries.",
