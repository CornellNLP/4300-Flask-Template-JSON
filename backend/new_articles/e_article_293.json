    "text": "was \u201ccrypto,\u201d now \u201conchain\u201d\n\nOn the Unchained podcast on Friday, host Laura Shin wisely noticed that her guest \u2013 Coinbase\u2019s Jesse Pollak, who originally created his company\u2019s Layer 2 blockchain Base \u2013 was using the term \u201conchain\u201d rather than \u201ccrypto\u201d in the course of their conversation on the latest Ethereum upgrade.\n\nShe asked him why \u201conchain\u201d and not \u201ccrypto\u201d? He replied in part (edited):\n\n\u201c(\u2026) The thing that I think is really powerful is\u2026 instead of hearing \u2018crypto\u2019 or \u2018web3\u2019 and thinking about speculation, pump and dump and all of this legacy of the crypto industry that has really been driven by speculation for the last decade\u2026 people hear \u2018onchain,\u2019 they get to see it in a new light, they get to analogize it to \u2018online\u2019 \u2013 which is this thing that has transformed their lives over the last 20 years \u2013 and they see it first and foremost as a technology.\n\nThey say, \u2018If I come onchain, I can earn more money for my business or I can cut out the middlemen who are taking my creative work and profiting off of it. Or I can play this new game that wasn\u2019t previously possible, or I can collaborate and send money to anyone in the world instantly and for free\u2026.\n\nThose are not about speculation, it\u2019s not about making more money, it\u2019s about taking a technology and making your life better. I think that is the theme of onchain \u2013 it\u2019s about upgrading our systems.\n\nIt\u2019s about acknowledging that a lot of the stuff we\u2019ve been doing with money is built on systems that are 50-100 years old. And if we use technology, software, blockchains to build new experiences and to bring the world onchain, we actually make everyone\u2019s life better.\n\n(\u2026) Our mantra for the industry is that it\u2019s time for change. And it\u2019s time for us to embrace this new language \u2013 the language of \u2018onchain\u2019 \u2013 that really centers crypto as a technology change that is upgrading our systems to make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nmore tips:\n\n\u201cHow Ethereum\u2019s Dencun upgrade could lead to the rise of millions of Layer 3s\u201d (podcast) \u2013 Unchained\n\n\n\nwhat you should know: In addition to a mantra, Pollak\u2019s response could be the leading edge of a maturation for an industry. For cynics, the view could be that Pollak\u2019s serving another cupful of wishful crypto thinking.\n\ndigital assets taxes\n\nIn his Friday newsletter, Cap Hill Crypto\u2019s George Leonardo dissected the Biden Administration\u2019s new 2025 budget proposal which could impact digital assets. Leonardo writes, \u201cLike last year, the Budget proposes a tax on energy used for mining and several updates to the existing tax code aimed at incorporating digital assets.\u201d\n\nHe reviews the \u201cDigital Asset Mining Excise Tax\u201d and notes, \u201cThe Budget proposes a new tax on energy used for digital asset mining. Specifically, mining firms would have to pay a tax equal to 30% of the costs of electricity used for mining. The tax would be phased in over three years, with a rate of 10% in the first year, 20% in the second year, and 30% each year thereafter\u2026\u201d\n\nRead the Cap Hill Crypto breakdown.\n\nRep. Hill running\n\nPunchbowl News\u2019 The Vault newsletter reports that House Financial Services (HFS) Committee Vice Chair and Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion Chair French Hill (R, AR) is definitively running for the head of the HFS Republican caucus saying, \u201cCommunications Director Brooke Nethercott confirmed to us that Hill is in the running for the committee job overseeing Wall Street and the federal financial regulators.\u201d Read more (subscription).\n\nwhat you should know: It\u2019s a good sign for digital assets aficionados, but with the dwindling momentum for the majority House Republicans in the November general election, who controls the HFS agenda looks increasingly in question.\n\ncampaign finance\n\nCoinciding with pro-crypto super PACs expressing their interest in the primary, two candidates in the Maryland Senate primary have announced they are pro-crypto. Politico\u2019s Jasper Goodman reports that one of the candidates, Rep. John Trone (D), was one of 100 Democrat co-signers of Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s (D, MA) October 17 letter to the White House and U.S. Treasury expressing concern about crypto\u2019s connection to the financing of terrorism and Hamas in light of the October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel.\n\nTrone tells Politico he supports new digital assets regulation and adds, \u201cWe cannot let the U.S. fall behind in the global race for technological advancement and economic competitiveness.\u201d Read more.\n\nwhat you should know: Trone\u2019s House Committee appointments (Appropriations, Joint Economic Committee and Budget Committee) in the 118th Congress have been outside of the House\u2019s digital assets discussion in Financial Services and Agriculture. If the digital asset market structure bill [H.R.4763] can make it to the House Floor before the August Congressional recess, it will be interesting to see how he and other Dems would vote \u2013 especially with campaign \u201ckibble\u201d from Super PACs potentially waiting for them.\n\nuse case \u2013 DLT for finance\n\nA new study from Broadridge, a multi-billion dollar, public, fintech infrastructure company, says that distributed ledger technology investment is nearly matching the increase in investment in artificial intelligence (AI) by the world\u2019s financial industry today. See the report.\n\nLedger Insights covers the report and observes, \u201cOne of the questions asked whether DLT would reduce the need for custodians and clearinghouses for post-trade and issuance. Thirty-six percent of respondents agreed.\u201d Read the summary.\n\ncentralized decentralization\n\nIn the Financial Times, reporter Josh Oliver offers a long opinion piece on what\u2019s wrong with crypto. In the process, he offers a bulleted list beginning with centralization: \u201cTechnical explanations will almost always tell you that crypto\u2019s key attribute is that it is decentralised. It is not. This is problem number one.\u201d Read more.\n\nCoinciding with the essay, Oliver published a new book on crypto called, \u201cHype Machine: How Greed, Fraud and Free Money Crashed Crypto.\u201d\n\nstill more tips\n\nStarbucks Is Shutting Down Its NFT Rewards Program\u2014Will It Return? \u2013 decrypt\n\nEl Salvador Has Thousands More Bitcoins Than Previously Known \u2013 CoinDesk\n\nGenesis to Face Off Against Parent in Final Showdown Over Digital-Asset Disputes \u2013 The Wall Street Journal\n\nSam Bankman-Fried Should Get 40 to 50 Years in Prison, Prosecutors Say \u2013 The New York Times",
