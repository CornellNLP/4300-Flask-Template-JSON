    "text": "As if the Biden\u2019s needed more problems on the Hunter Biden front\u2026\n\nKathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, recently released her own memoir.\n\nIn \u201cIf We Break,\u201d she spills the beans about some of Hunter Biden\u2019s escapades.\n\nMatched with the laptop, this is going to be a problem if the media ever treats this story seriously.\n\nTelling All\n\nHunter and Buhle were married in 1993.\n\nThe couple split up in 2015 after it was revealed that Hunter was having an utterly disgusting affair with his dead brother\u2019s widow.\n\nThat relationship would also come to an end in 2019.\n\nIn her divorce filing, Buhle cited how Hunter had \u201cspent money on drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, and strip clubs.\u201d\n\nFox News also reported, \u201cDivorce lawyers for Hunter Biden and his ex-wife Kathleen Buhle were aware of money hitting Hunter\u2019s bank account from a Romania deal, emails show, appearing to contradict Buhle\u2019s previous claims she had her \u2018head buried in the sand\u2019 when it came to Hunter\u2019s finances.\u201d\n\nThis is a fairly big deal because Buhle has always claimed ignorance on this front.\n\nShe clearly knows something, so it is just a matter of how much.\n\nDuring Rep. Comer\u2019s (R-KY) investigation, he found that Buhle received $1 million, one of many Biden family members that received payments from Hunter\u2019s alleged business activities.\n\nHer book also revealed that the family finances were largely behind handled by Eric Schwerin, who was one of Hunter\u2019s business partners at the time.\n\nIn one communication, it was revealed that Schwerin was using Buhle as a conduit to communicate with Joe Biden.\n\nThe corruption is clearly there\u2026 but again, will the media ever take this seriously.\n\nSource: Conservative Brief",
