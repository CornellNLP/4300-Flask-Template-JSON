Note the strategic detail. pic.twitter.com/kt6GNdQD85 \u2014 Miranda Devine (@mirandadevine) January 23, 2023\n\nJoe Biden STOLE SCIF-designated classified documents and improperly stored them at the Penn Biden Center, his Delaware garage, his Virginia rental home, and his lawyer\u2019s Boston office.\n\nSome of the most highly sensitive documents were stored at Penn Biden Center in an unlocked office and closet.\n\nAccording to Special Counsel Robert Hur, Joe Biden kept more than 600 pages of classified documents in unlocked drawers/closets at the Penn Biden Center and stored some of them in dilapidated boxes in his Delaware garage and other unsecured locations where Hunter Biden could easily access them.\n\nThe FBI identified numerous folders, including many labeled \u201cEYES ONLY VPOTUS\u201d which contained highly classified material related to intelligence sources and methods.\n\n\u201cMr. Biden\u2019s office did not lock,\u201d Hur said in his 345-page report, \u201cand the adjoining outer office where Mr. Biden\u2019s executive assistant maintained his files was always accessible through Mr. Biden\u2019s office.\u201d In a footnote, Hur added that \u201cthe Vice President\u2019s office could only be locked from the inside using a panic button.\u201d\n\nVisitors from all walks of life, including dangerous actors from China and Ukraine had access to the classified documents stored at Penn Biden Center.\n\nThere was virtually no real security at the Penn Biden Center and in 2019 visitors no longer needed a key fob or security escort to access the floor where all of the stolen classified documents were stored, according to Hur\u2019s report reviewed by this reporter.\n\nRobert Hur also couldn\u2019t determine who had access to Biden\u2019s unsecured classified documents because the Penn Biden Center\u2019s security deleted all the visitor logs from 2017-2021.\n\nBiden was still not charged and none of his aides, handlers or gatekeepers were charged with obstruction or conspiracy (unlike Trump\u2019s aides).",
