(RELATED: Trump's Attorneys Drop Bombshell News)\n\nAccording to FEC filings reviewed by The New York Times, \u201cBiden's re-election campaign had $71 million on hand at the end of February, more than double the $33.5 million in former President Donald J.

The RNC reported Wednesday it had about $11 million in cash on hand at the end of February, trailing the Democratic National Committee's $26 million cash on hand.\n\nAt the beginning of March, Trump's campaign had $42 million in cash on hand, while Biden's operation reported $155 million.\n\nREAD NEXT: Study Reveals Death By Stroke And Heart Attack Up 450%!
