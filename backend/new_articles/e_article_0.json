Then in August, Maui was devastated by a fast-moving wildfire and Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast was slammed by its second major hurricane in two years.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Tuesday and is expected to unveil more than $6 billion in funding to strengthen climate resilience \u201cby bolstering America\u2019s electric grid, investing in water infrastructure upgrades, reducing flood risk to communities, and advancing environmental justice for all,\u201d an administration official said.\n\nThe US needs \u201ca transformation of the global economy on a size and scale that\u2019s never occurred in human history\u201d to \u201ccreate a livable future for ourselves and our children,\u201d White House senior climate adviser John Podesta told reporters.\n\nHere are five significant takeaways from the federal government\u2019s sweeping climate report.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to pinpoint which disasters were made worse by climate change\n\nThe latest report contains an important advancement in what\u2019s called \u201cattribution science\u201d \u2013 scientists can more definitively show how climate change is affecting extreme events, like heatwaves, droughts to hurricanes and severe rainstorms.\n\nClimate change doesn\u2019t cause things like hurricanes or wildfires, but it can make them more intense or more frequent.\n\nFor instance, warmer oceans and air temperatures mean hurricanes are getting stronger faster and dumping more rainfall when they slam ashore. And hotter and drier conditions from climate change can help vegetation and trees become tinderboxes, turning wildfires into megafires that spin out of control.\n\n\u201cNow thanks to the field of attribution, we can make specific statements,\u201d Hayhoe said, saying attribution can help pinpoint certain areas of a city that are now more likely to flood due to the effects of climate change. \u201cThe field of attribution has advanced significantly over the last five years, and that really helps people connect the dots.\u201d\n\nWhat's the weather forecast for 2050?\n\n04:18 - Source: CNN\nAll regions are feeling climate change, but some more severely\n\nThere is no place immune from climate change, Biden administration officials and the report\u2019s scientists emphasized, and this summer\u2019s extreme weather was a deadly reminder.\n\nSome states \u2013 including California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas \u2013 are facing more significant storms and extreme swings in precipitation.\n\nLandlocked states won\u2019t have to adapt to sea level rise, though some \u2013 including Appalachian states like Kentucky and West Virginia \u2013 have seen devastating flooding from rainstorms.\n\nAnd states in the north are grappling with an increase in tick-borne diseases, less snow, and stronger rainstorms.\n\n\u201cThere is no place that is not at risk, but there are some that are more or less at risk,\u201d Hayhoe told CNN. \u201cThat is a factor of both the increasingly frequent and severe weather and climate extremes you\u2019re exposed to, as well as how prepared (cities and states) are.\u201d\n\nClimate change is exacting a massive economic toll\n\nClimate shocks on the economy are happening more frequently, the report said, evidenced by the new record this year for the number of extreme weather disasters costing at least $1 billion. And disaster experts have spent the last year warning the US is only beginning to see the economic fallout of the climate crisis.\n\nClimate risks are hitting the housing market in the form of skyrocketing homeowners\u2019 insurance rates. Some insurers have pulled out of high-risk states altogether.\n\nStronger storms wiping out certain crops or extreme heat killing livestock can send food prices soaring. And in the Southwest, the report\u2019s researchers found that hotter temperatures in the future could lead to a 25% loss of physical work capacity for agricultural workers from July to September.\n\nThe US is cutting planet-warming pollution, but not nearly fast enough\n\nUnlike the world\u2019s other top polluters \u2013 China and India \u2013 planet-warming pollution in the US is declining. But it\u2019s not happening nearly fast enough to stabilize the planet\u2019s warming or meet the United States\u2019 international climate commitments, the report explains.\n\nThe country\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 12% between 2005 and 2019, driven in large part by the electricity sector moving away from coal and toward renewable energy and methane gas, the latter of which is still a fossil fuel that has a significant global warming effect.\n\nThe decline is good news for the climate crisis, but look at the fine print and the picture is mixed.\n\nThe report finds US planet-warming emissions \u201cremain substantial\u201d and would have to sharply decline by 6% annually on average to be in line with the international 1.5-degree goal. To put that cut into perspective, US emissions decreased by less than 1% per year between 2005 and 2019 \u2013 a tiny annual drop.\n\nLeading scientist explains how cities can help solve climate change\n\n03:13 - Source: CNN\nWater \u2013 too much and not enough \u2013 is a huge problem for the US\n\nOne of the report\u2019s biggest takeaways centers on the precarious future of water in the US, and how parts of the country are facing a future with either extreme drought and water insecurity, or more flooding and sea level rise.\n\nDrought and less snowpack are huge threats to Southwest communities in particular. The report\u2019s Southwest chapter, led by Arizona State University climate scientist Dave White, found the region was significantly drier from 1991 to 2020 than the three decades before.\n\nWhite said that\u2019s an ominous sign as the planet continues to warm, with significant threats to snowpack in California\u2019s Sierra Nevada mountains and the Rockies \u2013 both of which provide crucial freshwater in the West.\n\nWhite added that a lack of freshwater in the region also has significant economic and agricultural impacts, as it supports cities, farms, and Native American tribes.\n\n\u201cMountains are our natural reservoirs in the region,\u201d White told CNN. \u201cClimate impacts on that mountain snowpack have really significant negative effects for the way our infrastructure operates. It\u2019s just critical for us to protect those resources.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Donald Judd contributed to this report.\n        ",
