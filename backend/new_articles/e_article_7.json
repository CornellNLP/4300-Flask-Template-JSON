But wages are rising, unemployment is negligible, the stock market is soaring, we somehow brushed off both the Trump presidency and the pandemic.\u201d\n\nAnd hey, you can see pictures of naked women pretty much whenever you want.\n\n\u201cYes, inflation persists for a lot of things, but an actual good, nice-sized TV now costs 60 bucks. Who gets credit for that? We\u2019ve got next-day shipping, stuffed-crust pizza, legal weed, GPS and porn on the phone. Cheer the f\u2013k up!\u201d he scolded.\n\n\u201cStop acting like life in America in 2024 is unbearable. Biden\u2019s ratings are in the toilet not because he\u2019s doing such a bad job but because a lot of Americans like to live with their head in the toilet!\u201d\n\nMaher occasionally likes to pretend he\u2019s a man of the people since he tours Middle America on a private jet, but his comedy shows involve him speaking to an audience that he doesn\u2019t have to listen to.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to reconcile the struggle of the average American who hasn\u2019t seen a raise in wages in years and dares not complain because his or her choice of employment is more limited than the seating on Maher\u2019s private jet.\n\nIf he truly understood what\u2019s going on, he wouldn\u2019t think most Americans\u2019 economic satisfaction is related to the stock market\u2019s success \u2014 when the top 1% of earners holds ownership of 54% of the stocks, valuing more than $19 trillion.\n\nMaher minimizes the impact of inflation as a side dish to our economic woes when it\u2019s really the main course.\n\nAnd it\u2019s worse than the official numbers show.\n\nKeep up with today's most important news Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.
