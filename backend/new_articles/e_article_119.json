And instead of jumping the gun, it can sometimes help to pause, take a deep breath, and reexamine things a few days later.\n\nJust last week, President Joe Biden reached out to farmers and the rural community when his administration released the \u201cBillion Ton Report,\u201d announcing increased biomass production. This move will triple overall generation, advance sustainable aviation fuel, help tackle the climate crisis, and encourage the agriculture industry. Energy Secretary Granholm said this plan will take advantage of winter oilseed crops, microalgae from ocean farming, corn grain/ethanol, and carbon dioxide generated at industrial plants.\n\nAnd earlier this month, President Biden delivered a strong and energetic \u201cState of the Union\u201d speech, detailing issues important to the nation and to us here in Virginia and Amelia County. He explained how his administration has focused on growing our economy, promoting jobs, and ensuring that school teachers do not pay higher tax rates than billionaires and Fortune 500 corporations.\n\nPresident Biden has also emphasized strengthening women\u2019s rights and protecting our environment. His actions have reduced air pollution, promoted more clean energy initiatives, and ensured that family farms can stay in the family. He has strengthened worker union rights, built more roads and bridges, and constructed state-of-theart electric vehicle charging stations and broadband connections here in Virginia.\n\nPresident Biden has displayed a clear command of the issues facing our nation, our state, and our county.\n\nSincerely,\n\nStuart V. Price",
