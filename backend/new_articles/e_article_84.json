    "text": "Hmmmm?\n\nMaybe that State of the Union speech wasn\u2019t so bad after all?\n\nAccording to the FiveThirtyEight average, President Biden\u2019s approval rating is now above 40% for the first time since October.\n\n\u2026\n\nAt this stage of the race, Biden\u2019s team is probably focused on many different elements of voters\u2019 views of the President. However, addressing voters\u2019 concerns about the President\u2019s age is undoubtedly near the top of the list. The speech and Biden\u2019s ad campaign were designed to address that issue head-on.\n\nA recent Morning Consult poll shows that Biden\u2019s State of the Union made progress doing just that. According to the poll, the number of voters who say Biden is \u201ctoo old\u201d dropped by 3 points, but there was significant movement among Democrats (9 points) and Biden 2020 voters (8 points).\n\nThis is all good news. Biden\u2019s path to victory begins with winning back his 2020 voters. Trump\u2019s advantage in the polls is entirely because he is winning a higher percentage of his 2020 voters. In the New York Times/Siena poll, Trump has the support of 97% of voters who say they voted for him in 2020, while Biden only has 83% of his 2020 voters.\n\n.Navigator Research did a post-SOTU poll that found:\n\nSeven in ten Americans engaged with the State of the Union this year and a plurality viewed it positively; nearly three in five who watched at least part of the address were positive about the speech\u2026..\n\nMore\u2026.\n\nNote\u2026\n\nThe Right leaning Real Clear Politics also has Biden at 40.3% approval\u2026.",
