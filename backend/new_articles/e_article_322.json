Wednesday in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\u201cDonald, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help you,\u201d Biden said, drawing laughter and applause from supporters.\n\nBiden\u2019s financial advantage could help soothe Democratic nerves as the nation\u2019s oldest president suffers record-low approval ratings less than seven months into his rematch with Trump.\n\nDocuments filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday showed that the Biden campaign had $71 million in cash on hand as of the end of February, more than double Trump\u2019s $33.5 million in cash.\n\nIn February alone, the current president\u2019s campaign raised $21.3 million, nearly double Trump\u2019s $10.9 million. Meanwhile, Biden spent $6.3 million that month, but Trump spent more \u2014 $7.8 million.\n\nHowever, the numbers don\u2019t give a complete picture of any individual candidate, as documents from their various fundraising committees aren\u2019t due until April.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign said over the weekend that it had raised more than $53 million in February, for a \u201chistoric\u201d total of $155 million, which it said was the most money raised by a Democratic Party at this stage of the election cycle.\n\n-\u201cDumpster Fire\u201d-\n\nPerhaps Trump\u2019s most worrying factor is his massive legal bills as he faces criminal cases, including ones seeking to overturn his 2020 election defeat and keep secret documents.\n\nLegal fees accounted for a whopping $5.6 million of Trump\u2019s Save America PAC\u2019s expenses in February \u2014 money that could have been spent on campaign events and television ads.\n\nThe figures add to Trump\u2019s woes as he works to raise $464 million in bonds to appeal a fine imposed by a New York court for fraudulently inflating his wealth.\n\nThe 77-year-old now faces asset seizure, a humiliating blow to his carefully cultivated image as a dealmaker and self-made tycoon.\n\nTrump has called the fraud a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and, as usual, is trying to use the legal cases against him to inflame his supporters and get them to open their wallets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling on one million Trump-supporting patriots to say: Stop the witch hunt against President Trump!\u201d Wednesday\u2019s campaign message said.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cKeep your dirty hands away from Trump Tower,\u201d his flagship New York property that could be at risk of a court case.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump successfully raised a separate bond of $91.6 million as he appealed sexual assault and defamation convictions in a lawsuit filed by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign described Trump\u2019s finances as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s documents paint a bleak picture for the Republican Party,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Amal Moussa wrote Thursday.\n\nBut as the election approaches and Trump leads Biden in key battleground states in recent polls, Democrats will try to keep their war chest as deep as possible.\n\nBiden will join Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at a fundraiser in New York on March 28, the first such event to feature three Democratic presidents. One of the most profitable events in the party\u2019s history.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the gala will raise $10 million for Biden\u2019s campaign, and guests will have to pay $100,000 each to take photos with the 42nd, 44th and 46th President of the United States.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
