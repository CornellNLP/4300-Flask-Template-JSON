    "text": "Biden Campaign Mocks Trump\u2019s Low Fundraising Figures, Suggesting He Would Terminate Himself\n\nThe Biden campaign celebrated on Wednesday the significant fundraising success and financial advantage it holds over the Trump campaign.\n\nFormer President Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign reported a significant influx of funds in the past month, with a total of $10.9 million being brought in. Additionally, his joint fundraising committee managed to raise nearly $11 million during the same period. As of March, the campaign had approximately $42 million in cash available. These figures demonstrate the continued support and financial backing for Trump\u2019s future political endeavors.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s campaign operation outperformed those figures significantly. In the month of February alone, they managed to raise an impressive $53 million. As a result, they now have a whopping $155 million in cash on hand as they enter the month of March.\n\nAt BestReviews, we value our readers and want to provide them with the best recommendations.

As of the end of February, the RNC reported having approximately $11 million in available funds, which falls short of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s $26 million.\n\nThe former president, Trump, has been incurring significant legal fees due to his trial for four separate crimes, exacerbating the situation. He also has to pay a $454 million judgment soon because a judge in New York found that he lied about his assets to get tax and insurance benefits and was guilty of theft.\n\nWith interest piling on an additional $112,000 each day Trump doesn\u2019t pay, the former president owes the state about $457 million as of Wednesday.\n\nBiden will end his three-day trip to Nevada, Arizona, and Texas on Thursday. During that time, he held three events. Next week, he will be in New York City with former Presidents Obama and Clinton for a big benefit.\n\nReference Article",
