    "text": "Private Residence\n\nDallas, Texas\n\n7:24 P.M. CDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.) I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s been, but I want to go there. (Laughter.)\n\nRussell and Dori, thank you for your friendship. You know, you heas- \u2014 you hosted me the first time for a fundraiser in 2019. And it\u2019s fitting that you\u2019re hosting my first Texas fundraiser for 2024.\n\nA special thanks to all of you: Jaime Harrison and \u2014 the chair of the \u2014 of the \u2014 our \u2014 our party; Chris, our finance chair; and all the lawyers here today who care deeply about the rule of law and the frontlines of fairness and justice and \u2014 and deepening democracy and defending it, because I think it\u2019s at stake.\n\nYou know, folks, we\u2019re seeing incredible enthusiasm all over the country as we travel. Recently, I\u2019ve traveled to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Nevada, Arizona. And Jill and Kamala and Doug are traveling as well.\n\nOur grassroots support, thank God, keeps getting stronger. So far, over 1.3 million people have contributed to our campaign this time around \u2014 500,000 of them, brand new \u2014 and 97 percent of those contributions are $200 or less \u2014 97 percent of them.\n\nAnd we\u2019re ramping up our many campaign headquarters, off- \u2014 field offices across the country. We\u2019ve opened a hundred field offices so far and staffing them all now \u2014 and before Trump has opened a \u2014 and his MAGA Republican friends \u2014 have opened even one. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd while you probably haven\u2019t read about it, in the last few days, there have been five national polls where we\u2019re back to leading again in the polls. (Applause.)\n\nBut the truth is I\u2019m not sure any of them matter, because it\u2019s so hard to take polls these days. It really is. And not everyone is feeling the enthusiasm. Not everyone.\n\nJust the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and said, \u201cMr. President, I need your help. I\u2019m being crushed with debt. I\u2019m completely wiped out.\u201d I had to say, \u201cDonald, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) (Inaudible.)\n\nSpeaking of Donald Trump, just a few days ago, he asked a famous question in one of his rallies: Are you better off today than you were four years ago?\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Donald, I\u2019m glad you asked that question, man. (Laughter.) I hope everyone in the country takes a moment to think back what it was like in March of 2020.\n\nCOVID had come to America. Trump was president. Hospitals, emergency rooms were overcrowded. First responders were risking their lives. Nurses were wear- \u2014 were wear- \u2014 were wearing garbage bags because they couldn\u2019t have the protection in the hospitals they needed. There was a ventilator shortage. Morgues were being set up all outside, not just in the hospitals. And the loved ones were dying all alone. We couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to them.\n\nAnd unemployment shot up to 14 percent. The stock market crashed. Grocery store shelves were emply \u2014 and were empty. And we even \u2014 remember the whole toilet paper conference? (Laughter.) No, I\u2019m \u2014 think about how tough things were.\n\nYou know, months ago Trump tried to downplay the virus. He told us, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it will go away. Just stay calm. And we\u2019ll\u201d \u2014 remember he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be out of it by Easter\u201d? Well, over a million people died. And while \u2014 all while doing nothing.\n\nOf course, we now know Bob Woodward\u2019s book \u2014 that Trump was lying to the American people all along. He knew how dangerous the virus was, and he hid it from us. He just kept getting worse \u2014 worse and worse. He told Americans \u2014 remember he was telling \u201cinject bleach\u201d? He told us to hit the body with UV light. Well \u2014 (laughter).\n\nBut later, you know, he wanted to tear gas the photo op \u2014 for a photo op, out \u2014 because they protested justice in front of the White House.\n\nThen, after losing the 2020 election, Trump finished his presidency by sending an interrecti- \u2014 an insurrection mob to the Capitol. And, folks, look, there\u2019s \u2014 these folks \u2014 so many of them have been convicted. And he swears when he gets elected he\u2019s going to pardon them all \u2014 pardon them all \u2014 because they\u2019re \u201cheroes.\u201d\n\nBut four years later, look at where we \u2014 how far we\u2019ve come. Donald Trump is not president \u2014 that\u2019s the first thing \u2014 because of you. (Applause.) And I mean it \u2014 because of many of you.\n\nCOVID no longer controls our lives. We\u2019ve created 15 million new jobs \u2014 more jobs in that timeframe than any president has in American history. (Applause.) We have the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. We had record economic growth, new small-business creation record, stock market is highest it\u2019s ever been.\n\nInsulin now costs seniors 35 bucks instead of 400 bucks a month. Out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs for seniors are going to be capped at $2,000 a year, no matter what the total cost is.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t just save seniors money; it saves taxpayers significant amounts of money.\n\nBy just passing that law and what we\u2019ve done so far, we\u2019ve saved \u2014 we\u2019ve reduced the deficit by $160 billion \u2014 $160 billion. If you\u2019re not paying $400 instead of $15, and so on. Go down the line. I won\u2019t bore you with detail.\n\nWe\u2019re rebuilding the nation\u2019s roads and bridges. We\u2019re delivering clean water and high-speed Internet to every American, whether you\u2019re rural or no matter where you live.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is booming \u2014 800,000 manufacturing jobs and counting. And be- \u2014 you all know this as well as I do: We\u2019ve attracted over $650 billion dollars in private-sector investment in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors \u2014 all across America. (Applause.) We made the biggest investment in history to combat climate change. And we can do a lot more, of course, and we have to.\n\nInflation peaked at 9 percent a little over a couple of years ago \u2014 a year and a half ago. Now, it\u2019s dropped to 3 percent \u2014 the lowest in the world \u2014 and still dropping. We\u2019re going to do more \u2014 more to be done.\n\nSo, let me ask you: Does anyone here want to go back to 2020? (Laughs.)\n\nAUDIENCE: No!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, when fear ruled our lives, when Trump was president \u2014 I don\u2019t think so.\n\nBut, look, the problem isn\u2019t just going back to Trump ha- \u2014 where Trump had the country. The problem is he wants to take us \u2014 where he wants to take us now. Look at what he\u2019s saying, and I hope that we all begin to take seriously. He means what he says. As crazy as it sounds, he means what he says.\n\nHe wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Over 30 million Americans depend on the ACA. It would be a disaster for the \u2014 to be taken away.\n\nHe wants to get rid of the savings I just got put into law for prescription drugs at 35 bucks for \u2014 for insulin \u2014 for a whole range of \u2014 and he just wants to wipe it all out.\n\nYou know, and what he wants to do is enact another $2 trillion tax cut. Well, at the time, you know, he increased the deficit larger than any man in American history in four years \u2014 the deficit.\n\nHouse Republicans just proposed massive cuts in Social Security and Medicare. Trump recently said, \u201cSocial security and Medicare \u2014 there\u2019s a lot you can do to cut more.\u201d\n\nWell, folks, the climate \u2014 he\u2019s a climate denier. And he\u2019s going to do away with the historic action that we\u2019ve taken. There\u2019s a lot more to do. I\u2019m not suggesting we\u2019ve finished.\n\nBut another school shooting recently, and what did he say? He said \u2014 when asked about it, he said, \u201cJust get over it.\u201d \u201cJust get over it.\u201d\n\nNo \u2014 no, I want to stop it, not get over it. The idea our children are having to duck and cover in school. Did you ever think we\u2019d be in that position? Ever think we\u2019d be teaching kids that?\n\nLook \u2014 look at the judges he put on the bench. Imagine who else he\u2019ll put on the bench.\n\nOur reputation internationally has been crushed when he was president. Imagine what will happen if he\u2019s reelected. He wants to do away with NATO, and he wants to tell Putin to do whatever you want \u2014 do whatever you want.\n\nTrump boasts he \u2014 what I found so stunning: He recently hosted Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Prime Minister of Hungary, at Mar-a-Lago. And Orb\u00e1n says he doesn\u2019t think democracy works \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work. And that\u2019s who he admires most.\n\nHe brags about how he ha- \u2014 he\u2019s the reason Roe v. Wade is overturned and the freedom to choose is taken away. Look, and American needs to know: Donald Trump and his MAGA extremists are now calling for a national ban \u2014 a national ban on abortion in every state in the Union.\n\nFolks, one more thing. Trump didn\u2019t just bring chaos to the lives of women. He is also bringing chaos to the American border.\n\nWith a group of bipartisan senators we put together over a five-month period, the very conservative \u2014 a very conservative senator from Oklahoma heading the group \u2014 of a meeting for five \u2014 five solid weeks toward the end, we agreed on the strongest border security law in American history: 1,500 more Border Security agents and officers; 100 more immigration judges to tackle the backlog of 2 million cases; 4,300 asylum officers and new policy so they can resolve six \u2014 issues in six months instead of, now, six years; 100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly decrease the ability to \u2014 to smuggle in fentanyl and all its precursors.\n\nBut Trump \u2014 the problem is \u2014 I\u2019ve been around a while. I don\u2019t ever remember the leader of another party saying the reason they want to \u2014 their party to vote against something \u2014 not because it wasn\u2019t good but because he worried I would get too much credit for it \u2014 the other team would get credit for it.\n\nFolks, it wasn\u2019t about whether it\u2019s good for me or Trump; it\u2019s about what\u2019s good for America.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I \u2014 here\u2019s what I will not do. Unlike Trump, I\u2019m not going to demonize immigrants. I will not say immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood\u201d of this nation. I will not call immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and \u201cmurderers.\u201d I will not separate families, put kids in cages. I\u2019ll not end the birthright citizenship.\n\nNow, this guy actually wants to end \u2014 and he\u2019s \u2014 now he\u2019s bragging about it. He wants to end the right for birthright citizenship, which we established way back, a couple hundred years ago. If you\u2019re born in America, you\u2019re an American citizen. He wants to end that.\n\nI\u2019m not going to ban people because of religion. That\u2019s not who we are as Americans.\n\nFolks, but after all the threats Trump poses, to our economy, our standing in the world, is \u2014 the greatest threat he poses is to our democracy. Violence on January 6th \u2014 Trump embraced and he\u2019s running on it. He\u2019s running on it. He calls insurrectionists who are in prison \u2014 in prison \u2014 found guilty and in prison \u2014 he calls them \u201cpatriots.\u201d He suggests that they are, in fact, the ones who should be \u2014 and he swears if he gets elected, he\u2019s going to pardon them \u2014 pardon them all.\n\nTrump now says if he loses again in November, there will be a \u201cbloodbath\u201d in the streets.\n\nYou know, we didn\u2019t \u2014 when I got elected, and you helped me get elected in 2020, I \u2014 I made a speech on democracy at Independence Hall. I said we\u2019re in danger of losing the democracy if we don\u2019t win this thing. Well, folks, we can\u2019t stand for this stuff. We have to say in one voice as Americans \u2014 as Democrats, independents, and Republicans \u2014 there\u2019s no place for violence in America ever, ever, ever. Period. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I\u2019ll probably get her in trouble, but I just read what Liz Cheney recently said. She said, \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly vote for him, because democracy is at stake.\u201d And when asked, she said she\u2019d vote for Biden. The idea that a woman who is \u2014 has very different id- \u2014 ideas on policy than I do is so concerned that this guy gets reelected \u2014 what will happen.\n\nLook, let me close with this, because you\u2019re standing. You know, I couldn\u2019t be \u2014 the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher across the board. And with your help, we\u2019re going to win up and down the ticket. That includes here in Texas, because I want to see \u2014 you got to elect Colin your next senator. (Applause.) You got to so Ted Cruz joins another loser, Donald Trump. (Laughter.)\n\nLooks, there\u2019s a lot of focus these days on how old Trump is and how old I am. I\u2019m two \u2014 two times 40. But I \u2014 you know, what the hell? (Laughter.)\n\nThe real question is \u2014 all kidding aside \u2014 is how old are ideas? How old are our ideas?\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s vision of America is one of anger, hate revenge, retribution \u2014 some of the oldest known ideas to man.\n\nI have a very different vision for America, one that focuses on the future and answers questions \u2014 important questions: Are you better off now, and will you be better off four years from now?\n\nHere\u2019s the future I see, and I\u2019ll be brief. I see a future where we defend democracy and we don\u2019t diminish it.\n\nI see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect the freedoms, not take them away.\n\nI see a future \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy, the su- \u2014 you know, we have a thousand billionaires. I \u2014 I respect anybody who can make as much money as they can legally. But you know what their average tax \u2014 you know what the tax is of a \u2014 for those thousand billionaires in America? 8.2 percent. Anybody want to trade that rate? (Laughter.)\n\nNo \u2014 no, but I\u2019m serious. This \u2014 this is \u2014 you know, if \u2013 if they just got paid \u2014 if they just paid the 25 percent, do you know how much money that would raise? Four hundred billion dollars over 10 years.\n\nImagine what we could do \u2014 from everything from the deficit to taking care of kids, education, so many \u2014\n\nI see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.\n\nLook, I own weapons. I own guns. But this \u2014 from the very beginning, the Second Amendment didn\u2019t say you can own any weapon. You couldn\u2019t own a cannon. You couldn\u2019t own a \u2014 I\u2019m serious.\n\nAnd so, above all, I really do \u2014 I give you my word \u2014 I see a future for all Americans where we don\u2019t demonize one another and we give hate no safe harbor and we leave nobody behind. That\u2019s a future we can build together. That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about our future.\n\nMy dad used to have an expression, God love him. My dad was a high school-educated guy who was well-read. He got into Johns Hopkins. But during the war, he never made it to Hopkins.\n\nMy dad used to say, \u201cJoey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about respect. It\u2019s about having a chance. It\u2019s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \u2018Honey, it\u2019s going to be okay,\u2019 and mean it.\u201d Well, that\u2019s what this is about: giving everybody a shot.\n\nWe are the most incredible nation in the world. I know that sounds like I\u2019m bragging about our country, but I am. I think it\u2019s real. We\u2019re the only nation in the world, as I said before, that have come \u2014 come out of every crisis we faced stronger than we went in \u2014 stronger than when we went in.\n\nWe have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. And I believe with all my \u2014 every fiber of my being there\u2019s not a single thing beyond our capacity to get done when we act together. I mean that from the bottom of my heart.\n\nSo, God bless you all. Thanks for giving me a shot to do it again. And may God protect our troops. (Applause.) Thank you.\n\nEvery time I\u2019d walk out of my Grandfathers Finnegan\u2019s house in Scranton he\u2019d yell, \u201cJoey, keep the faith.\u201d And my grandmother would yell, \u201cNo, Joey. Spread it.\u201d Let\u2019s go spread it.\n\nThank you. (Applause.)\n\n7:39 P.M. CDT",
