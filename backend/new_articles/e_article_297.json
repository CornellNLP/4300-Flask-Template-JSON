    "text": "Anatomy Of The Tech-Industrial Complex\n\nAuthored by Josh Stylman via the Brownstone Institute,\n\nIn the news this week, there is a lot of controversy over the US House of Representatives voting on Bill HR7521 which gives the Executive Branch of government the power to control and/or censor the content on websites and apps that are considered to be foreign-owned.\n\nThe public debate centers around the Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok, which collects massive amounts of data and has remarkable influence over American citizens, especially kids. Proponents of the bill argue that TikTok is a danger to our sovereignty as a country because of its foreign ownership.\n\nOn the other hand, critics of the legislation assert that the bill enables the largest control grab since the Patriot Act, empowering the president with unilateral authority to determine which businesses are permitted to operate in the US.\n\nAs the TikTok question is taken up, it is timely for a review of the origins of our major tech platforms and an examination of their troubling interconnectedness with the federal government.\n\nOver the last few centuries it has been widely understood that power was generally acquired by leveraging rich natural resources, money, and/or a strong military. As globalization has evolved and humans across the planet have become interconnected with access to an unprecedented amount of information at their fingertips, one can make a case that the control of this information has become the most important weapon in the power arsenal. Whoever controls the narrative, sways public opinion, guides individual and group behaviors, and paves the way for powerful institutions and individuals alike.\n\nAs the TikTok debate highlights, it\u2019s evident in the Information Age that no one is more capable at framing and shaping events and ideas from a particular point of view or set of values than the large tech companies. These entities possess a worldwide audience of billions of people every minute of every day.\n\nMany, including me, have completely morphed their media habits over the last couple of decades and now look to social media as a guide for world events instead of reading newspapers. Cognitively, many of us know that in order for tech to provide personalized experiences that may seem more convenient in the short term, they may make ethical compromises related to transparency, data collection, privacy, user autonomy, and other exploitative practices designed to manipulate us.\n\nNevertheless, in aggregate, we tend to ignore these trade-offs. Whether it\u2019s swaying elections, pressuring for the mass experimentation on humans with novel drugs, or denying biology as a mere construct, given the sheer size of their audience combined with algorithmic and other technological capabilities, it is indisputable that Big Tech plays an outsized role to socially engineer our society.\n\nSometimes this stewardship comes from directing our attention to so-called experts whom we are supposed to follow for guidance. In other instances it\u2019s merely lying by omission by presenting only one side of the conversation to give the illusion of consensus. Recent examples include Covid, climate change, gender-affirming care, and a number of other social and political issues.\n\nOne might argue that if there really were legitimate dissenting views on any of these controversial topics, investigative journalists would surely be exposing the truth to us. After all, it is the sacred duty of the Fourth Estate to provide citizens with information to keep the power structure in check. I used to think that.\n\nEven if there are assiduous reporters working at large news organizations, it is obvious to anyone who\u2019s been watching the rampant censorship within Big Tech over the past few years that the institutions who distribute the stories to the public are subject to the oversight and control by the United States Government.\n\nThe prevailing wisdom in dissident circles is that social media platforms\u2019 censorship of voices unfriendly to government narratives represents some sort of recent institutional capture. But what if the oversight or pressure from the government to \u201ccontent moderate\u201d is not a result of recent capture and not a new phenomenon? What if it is a manifestation of a longer-standing government plan to fund the start-ups of these powerhouse companies with a view toward making nefarious use of them later?\n\nIf you think this sounds too far-fetched to be true, consider that the federal government that was recently found to collude with Big Tech to interfere with free speech is the very same institution that ran Operation Mockingbird, a covert CIA project designed to bribe individual journalists and worldwide media organizations in order to affect public opinion through the manipulation of news reporting.\n\nIn an investigative analysis by Carl Bernstein in 1977, the CIA admitted that at least 400 journalists and 25 large organizations around the world had secretly been bribed to create and distribute fake news stories on behalf of the agency. Since then, the technology that can be used to modify and even control our thinking has become orders of magnitude more powerful, refined, and sophisticated. Keep this in mind as we go through a quick thought exercise.\n\nBefore we do, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that even the mere possibility of the web being a trap hits close to home because not only do I absolutely love the Internet, but this field is how I\u2019ve supported myself and my family since I was a young man.\n\nWhen I started doing this work in the mid-90s, I thought I was a cynical person who asked critical questions, but in reality, I was a youthful wide-eyed optimist. I genuinely believed in the earnest notion of combining hard work with luck and in the idea of founders building independent world-changing companies.\n\nIn fairness, I do know many people who did just that. However, an exploration into the major tech companies which make possible the web\u2019s superpowers raises some questions about their roots, and whether their meteoric rises were in fact organic.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Amazon. Jeff Bezos\u2019 grandfather, Lawrence Preston (L.P.) Gise, was Director at the Atomic Energy Commission, and helped to form the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), from which ARPAnet evolved. During his tenure, Gise approved and provided funding for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) \u2013 which would eventually invent the Internet.\n\nIt makes sense that Bezos might grow up to have interest in this area. After all, if your grandfather was a founding father of the internet, I imagine you might be drawn to the web too. But why hasn\u2019t this part of the Amazon CEO\u2019s history been widely publicized?\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot about Bezos through the years and he\u2019s most often described simply as a hedge fund guy with a great idea. Perhaps that\u2019s true, but it is interesting that even puff pieces about Bezos learning his technical skill from his grandfather omit his forebear\u2019s early internet connections.\n\nThe Amazon founder gives other examples of his grandfather\u2019s work ethic and self-reliance. One summer, the two built a house from scratch and he also recalled helping his grandfather fix a broken bulldozer.\n\nIt is possible the author wanted to focus on the folksy DIY angle, but while \u201cPop\u201d Gise may have been a resourceful homesteader, he was also one of the pioneers of one of the most important technological innovations in human history \u2013 not to mention the infrastructure on which Jeff built his empire. If I were writing about how young Jeff was influenced by his grandfather, that feels quite relevant.\n\nInterestingly, Jeff\u2019s Wikipedia page mentions that his grandfather was \u201ca regional director of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque\u201d but it doesn\u2019t mention DARPA or the internet. Bezos\u2019 mother\u2019s entry doesn\u2019t even mention L.P. Gise by name. Is it plausible that these omissions are simply clumsy oversights?\n\nWhile Amazon ostensibly started out as an online bookseller, it has evolved into what can arguably be called a full-service data collection vehicle. They collect your personal information via your online store orders of items physical, virtual, and pharmaceutical. Amazon can see who is coming in and out of your living space with Ring, acquired in 2018, and has the technical capability to listen to conversations of more than half a billion people through Alexa devices installed in homes, offices and dorm rooms. Most recently, Amazon has added One Medical which provides 24/7 on-demand virtual care from \u201clicensed providers\u201d and for those who live near brick-and-mortar locations, in-person visits. Customers are assured that their information is confidential, but would it remain so should the government bring pressure on Amazon to give it up in an \u201cemergency?\u201d\n\nJust last year, Amazon settled a $30.8 million lawsuit for claims that it improperly retained children\u2019s Alexa voice recordings and Ring videos, along with related geolocation information, for years \u2013 in some cases without consent and despite requests by consumers for the data to be deleted. They also enabled employees of its Ring video unit to survey customers. One Ring employee viewed thousands of video recordings of female users of security cameras that monitored bedrooms and other private spaces in their homes, the Federal Trade Commission said in a complaint. In a separate incident, the company was recently fined in France for their rigorous employee surveillance program. That same intrusive system was also cited in a study as the cause of suffering physical injuries and mental stress on the job.\n\nPerhaps because of their embarrassing failures, Ring recently succumbed to pressure from privacy advocates who criticized them for letting police departments request users\u2019 footage without a warrant. They eventually did the right thing and respected their customer\u2019s privacy, but given Amazon\u2019s very close relationship to the federal government as a provider of cloud services, what happens when the lettered agencies call asking for warrantless audio and video footage from someone\u2019s private life?\n\nNow let\u2019s consider Google, a company that many people believe to be an unquestionably reliable source of facts and arbiter of truth. The popular origin story of the web search titan is that it was the brainchild of two scrappy boy-geniuses at Stanford who were looking for a better way to find and present the ever-growing depth and breadth of information being uploaded to the web.\n\nConspicuously missing from that official story is the part about how Google started in 1995 as a DARPA-funded grant project for the CIA & NSA joint Massive Digital Data Systems Program.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s Wikipedia page details the account of how they got seed funding from a few Silicon Valley luminaries, it fails to mention that some of the research that led to Google\u2019s ambitious creation was funded and coordinated by a research group established by the intelligence community to develop and implement ways to track individuals and groups online. If that part of the account hadn\u2019t been erased from the history books, do you think Google would have quickly gained the trust of billions of people around the world?\n\nWhile I never bought into their over-the-top \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d schtick, I naively believed that people leading the company were motivated primarily to improve the planet by offering global access to the world\u2019s information. Maybe that\u2019s true\u2026but, Google turned out to be a pretty darn good spying vehicle too.\n\nThere was a time when my unsophisticated brain thought the power Google maintained was merely to suck in all of our data to manipulate us with advertising, but it\u2019s become so much more. As their services have expanded to mail, geolocation, content publishing, AI, telecommunications, payments, and seemingly everything else one would need for managing all facets of their digital existence, it\u2019s become apparent that search was merely the on-ramp for their data capture enterprise.\n\nThis makes sense when you consider the central role search engines play in modern life. For the first time in human history, people in every country in the world willingly ask machines questions and perform queries about everything on their minds. These inquiries can range from mundane trivia to how-to content to more confidential things like highly private health concerns.\n\nGoogle\u2019s ties to intelligence have continued beyond the very early days of the company. In 2004 they bought Keyhole (now Google Maps) from In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u2019s investment arm also backed by the FBI, NGA, Defense Intelligence Agency, and others. Do you think this was a straight-up financial transaction or is it possible that there were strings attached?\n\nOther intel ties include Google and the CIA co-investing in assets like Recorded Future, which monitors the web in real time in an attempt to create a \u201ctemporal analytics engine\u201d (a Minority Report-style program that makes predictions about future events), and Google\u2019s participation \u2013 along with other tech giants \u2013 in the NSA\u2019s PRISM program, which collected data from users on their platform without users\u2019 permission or a search warrant. In 2006, the company launched Google Federal to serve government contracts. This division in the company had so many former NSA staffers that it was often referred to as NSA West.\n\nMore recently, it was uncovered that Google employs more than a few former CIA agents and other ex-high level government employees in key roles including those who determine \u201cwhat content is allowed\u201d on their platform.\n\nAs civilians, most of us think we\u2019re searching the entire web, but Google has acknowledged that they are presenting only what their censors, partially made up of former intel agents, decide is appropriate. Based on the PRISM revelations, it\u2019s also apparent that the content we do consume has, at least for a period, illegally been shared with our government. Sweet.\n\nTo further illustrate how internet companies can be quite cozy with government and intelligence agencies, consider these fun tangential facts related to the (pre-Google) early days of web search: Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s twin sisters, Christine and Isabel Maxwell were the founders of Magellan, one of the first search engines on the internet (eventually, acquired by Excite).\n\nAfter Magellan, Christine started Chiliad, a data mining company working with the CIA, NSA, DHS, and FBI on \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d efforts. During this time, Isabel\u2019s company Cyren (previously Commtouch) had some very sketchy ties to Microsoft and Silicon Valley companies, allegedly possessing a backdoor into them. Christine now serves as UK and US Technology Pioneer for the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe Maxwell sisters\u2019 father, Robert, was widely rumored to have ties to organizations including MI6, KGB, Mossad, and the CIA. It is not fair to surmise his entrepreneur daughters were in the espionage business by mere association with their father and infamous sister \u2013 or even because of their contracts with the intelligence agencies. Still, it feels noteworthy.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that since the early days of search all the way to the present, the fact that we often don\u2019t think about who or what is on the other side feeding the results in this curiously intimate relationship with the search bar is arguably a feature not a bug.\n\nIf search is the brain tapping into the collective consciousness of what people are looking for online, social media is the soul, monitoring and connecting users based on what they\u2019re sharing. The former is predicated on intent whereas the latter is more about identity and interests.\n\nWhile both can be used as tools to amass a trove of data, search is more transactional since the user performs a query, finds the results and moves on, whereas social is more about creating virality and binding people together through the social graph.\n\nThe Pentagon (specifically, DARPA) apparently foresaw the usefulness of collecting the breadcrumbs of people\u2019s behavior when they started working on LifeLog, a project to track a person\u2019s \u201centire existence\u201d online. It\u2019s ambiguous what happened but they shut the project down on Feb 4, 2004.\n\nAs fate would have it, that same day \u2013 February 4, 2004 \u2013 was the day that Facebook (then, TheFacebook) launched at Harvard. That is a weird coincidence that Aaron Sorkin didn\u2019t mention in the movie version, but it\u2019s probably nothing. DARPA even denied having a connection, so I guess we\u2019ll have to take them at their word.\n\nLike their cohorts at Google, Facebook seems to be hiring from the intelligence community at a rapid pace. Recruiting from agencies including the CIA, FBI, NSA, ODNI, as well as other government departments including DOJ, DHS, and GEC, Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, has hired more than 160 former intelligence employees since 2018. Collectively, many of these employees are involved in the so-called Trust & Safety team (naturally) determining what content gets amplified, fact-checked, and/or taken down entirely.\n\nWhen Matt Taibbi, Michael Shellenberger, and other journalists released the Twitter Files last year, it became unmistakable that Twitter was yet another Big Tech platform that had direct ties to the US surveillance apparatus.\n\nSimilar to Google and Facebook, they also had a number of ex-spooks under their employ, including an alarming number of FBI agents. It is unclear if and how Twitter (no, I still won\u2019t call it X) has been working with the government since Elon Musk took over.\n\nThere is, however, an overwhelming amount of evidence that prior to the acquisition, the government exerted influence on the company to create guardrails around the content that got presented and even flagged specific users as being potentially dangerous. That is a lot of power to wield in shaping the hearts and minds of the masses.\n\nThis might just be another odd synchronicity but Project Bluebird was the original codename for what became the government\u2019s MK Ultra Mind Control Program. Goals for Bluebird included \u201cobtaining accurate data from persons willing and unwilling\u201d and \u201cincrease compliance to suggested acts.\u201d It\u2019s interesting to consider that in the context of the iconic \u2013 and now retired \u2013 company logo. Who knows if that\u2019s just a creepy coincidence or some sort of signal that insiders have been aware of all along?\n\nSo, are all the official origin stories of tech companies finessed at best, entirely fabricated at worst? There sure are a lot of uncanny ties to the intelligence community and this essay just scratches the surface. Maybe they\u2019re all just coincidences but in doing a little research, these parallels caught my attention so I thought it worth pondering.\n\nIf the intent behind these organizations was always a myth, personally, I feel as duped as anyone. I worked in tech for decades before tapping out when realizing many of the people coming into the field were no longer idealists wanting to democratize the world\u2019s information. Instead, they operated more like cartoonish bastard children of Hollywood and Wall Street.\n\nStill, until the last few years, I didn\u2019t understand just how sinister these corporations might be in their participation in activities beyond generating a profit for their shareholders. For a while I\u2019ve understood the danger we face from the banksters, Big Needle, traditional media execs, etc., but I didn\u2019t truly comprehend that the world I thought I lived in was, in large part, an illusion. After all, we live in a society overrun with fake money, fake foods, fake news, fake wars, fake credentials, fake medicines, so why would the giant foundational companies on the Internet be any different?\n\nRegardless of whether the ascent of these Internet behemoths was a deception or not, they are now incontrovertibly in cahoots with the Data Industrial Complex. Whatever one might think of TikTok, the debate around whether it needs to be brought under US ownership or else banned does beg the question of why United States ownership is so crucial right now.\n\nIs there genuinely a national security risk being addressed or do legislators \u2013 and more importantly, their donors \u2013 simply want it to be under American jurisdiction so they can control it like they do the other large tech companies? I think Brownstone\u2019s Jeffrey Tucker best summarized our choices with this tweet the other day:\n\nIf there are any silver linings here, it is that many people are waking up and demanding transparency and authenticity \u2013 and seemingly no one is going to the other side. A truly woke society will be glorious. The only question is are there enough of us before the unsuspecting masses get so propagandized they morph into the borg. I sincerely believe this is one of the defining issues of our time.",
