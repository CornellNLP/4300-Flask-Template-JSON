    "text": "Texas immigration law SB4 gives the state power to secure the border and deport illegal immigrants to Mexico \u2014 since the federal government is refusing to do so.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court allowed the law to remain in effect while the Biden administration challenges it, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has decided to stop it.\n\n\u201cYesterday, the Supreme Court said Texas can begin arresting, and then, I get up this morning and the appellate court says, \u2018No, no, no, not so fast,\u2019\u201d Glenn Beck says to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nPaxton is completely floored by the decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it; I don\u2019t understand it,\u201d Paxton tells Glenn, adding, \u201cit\u2019s bizarre.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we have going on here is a whole lot of harm. We have crime, we have killers, we have just an invasion of our border,\u201d Glenn says. \u201cIt should be that the court should say, \u2018No, no, no, let them arrest until we look at everything. Instead, the harm that is being perceived, I guess by the court, is to the illegal alien.\u201d\n\nPaxton believes it's not just illegal immigrants who the court is afraid of harming.\n\n\u201cYes, to the illegal aliens and to the Biden administration\u2019s partnership with cartels, that\u2019s the harm. We are harming the cartel relationship, and I don\u2019t know how else to put it,\u201d Paxton says.\n\n\u201cIf the court defends this, if they block us from enforcing legitimate path law by the legislature signed by the governor, then they are saying, \u2018We want to protect any harm that might come to the illegal immigrants and to the Biden administration\u2019s work with the cartels,\u2019\u201d Paxton adds.\n\nWant more from Glenn Beck?\n\nTo enjoy more of Glenn\u2019s masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, subscribe to BlazeTV \u2014 the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.",
