    "text": "President Biden and his administration just announced one of the most significant climate regulations in our nation's history! This new rule aims to ensure that most new cars sold in the US will be electric or hybrids by 2032.\n\nThis ambitious effort will cut down on carbon emissions that are driving climate change, and is an integral part of President Biden's plan to move our country into a clean energy future.\n\nNot surprisingly, Republicans are whining and howling about it.\n\nWe want to thank President Biden for having the courage and political will to take action to address the climate crisis. With Trump and Republicans already spouting their climate denial and fighting this important step forward, we need to show strong support for climate action.\n\nAdd your name: Thank President Biden for taking bold action to fight climate change >>",
