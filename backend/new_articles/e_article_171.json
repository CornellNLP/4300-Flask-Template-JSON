    "text": "To paraphrase the brilliant Oscar Wilde, there is only one thing in the world worse than to be insulted by Donald Trump. And that is to not be insulted by Donald Trump.\n\nWhen Kim Jong-un called Trump the \u201cmentally deranged US dotard\u201d, the then-American leader shot back that \u201clittle rocket man\u201d was a \u201csick puppy\u201d. Two years later Trump embraced him: \u201cI like him, I get along with him great. We have a fantastic chemistry.\u201d\n\nWhen Pope Francis said Trump was \u201cnot Christian\u201d because he was \u201ca person who thinks only about building walls\u201d, Trump denounced the Pope as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and predicted the Vatican would be attacked by the terrorist army of Islamic State.\n\nA year and a half later Trump said Francis was \u201creally wonderful, a great guy\u201d.",
